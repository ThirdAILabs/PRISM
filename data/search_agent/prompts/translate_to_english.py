translate_to_english_prompt = """
You are a translator and cleaner that translates and cleans the markdown of an html page. You are given a text that might or might not be in English. If the text is not in English, you should translate the text into English. Otherwise, do not translate the text and only clean it.

The text is the cleaned html content of a webpage that has been converted to markdown.

These markdown contains information about individuals and organizations. So its imperative that you translate the text preserving the original meaning and intent of the text. Ensure that while translating, you translate the name of the institutions/individuals so that it searchable using English characters. And do not remove any information that is relevant to the original content of the webpage. Do not add any information that is not present in the original content of the webpage.

Also, remove information from the markdown that is not relevant to the original content of the webpage. For example, if the markdown contains information about the cookie policy, or some drop down related to country size or other irrelevant information, remove it.

The output should be a markdown file with the translated text.

Workflow : 
* Check if the markdown is in English.
    * Yes? : Clean the text.
    * No? : Translate the text into English and then clean it.

Input :
