            "article_text": "Letter to Admin to Investigate Chinese Biotech Company, WuXi AppTec February 12, 2024 Letters Chairman Mike Gallagher (R-WI) and Ranking Member Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL), alongside Senator Gary Peters (D-MI) and Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN), sent a letter to the Departments of Treasury, Defense, and Commerce calling on them to investigate Chinese biotech company, WuXi AppTec, and its subsidiaries, citing WuXi AppTec's alarming ties to the Chinese military (the People's Liberation Army or PLA), the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the CCP's human rights abuses. As a result, the lawmakers request that the agencies consider adding WuXi AppTec and its subsidiaries to the Department of Defense's Chinese Military Companies List (1260H list), the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security Entity List, and the Department of Treasury's Non-SDN Chinese Military-Industrial Complex Companies List. The lawmakers write, 'WuXi AppTec and WuXi Biologics are rapidly becoming a global pharmaceutical and research-services giant that threatens U.S. intellectual property and national security. Both companies have close ties to the CCP and have worked at its behest, in multiple instances.' Based on a carful review of open-source information, the lawmakers found that: WuXi AppTec chairman has commended CCP branch work in the company and has called on Party branches and members to play an active role in the company. WuXi Biologics CEO has linked the company's success to local CCP support and pledged to work with Party officials to help reduce PRC reliance on foreign technologies in the field of biomedicine WuXi AppTec built and operates the PRC's 'State Key Laboratory of Drug Lead Compound Research', which carries out research to promote the Chinese economy and military build-up WuXi AppTec has a 'management committee' that is staffed by Chinese military personnel and other Party officials WuXi AppTec has received investment from numerous PLA investment funds, including from organizations with a stated goal of investing in companies directly tied to military-civil fusion and military production WuXi AppTec operates genetic testing centers established in coordination with the PLA. Genetic testing allows the CCP to identify and separate Uyghurs Muslims from other residents. This practice has been a key pillar of the CCP's genocide in the region In January, the lawmakers introduced a bill that would ban federal dollars from going to foreign adversary biotech companies, like WuXi AppTec and BGI. Additionally, Chairman Gallagher and Ranking Member Krishnamoorthi are currently leading a delegation of Select Committee in Boston, where the lawmakers will meet with biotech companies and experts.",

            "article_text": "PORTLAND, Ore.\u2014A federal jury in Portland found a Pennsylvania man guilty today for distributing a fentanyl analogue on AlphaBay, a former darknet marketplace, that caused the overdoses of three people in Oregon, two of whom died.\n\nHenry Konah Koffie, 37, of Darby, Pennsylvania, was found guilty on two counts of distribution of a controlled substance resulting in death, one count of distribution of a controlled substance resulting in serious bodily injury, and five counts of distribution of a controlled substance.\n\n\u201cHenry Koffie sold illicit fentanyl analogues on the darknet, exploiting profits while risking the lives of many Americans addicted to dangerous opioids. Today, fentanyl can be purchased for less than a few dollars in many American cities. The mass availability of fentanyl in our country is staggering and represents a profound public safety and health threat,\u201d said Steven T. Mygrant, Chief of the Narcotics and Criminal Enterprises Unit of the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Oregon. \u201cWe in law enforcement will continue doing our part to hold fentanyl dealers like Henry Koffie accountable, but we implore all community members to be vigilant in protecting themselves and their loved ones. If you possess pills not dispensed by a licensed pharmacist, assume they are fake and contain a deadly dose of fentanyl.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s conviction of Henry Koffie for distributing fentanyl on AlphaBay resulting in the overdoses of three people, two of whom died, serves as a reminder of the grave danger posed by the illegal distribution of synthetic opioids,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Robert Hammer, who oversees Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) operations in the Pacific Northwest. \u201cUsing the darknet does not provide anonymity. HSI special agents are highly skilled in conducting investigations that involve darknet markets, cryptocurrency transactions, and other illicit online activities. HSI will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to investigate and bring to justice those who contribute to the opioid epidemic that has devastated communities across America.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe conviction of Henry Koffie was possible due to the excellent relationships between federal and local law enforcement in Portland. The United States Postal Inspection Service values our partnerships with the Portland Police Bureau, Homeland Security Investigations, and United States Attorney\u2019s Office which led to the conviction of this purveyor of death on a national scale. Koffie\u2019s reckless lack of regard for the lives of others is reprehensible and ends here. We hope this verdict allows the victims and their families to start the healing process,\u201d said Tony Galetti, Inspector in Charge of the United States Postal Inspection Service (USPIS), Seattle Division.\n\n\u201cTo see the senseless loss of life through overdoses caused by dangerous and illegal drugs is heartbreaking for families and our community,\u201d said Assistant Chief Art Nakamura of the Portland Police Bureau (PPB). \u201cWe hope this verdict is the first step in healing for the families involved. This is a great example of the impact law enforcement can have when they join efforts to combat illegal drugs that are inflicting harm on our communities. Thank you to the Narcotics and Organized Crime Unit and our partners, including Homeland Security Investigations, the FBI, Philadelphia Police Department, Pennsylvania State Police, United States Postal Inspection Service, Multnomah County District Attorney\u2019s Office, and United States Attorney\u2019s Office who worked together to bring justice to the victims and their families.\u201d\n\nAccording to court documents, in just over a year, three Portland residents overdosed on furanyl fentanyl supplied by Koffie, a darknet narcotics vendor known as DNMKingpin and later Narcoboss on AlphaBay. The first victim was a 19-year-old student at Portland State University who, on May 2, 2016, overdosed 30 minutes after ingesting powdered furanyl fentanyl. Paramedics administered Naloxone and breathing assistance to the student, saving her life. Investigators interviewed the student\u2019s source who said he supplied the student with the powdered furanyl fentanyl he purchased from DNMKingpin on AlphaBay.\n\nOne year later, on May 6, 2017, Portland Police Bureau (PPB) officers responded to a fatal overdose of a 27-year-old in southeast Portland. The victim\u2019s roommates told the officers that the victim had ordered fentanyl from Narcoboss on AlphaBay who had advertised the furanyl fentanyl as \u201cChina White.\u201d One roommate further told officers that he and the victim had ordered a gram of fentanyl from Narcoboss for $40 and that it had arrived in a USPS priority mail envelope shipped from Philadelphia.\n\nThree weeks later, on May 29, 2017, PPB officers responded to a fatal overdose of another 27-year-old who had resided in northeast Portland. Officers located a small vial of furanyl fentanyl in the victim\u2019s residence as well as a notebook containing information on accessing AlphaBay and a Bitcoin wallet. They further located an envelope in the victim\u2019s trash can with a return address in Philadelphia.\n\nBetween May 25 and June 21, 2017, investigators conducted five controlled buys of powdered fentanyl from Narcoboss. All five orders were fulfilled from addresses in and around Philadelphia. Around the same time, investigators in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania located and identified Koffie\u2019s fingerprints on packages of furanyl fentanyl resembling those shipped to law enforcement in Portland that were purchased from AlphaBay via Narcoboss.\n\nFurther investigation revealed that between April 6, 2016, and May 23, 2017, Koffie received 14 packages of furanyl fentanyl totaling approximately seven kilograms from distributors in China and Hong Kong. In May and June of 2017, two additional packages shipped to Koffie containing another half kilogram of furanyl fentanyl were intercepted by United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP). It was later determined that Koffie used an online postage company called Stampnik to purchase more than 5,700 postage labels he used to ship furanyl fentanyl throughout the United States, including the labels affixed to parcels seized in Oregon, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania.\n\nOn July 12, 2017, Koffie was charged by criminal complaint in the District of Oregon with distribution of a controlled substance resulting in serious bodily injury or death. Later, on April 21, 2021, he was charged by superseding indictment with conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance, distribution of a controlled substance resulting in serious bodily injury, distribution of a controlled substance resulting in death, and distribution of a controlled substance. The conspiracy charge was dismissed before trial.\n\nKoffie faces a maximum sentence of life in prison, a $10 million fine and three years\u2019 supervised release. He will be sentenced on May 30, 2023, before United States District Court Judge Michael W. Mosman.\n\nKoffie is under federal indictment in two other judicial districts. On August 1, 2017, a federal grand jury in the Western District of Pennsylvania returned an indictmentchargingKoffie with four counts of distributing a controlled substance. On September 20, 2017, a federal grand jury in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania returned a two-count indictment charging Koffie with distributing a controlled substance and distributing a controlled substance within 1,000 feet of a playground. Both cases are pending.\n\nThis case was investigated by HSI, USPIS, and PPB with assistance from the FBI, Oregon-Idaho High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) task force, CBP, Philadelphia Police Department, and Pennsylvania State Police. It was prosecuted by Scott M. Kerin, Parakram Singh, and Andrew T. Ho, Assistant United States Attorneys for the District of Oregon.\n\nOn July 20, 2017, the Justice Department, in partnership with the FBI, United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), HSI and IRS-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI),seized and shut downAlphaBay, which, at the time, was the largest criminal marketplace online. At the time of its seizure, AlphaBay had operated for over two years on the darknet and was used to sell illegal drugs, stolen and fraudulent identification documents and access devices, counterfeit goods, malware and other hacking tools, firearms, and toxic chemicals throughout the world.\n\nIf you or someone you know suffers from addiction, please call the Lines for Life substance abuse helpline at 1-800-923-4357 or visitwww.linesforlife.org.

Brightbill met with personnel at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, including the Deputy Chief of Mission Robert Forden and the Legal Advisor of the Department of Justice to the U.S. Embassy, Richard Daynes. The visit to the Embassy included anevening presentation to the general public at the Beijing American Centerabout ENRD\u2019s robust enforcement of the United States\u2019 environmental and wildlife protection laws. The presentation was followed by a question and answer session with an audience of over 100, including area law students and interested parties. A focus of discussion was recent changes to China\u2019s environmental enforcement laws and public interest litigation practices.\n\nLater that week, Assistant Attorney General Clark and Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brightbill addressed Chinese prosecutors, judges, academics, and other Chinese officials at the National Prosecutors College of China. They discussed the relationship of constitutional law, federalism, and the separation of powers to the practice of environmental law and enforcement in the United States, highlighting the importance of the rule of law. Mr. Clark and Mr. Brightbill also participated in a two-day conference on U.S.-China Watershed Management and Public Interest Litigation, co-sponsored by the U.S.-Asia Partnerships for Environmental Law at Vermont Law School.

            "article_text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 A superseding indictment was returned yesterday in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, charging HuaweiTechnologies Co., Ltd. (Huawei), the world\u2019s largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer, and two U.S. subsidiaries with conspiracy to violate the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).\n\nThe 16-count superseding indictment also adds a charge of conspiracy to steal trade secrets stemming from the China-based company\u2019s alleged long-running practice of using fraud and deception to misappropriate sophisticated technology from U.S. counterparts.\n\nThe indicted defendants include Huawei and four official and unofficial subsidiaries \u2014 Huawei Device Co., Ltd. (Huawei Device), Huawei Device USA Inc. (Huawei USA), Futurewei Technologies, Inc. (Futurewei) and Skycom Tech Co. Ltd. (Skycom) \u2014 as well as Huawei\u2019s Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Wanzhou Meng (Meng).[1]The new superseding indictment also contains the charges from the prior superseding indictment, which was unsealed in January 2019.\n\nRichard P. Donoghue, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York; Brian A. Benczkowski, Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division; John C. Demers, Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division; and Christopher A. Wray, Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), announced the charges.\n\nMr. Donoghue thanked the FBI, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Export Enforcement (OEE) and the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) agents who are investigating this case for their tireless work and dedication.\n\nAs revealed by the government\u2019s independent investigation and review of court filings, the new charges in this case relate to the alleged decades-long efforts by Huawei, and several of its subsidiaries, both in the U.S. and in the People\u2019s Republic of China, to misappropriate intellectual property, including from six U.S. technology companies, in an effort to grow and operate Huawei\u2019s business.\u00a0 The misappropriated intellectual property included trade secret information and copyrighted works, such as source code and user manuals for internet routers, antenna technology and robot testing technology.\u00a0 Huawei, Huawei USA and Futurewei agreed to reinvest the proceeds of this alleged racketeering activity in Huawei\u2019s worldwide business, including in the United States.\n\nThe means and methods of the alleged misappropriation included entering into confidentiality agreements with the owners of the intellectual property and then violating the terms of the agreements by misappropriating the intellectual property for the defendants\u2019 own commercial use, recruiting employees of other companies and directing them to misappropriate their former employers\u2019 intellectual property, and using proxies such as professors working at research institutions to obtain and provide the technology to the defendants.\u00a0 As part of the scheme, Huawei allegedly launched a policy instituting a bonus program to reward employees who obtained confidential information from competitors.\u00a0 The policy made clear that employees who provided valuable information were to be financially rewarded.\n\nHuawei\u2019s efforts to steal trade secrets and other sophisticated U.S. technology were successful.\u00a0 Through the methods of deception described above, the defendants obtained nonpublic intellectual property relating to internet router source code, cellular antenna technology and robotics.\u00a0 As a consequence of its campaign to steal this technology and intellectual property, Huawei was able to drastically cut its research and development costs and associated delays, giving the company a significant and unfair competitive advantage.\n\nWhen confronted with evidence of wrongdoing, the defendants allegedly made repeated misstatements to U.S. officials, including FBI agents and representatives from the U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, regarding their efforts to misappropriate trade secrets.\u00a0 Similarly, the defendants engaged in obstructive conduct to minimize litigation risk and the potential for criminal investigations, including the very investigation that led to this prosecution.\n\nThe superseding indictment also includes new allegations about Huawei and its subsidiaries\u2019 involvement in business and technology projects in countries subject to U.S., E.U. and/or U.N. sanctions, such as Iran and North Korea \u2013 as well as the company\u2019s efforts to conceal the full scope of that involvement.\u00a0 The defendants\u2019 activities, which included arranging for shipment of Huawei goods and services to end users in sanctioned countries, were typically conducted through local affiliates in the sanctioned countries.\u00a0 Reflecting the inherent sensitivity of conducting business in jurisdictions subject to sanctions, internal Huawei documents allegedly referred to such jurisdictions with code names.\u00a0 For example, the code \u201cA2\u201d referred to Iran, and \u201cA9\u201d referred to North Korea.\n\nHuawei employees also allegedly lied about Huawei\u2019s relationship to Skycom, falsely asserting it was not a subsidiary of Huawei.\u00a0 The company further claimed that Huawei had only limited operations in Iran and that Huawei did not violate U.S. or other laws or regulations related to Iran.\u00a0 In fact, the indictment alleges Skycom was Huawei\u2019s unofficial subsidiary that, among other services, assisted the Government of Iran in performing domestic surveillance, including during the demonstrations in Tehran in 2009.\n\nThe charges in the superseding indictment are allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.\n\nThe government\u2019s investigation is ongoing.\u00a0 Individuals with knowledge of misconduct by Huawei, its subsidiaries, employees or agents should contact the FBI\u2019s New York Field Office at 1-800-CALL-FBI.\n\nThe investigation is being jointly conducted by the FBI\u2019s New York Field Office, HSI\u2019s New York Field Office, OEE\u2019s New York Field Office and DCIS\u2019s Southwest and Northeast Field Offices.\u00a0 Agents from the FBI, HSI and OEE offices in Dallas provided significant support and assistance.\u00a0 The government\u2019s case is being handled by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of New York, the Justice Department Criminal Division\u2019s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS) and the Justice Department National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section (CES).\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorneys Alexander A. Solomon, Julia Nestor, David K. Kessler and Sarah Evans, MLARS Trial Attorneys Laura Billings and Christian Nauvel and CES Trial Attorneys Thea D. R. Kendler and David Lim are in charge of the prosecution, with assistance provided by Assistant U.S. Attorney Brendan G. King of the Civil Division of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of New York and Trial Attorneys Margaret O\u2019Malley and John Riesenberg of DOJ\u2019s Office of International Affairs.\u00a0 Additional Criminal Division and National Security Division Trial Attorneys and Assistant U.S. Attorneys within U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices for the Northern District of Texas, the Northern District of Illinois, the Eastern District of Texas, the Western District of Washington and the Northern District of California have provided valuable assistance with various aspects of this investigation.\n\nThe Defendants:\n\nHuaweiTechnologies Co.

            "article_text": "On the two-year anniversary of the Attorney General\u2019s China Initiative, the Department continues its significant focus on the Initiative\u2019s goals and announced substantial progress during the past year in disrupting and deterring the wide range of national security threats posed by the policies and practices of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) government.\n\n\"In the last year, the Department has made incredible strides in countering the systemic efforts by the PRC to enhance its economic and military strength at America\u2019s expense,\" said Attorney General William P. Barr.\u00a0 \"While much work remains to be done, the Department is committed to holding to account those who would steal, or otherwise illicitly obtain, the U.S. intellectual capital that will propel the future.\"\n\n\"The Chinese Communist Party\u2019s theft of sensitive information and technology isn't a rumor or a baseless accusation.\u00a0 It\u2019s very real, and it\u2019s part of a coordinated campaign by the Chinese government, which the China Initiative is helping to disrupt,\" said FBI Director Christopher Wray.\u00a0 \"The FBI opens a new China-related counterintelligence case nearly every 10 hours and we\u2019ll continue our aggressive efforts to counter China\u2019s criminal activity.\"\n\nEstablished in November 2018, the Initiative identified a number of goals for the Department, ranging from increased focus on the investigation and prosecution of trade secret theft and economic espionage, to better countering threats posed by Chinese foreign investment and supply chain vulnerabilities.\n\nPrioritize investigations of economic espionage and trade secret theft\n\nThe Initiative prioritizes use of the Department\u2019s core tool, criminal investigation and prosecution, to counter economic espionage and other forms of trade secret theft.\u00a0 In the past year, the Department charged three economic espionage cases (in which the trade secret theft was intended to benefit the Chinese government), bringing the total to five since the China Initiative was first announced.\u00a0 Overall, since the Initiative was announced, we have charged more than 10 cases in which the trade secret theft had some alleged nexus to China, and we obtained guilty pleas of three defendants in those cases over the past year.\n\nTo take one example, the Department announced the China Initiative on the same day that it unsealed criminal charges against United Microelectronics (UMC), the Chinese state-owned enterprise Fujian Jinhua, and several individual defendants, for economic espionage that victimized Micron Technology, Inc., a leading U.S. semiconductor company.\n\n\"The United Microelectronics case is a glaring example of the PRC\u2019s \u2018rob, replicate, and replace\u2019 strategy, in which it robs a U.S. institution of its intellectual capital, replicates the stolen technology, and then endeavors to replace the U.S. institution on the Chinese and then the global market,\" said John Demers, Assistant Attorney General for National Security.\u00a0 \"Thanks to the dedication and diligence of prosecutors and FBI agents, UMC pleaded guilty to criminal trade secret theft and agreed to pay a fine of $60 million, the second largest fine in a trade secret case, and to cooperate in the pending prosecution of its co-defendants.\"\n\nThe National Counterintelligence Task Force, co-led by the FBI, launched its first major campaign in 2020, devoted to protecting U.S. technology and research from the Chinese government and its proxies.\u00a0 This is a further step in the FBI\u2019s and Department\u2019s efforts to enlist all appropriate partners in ensuring integrity in government-funded programs and defeating economic espionage and theft of trade secrets.\n\nDevelop an enforcement strategy for non-traditional collectors\n\nAt the outset, the Department identified academia as one of our most vulnerable sectors, because its traditions of openness, and the importance of international exchanges to the free flow of ideas, leave it vulnerable to PRC exploitation.\u00a0 The Department has pursued a two-pronged strategy of raising awareness on campuses of the threats posed by China (and the importance of implementing a security program to detect them) and prosecuting researchers who have deliberately deceived authorities about their ties to China, which deprives institutions of the ability to screen for conflicts of interest and commitment, or otherwise exploited their access.\n\nFor example, the PRC has used talent programs to encourage the transfer of technical expertise from the United States, and elsewhere in the world, to benefit the PRC\u2019s economic and military development. \u00a0Talent recruits generally sign contracts with the PRC sponsor-entity that obligate them to produce scientific outputs; to publish the results of their work in the name of the PRC beneficiary; to allow the PRC beneficiary to assert intellectual property rights over their outputs; and to recruit other researchers into the programs, among other obligations.\n\nIn exchange, the talent recruits may receive lucrative compensation packages, prestigious titles, and custom-built laboratories.\n\n\u201cWhile membership in these talent programs is notper seillegal, and the research itself may not always be protected as a trade secret, we know the PRC uses these plans, such as the well-known Thousand Talents Program, as a vehicle to recruit individuals with access to U.S. government-funded research to work in the interest of the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d said Adam S. Hickey, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, National Security Division.\n\nThe Initiative brings together resources from across the Department, including the National Security, Criminal, Tax, and the Civil Divisions to address this unique challenge fairly and effectively.\u00a0 In the past year, Department prosecutors have brought fraud, false statements, tax, smuggling and other charges against ten academics affiliated with research institutions across the country.\u00a0 To date, prosecutors have obtained convictions in three of those cases.\n\nThis year, the FBI and Department prosecutors also exposed six individuals, studying in the United States, found to be connected to People\u2019s Liberation Army military institutes, who concealed their affiliations from the State Department when applying for research visas to study at U.S. universities.\u00a0 In one of those cases, the Department alleged that a PLA officer was being tasked by superiors in the PRC to obtain information that would benefit PLA operations.\u00a0 In another case, a PLA medical researcher stands accused of following orders to observe lab operations at a U.S. university, which received funding from the U.S. government, in order to replicate those operations in the PRC.\n\nIn each of the cases, the defendants are accused of concealing their PLA affiliations in order to obtain visas that allowed them to travel to the United States.\u00a0 After the FBI conducted interviews this summer that led to charges in those cases and the State Department closed the PRC\u2019s Houston Consulate, a large number of undeclared, PLA-affiliated Chinese researchers fled the United States.\n\nThose six examples are just part of the interagency effort to protect academia and taxpayer-funded research.\u00a0 The FBI and Department have been collaborating with federal grant-making agencies, the Joint Committee on the Research Environment, the major academic associations, the Academic Security and Counter Exploitation working group, and other appropriate entities, as well as hundreds of individual universities nationwide.\n\nCounter malicious cyber activity\n\nThe Department continues to expose and disrupt efforts by the PRC government to steal our intellectual property and our personally identifiable information (PII) through computer intrusions.\u00a0 During the past year, we charged hackers working for the People\u2019s Liberation Army with the 2017 Equifax intrusion and others associated with the Ministry of State Security (MSS) in relation to global computer intrusion campaigns targeting biomedical companies conducting COVID-19-related research, engineering firms, and software makers.\u00a0 One such MSS case resulted in the arrest of two conspirators in Malaysia.\u00a0 Two of these cases highlighted China\u2019s development into a safe harbor for criminal hackers who also work for the PRC.\u00a0 The Department disrupted these cyber threats in coordination with the private sector, using legal process to seize control of hacking infrastructure while the private sector removed other infrastructure from their platforms.\n\nIn May, the FBI, in conjunction with the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, also issued a public announcement to raise awareness of the threat to COVID-19 research by PRC-affiliated cyber actors and offer advice on better protecting that research from thefts.\n\nCounter malign foreign influence\n\nThe Department has used the Foreign Agents Registration Act (\u201cFARA\u201d), which requires those acting to influence public policy and opinion on behalf of a foreign individual or entity, to improve transparency and expose China\u2019s foreign influence efforts. \u00a0Over the past year, the Department opened a record number of FARA investigations overall and doubled the number of new registrants and new foreign principals registering annually as of 2016. \u00a0That includes obtaining a record number of registrations from Chinese media companies.\u00a0 The Department also notified a registered Chinese media company that its filings were deficient because they failed to fully disclose its activity in the United States and failed to properly label its informational materials.\u00a0 The media entity remedied those deficiencies shortly thereafter.\n\nThrough its outreach efforts to universities, the Department has highlighted the need to protect foreign students studying in the United States from coercive efforts by the Communist Party to censor the freedom of thought and expression that all students here should enjoy.\n\nIn late 2019, the FBI\u2019s Foreign Influence Task Force formally established a new unit devoted specifically to understanding and defeating the malign foreign influence threat from the Chinese government and its proxies.\n\nCounter foreign intelligence activities\n\nThe Department has achieved a number of successes in the last year in countering China\u2019s foreign intelligence activities.\u00a0 China has been targeting former members of the U.S. intelligence community for recruitment, and the Department has been holding accountable individuals who succumb to their efforts.\u00a0 In November 2019, a former CIA case officer was sentenced to 19 years in prison for conspiring to deliver national defense information to the PRC.\u00a0 In August 2020, another former CIA officer who had been tasked by the PRC was arrested on the same charge \u2014 the fourth former intelligence officer charged in the last three years for similar conduct.\n\nThe Department is particularly focused on disrupting the PRC government from using career networking and social media sites to target Americans, as well as holding those accountable who hide behind fake profiles to co-opt individuals on behalf of the PRC.\u00a0 As one part of this effort, the FBI, in partnership with the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, created an educational film, \"The Nevernight Connection,\" which was released online in September 2020 to educate the public about the Chinese intelligence services\u2019 use of social media to spot and recruit persons of interest, especially current or former security clearance holders.\n\nIn March 2020, Xuehua (Edward) Peng was sentenced to 48 months in prison, and ordered to pay a $30,000 fine, for acting as an agent of the PRC\u2019s Ministry of State Security (MSS) in connection with a scheme to conduct pickups known as \u201cdead drops\u201d and transport Secure Digital cards containing classified information from a source in the United States to the MSS operatives in China.\n\nIn October 2020, Jun Wei Yeo was sentenced to 14 months in prison for acting within the United States as an agent of the MSS recruiting Americans, including U.S. military and government employees with high-level clearances. Yeo concealed his MSS affiliation from his American targets and used career networking sites and a false consulting firm to lure them to write papers which he ultimately passed to his MSS handlers.\n\nIn October 2020, eight defendants were charged with conspiring to act in the United States as illegal agents of the PRC, six of whom also face related charges of conspiring to commit interstate and international stalking.\u00a0 According to the complaint, the defendants participated in an international campaign to threaten, harass, surveil and intimidate a resident of New Jersey and his family in order to force them to return to the PRC as part of an international effort by the PRC government known as \"Operation Fox Hunt\" and \"Operation Skynet.\"\n\nIn furtherance of the operation, the PRC government targets Chinese individuals living in foreign countries that the PRC government alleges have committed crimes under PRC law and seeks to repatriate them to the PRC to face charges, rather than rely upon proper forms of international law enforcement cooperation.\n\nForeign investment reviews and telecommunications security\n\nBeyond criminal enforcement, the Department worked to protect our national assets from national security risks posed by entities, subject to PRC influence, that seek to invest in U.S. companies or integrate into our supply chains.\n\nIn April, the Department assumed the permanent chair of the Committee for the Assessment of Foreign Participation in the United States Telecommunications Services Sector, established by the President through Executive Order (EO), in 2020.\u00a0 This organization, also known as \"Team Telecom,\" is an interagency group that reviews telecommunications, submarine cable landing, wireless, broadcast license, and other applications referred by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), to identify and address risks to national security and law enforcement.\u00a0 In the first 90 days after the Executive Order, the Department led Team Telecom to resolve more than half of the cases then pending review.\n\nTeam Telecom recommended that the FCC revoke and terminate the international telecommunications licenses held by the U.S. subsidiary of a PRC state-owned telecommunications company, China Telecom, the first revocation ever recommended by Team Telecom on national security grounds.\u00a0 Team Telecom also recommended that the FCC partially deny a submarine cable application, to the extent it sought a direct connection between the United States and Hong Kong.\n\nFollowing the President\u2019s 2019 Executive Order on Securing the Information and Communications Technology and Services Supply Chain, the Department has worked with the Commerce Department to develop regulations implementing the EO and has identified vulnerable areas of critical infrastructure that are ripe for investigation under the EO.\n\nThe Department also worked to implement the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA), which improved the authorities of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). \u00a0During the previous year, the Department co-led a record number of significant CFIUS matters, on an annualized basis, including the investigation of the acquisition of a U.S. hotel management software company by a Chinese company, which the President prohibited, for just the sixth time in CFIUS history.\u00a0 Under FIRRMA, the FBI continued to provide analytical assistance to support CFIUS\u2019s decision-making and identify high-risk non-notified transactions.\n\nWith its increased resources, NSD has played a significant role in CFIUS enforcement, leading the Committee to assess just the second penalty in its history, for failing to secure sensitive personal data in violation of a 2018 interim CFIUS order.\u00a0 NSD also dedicated personnel to identify transactions of concern that were not voluntarily filed with CFIUS and developed a program to identify bankruptcy cases that could implicate national security concerns.\u00a0 The bankruptcy program helps to protect U.S. assets from predatory acquisitions, including PRC acquisitions that could impact our national security, which is particularly important in light of the economic impact of COVID-19.\n\nEducation and outreach\n\nThe success of the China Initiative is not measured by criminal cases and administrative actions alone, however.\u00a0 Outreach to businesses and academia is critical to helping America\u2019s national assets better protect themselves. \u00a0For that reason, the Department disseminated outreach presentations for use by U.S. Attorneys in their Districts, which have been deployed at various events.\u00a0 The FBI sustained its engagement with the private sector through various programs, and it developed and disseminated an innovative Academia Field Guide to support focused outreach by its academic outreach coordinators in all 56 field offices.\u00a0 In the coming year, the Department, through the FBI and U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices, will continue to expand our partnerships outside the federal government, because the support of the American people is critical to our success.\u00a0 All of our efforts are on their behalf.\n\nThe Attorney General commends the professionals throughout the Department, including those who work at Main Justice, the FBI, and U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices around the country, who are committed to meeting the goals of the China Initiative and encourage them to redouble their efforts in the upcoming year.\n\nAll defendants, in the cases mentioned herein, are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.",

According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, in 2018, Tao accepted a position with Fuzhou University in China that designated him as a Changjiang Scholar Distinguished Professor. The position\u2019s guidelines required him to be a full-time employee of Fuzhou University.\n\nThe Kansas Board of Regents (KBOR) required faculty to file annual reports to notify of any outside employment that did or could impact duties as a conflict of interest. Tao didn\u2019t seek permission from KU before entering the agreement with Fuzhou University, didn\u2019t notify KU about the employment, and lied to conceal the employment. In December 2018, the defendant moved to China to work full-time at Fuzhou University, while falsely telling KU administrators that he was in Europe.\n\nAs a KU faculty member, Tao conducted research under contracts between the KU and two U.S. government agencies, the Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Science Foundation (NSF). Tao caused KU to submit to DOE and NSF hundreds of thousands of dollars in reimbursement requests for expenditures associated with the grants. Tao repeatedly certified electronic documents indicating he read and understood the federal government and KU\u2019s policies and that he had made all necessary disclosures.\n\nTao faces up to 20 years in federal prison and a fine up to $250,000 for wire fraud, and up to 10 years and a fine up to $250,000 on each of the program fraud counts.\n\nThe FBI investigated the case.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Chris Oakley for the District of Kansas and Trial Attorney Adam Barry of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Controls Section (CES) are prosecuting the case, with valuable assistance provided by Deputy Chief Benjamin Hawk of CES.",

            "article_text": "Andrew M. Luger, United States Attorney for the District of Minnesota and Ed Grace, Deputy Assistant Director for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, announced that today in federal court a St. Cloud State University Professor pleaded guilty to smuggling elephant ivory and to illegally exporting rhinoceros horns from the United States in violation of the Lacey Act. Under the Lacey Act, it is unlawful to import, export, transport, sell or purchase wildlife, fish or plants that were taken, possessed, transported or sold in violation of a state, federal or foreign law. When it was passed in 1900, the Lacey Act became the first federal law protecting wildlife.\n\nYIWEI ZHENG, A/K/A STEVE ZHENG, 43, of St. Cloud, Minnesota, pleaded guilty today in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis to knowingly and fraudulently smuggling elephant ivory out of the United States on April 30, 2011, to a recipient in Shanghai, China, contrary to U.S. smuggling statutes. ZHENG also pleaded guilty to violating the Lacey Act by knowingly exporting two rhinoceros horns from the U.S. between July 25, 2010 and July 27, 2010, with knowledge that the two rhinoceros horns were transported and sold in violation of the laws and regulations of the United States, including the Endangered Species Act.\n\nIn addition to his employment as a Professor of Philosophy at St. Cloud State University, ZHENG operated an online business known asCrouching Dragon Antiques. As part of this business, ZHENG offered for sale and sold a variety of items, including items made of elephant ivory and rhinoceros horn.\n\nAs alleged in court filings and admitted to during the plea hearing today, on May 5, 2011, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers at the International Mail Facility in Chicago, Illinois identified a parcel being exported from the United States and destined for an individual in Shanghai, China. The shipper was identified as YIWEI ZHENG, a Professor at St. Cloud State University in St. Cloud, Minnesota. A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service wildlife inspector determined the package contained a number of elephant ivory carvings. The accompanying Customs Declaration and Dispatch Note completed by the shipper described the contents as \u201cChinese artifact: Desk Decorative item\u201d with a declared value of $35.00. Additionally, the ivory contained within the shipment had not been declared to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service upon export nor had ZHENG obtained any Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) permits for the ivory being exported as required.\n\nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agents determined through investigation that ZHENG purchased the elephant ivory items found in the intercepted shipment through the online auction site eBay and that the value of those items was actually $6,961.41 rather than the $35.00 ZHENG declared on the exported shipment. During the course of the investigation, agents also documented that ZHENG purchased two rhinoceros horns from an individual in Florida for more than $20,000 and subsequently smuggled the two rhinoceros horns out of the United States to China where they were ultimately sold at auction for approximately $68,000. At the time, ZHENG knew that all rhinoceros species were protected under CITES and were listed as endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). ZHENG further knew that the ESA made it unlawful to import or export any endangered wildlife species.\n\nIn total, agents documented that ZHENG smuggled into and out of the United States and sold in China and elsewhere, elephant ivory, rhinoceros horn and products with a fair market value in excess of $1,000,000. Pursuant to the plea agreement presented in U.S. District Court earlier today, ZHENG agreed that the fair market value of the illegal wildlife documented in his case was between $550,000 and $1,500,000.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Laura Provinzino stated \u201cthe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office is committed to protecting the environment and natural resources by prosecuting those individuals who violate our federal laws. Cases like this are important to curb the market for rhinoceros horn and elephant ivory to help ensure the survival of those species across the globe.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is another significant case which documents the extent of global wildlife trafficking and the pressure it places on the world\u2019s most rare and endangered animals,\u201d said U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Deputy Assistant Director for Law Enforcement Ed Grace. \u201cThese types of investigations remain the top priority for us as we carry out the President\u2019s National Strategy for Combating Wildlife Trafficking,\u201d continued Grace.\n\nZHENG faces a maximum sentence of up to 10 years imprisonment and a criminal fine of up to $500,000. The defendant will be sentenced on May 9, 2016 in Minneapolis before Chief Judge John R. Tunheim of the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota.\n\nThis case is the result of an investigation by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Laura M. Provinzino.\n\nThe mission of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is working with others to conserve, protect and enhance fish, wildlife, plants and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people.\n\n\n\n###\n\n\n\nAdditional news available on ourwebsite.\n\nFollow us onTwitterandFacebook.\n\nUnited States Attorney\u2019s Office, District of Minnesota: (612) 664-5600",

            "article_text": "NEWARK, N.J. \u2013 The United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey, Philip Sellinger, announced his resignation today, effective at 11:59 p.m., Jan. 8, 2025.\u00a0 Mr. Sellinger made the following statement regarding his departure and tenure in office:\n\nServing as the United States Attorney has been the honor of a lifetime.\u00a0 My sincere thanks to President Biden for appointing me the temporary steward of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.\u00a0 I leave knowing the storied traditions of this Office will continue through our dedicated career Assistant U.S. Attorneys and staff.\u00a0 Here is just a fraction of their accomplishments over the past three years.\n\nViolent Crime\n\nTargeting New Jersey\u2019s violent street gangs has been a top priority of my administration.\u00a0Building on the Office\u2019s strong tradition in this area, our Violent Crime Initiatives (\u201cVCIs\u201d) in Newark, Jersey City, Camden, and Paterson bring together our federal and local law enforcement partners to identify, investigate and prosecute the perpetrators driving shootings and the lethal drug trade in our communities.\u00a0 Rather than broadly imposing mandatory minimum sentences, we have reserved the most severe sentences for these drivers of violence. This targeted approach has proven extremely effective.\u00a0 Shootings and murders in New Jersey have fallen steadily year over year. \u00a0The total number of shooting victims statewide fell from 1,166 in 2021, to 733 in 2023, and murder victims fell from 250 in 2021, to 190 total in 2023.\u00a0 In 2024, shootings and murders continue to decline.\n\nAnd because our responsibility to protect vulnerable members of the community extends well beyond gang violence, after nearly a decade of skillful appellate advocacy,we obtained significant sentencesfor a husband and wife who inflicted years of devastating abuse on their three young foster children while living at the Picatinny Arsenal and elsewhere.\n\nCivil Rights\n\nI created thefirst standalone Civil Rights Divisionat any U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, bringing civil and criminal AUSAs together to combat hate and protect civil rights, including the alarming rise in hate incidents against our Black, Jewish and Muslim communities.\u00a0We advanced the civil rights of the people of New Jersey in several areas.\n\nWe obtained the hate crime conviction of a man who committeda string of violent assaults\u2014including carjackings\u2014on visibly identifiable members of the Orthodox Jewish community around Lakewood, New Jersey.\u00a0 We obtained the conviction of a man whoadmitted to publishing a manifesto containing threats to attack a synagogue and Jewish people.\u00a0 And wesecured a hate crime convictionagainst a man who admitted to breaking into the Center for Islamic Life at Rutgers University, during the Eid-al-Fitr holiday, where he destroyed religious artifacts. We alsocharged an individual with throwing a Molotov cocktail at a Jewish temple, which charges remain pending.\n\nWe broughtcivil lawsuits to endsystemic racismof communities of color by major banks in and around Newark and New Brunswick, obtaining remedies likely to result in $250 million in loans for the residents of Black, Hispanic, and Asian neighborhoods. Weissued findingsthatNew Jersey Veterans Homesprovided grossly inadequate conditions resulting in some of the highest death rates in the nation during the COVID-19 pandemic and secured a consent decree to protect the constitutional rights of the veterans.\u00a0 And after issuing aFindings Reportregarding systemic violations of Fourth Amendment rights by the Trenton Police Department, we have taken significant steps to end unconstitutional policing in Trenton.\n\nWe alsobrought lawsuitssecuring the right of religious organizations to build temples and mosques in the face of discriminatory zoning policies.\u00a0 And weprotected voting rights for Spanish speakers in Union County, andaccess to the polls for individuals with disabilities in Hudson and Morris Counties.\n\nEconomic Crimes and Government Fraud\n\nMy Office led the investigation into TD Bank\u2019s pervasive failures to prevent money laundering networks from using the bank to move massive sums of illicit funds.\u00a0 Our investigation established that the bank did not monitor 92% of its funds, totaling $18 trillion, for a period of years.\u00a0 This allowed criminal money laundering networks to move over $670 million through the bank. The investigation recently culminated inTD Bank\u2019s landmark guilty pleato violating the Bank Secrecy Act and conspiring to commit money laundering, resulting in over $1.8 billion in criminal penalties.\u00a0 Weprosecuted and obtained convictions of a shadow CEO of a real estate firmfor perpetrating a Ponzi scheme that scammed thousands of victims out of $658 million and anArmy reservist who defrauded and stole from Gold Star families.\u00a0 Weprosecutedseveral othersecurities fraud,insider tradingandmarket manipulationcases.\n\nAnd wechargedthe chief executive officer and a foreperson of a construction company hired by the city of Newark to replace lead pipes, whom we allege intentionally left lead pipes in the ground, endangering public health.\n\nCyber Crime\n\nDuring my administration, our Cybercrime Unit achieved international prominence,leading the investigation of LockBit, then the most prolific and destructive ransomware group in the world.\u00a0LockBit victims included\u00a0hospitals, schools, nonprofit organizations, critical infrastructure facilities, and government and law-enforcement agencies across nearly 120 countries, including Washington D.C.\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department.\u00a0 Before being disrupted through the efforts of our Office and our international partners, LockBit had extracted over $500 million in ransom payments worldwide and caused billions of dollars in broader losses.We charged seven LockBit members, including its leader, and have obtained two convictions to date.\n\nNational Security\n\nOur National Security Unit, working in partnership with the FBI and our state and local partners, has protected New Jersey from domestic and international threats.\n\nWe swiftlycharged a former Marinefor his threats to commit mass shootings targeting white people in New Jersey.\u00a0We successfully prosecuted two individuals for concealing material support to designated foreign terrorist organizationsHamasandHay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS).\u00a0And we alsocharged three Chinese intelligence officers, along with a Chinese national, with conspiracy to act in the United States as agents of China.\u00a0 Among other things, the conspirators allegedly attempted to recruit an individual who was a former federal law enforcement officer and state homeland security official, and was then serving as a professor at an American university.\n\nHealth Care Fraud and Opioid Abuse Prevention and Enforcement\n\nOur Health Care Fraud Unit prosecuted individuals and companies responsible for defrauding government and private health care plans; government contract and customs fraud; unlawful kickback schemes; and fraudulently obtaining millions in federal COVID-19 relief loans.\u00a0 Our Opioid Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Unit aggressively prosecuted the crooked doctors, pharmacies, and sales representatives who put opioids on the street.\n\nCivil Litigation and Asset Recovery\n\nOur Civil Division successfully represented various branches of the United States government in a wide variety of civil and administrative litigation.\u00a0 Quite apart from the $1.8 Billion criminal penalty recovered from TD Bank, for fiscal years 2022,2023and 2024, the District of New Jersey collected a total of over $599 million in criminal and civil debts, including restitution for victims, criminal fines, civil penalties, and in cases the office handled jointly with other U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices and components of the Department of Justice.\n\nOffice Transformation\n\nBecause of\u00a0the office\u2019s demonstrated track record,\u00a0we secured a rare opportunity\u00a0to hire more AUSAs and support staff. \u00a0With over\u00a0165\u00a0AUSAs,\u00a0the\u00a0Office is now\u00a0the largest, and the\u00a0most impactful,\u00a0it has\u00a0ever been. At the same time, building on the office\u2019s longstanding strengths in eLitigation, and U. S. Attorney Sellinger\u2019s role as Chair of the DOJ-wide Elitigation Advisory Council, the office has substantially upgraded its capacity for electronic review of evidence.\n\n****\n\nThe attorneys and staff members of this Office are some of the finest public servants in the country.\u00a0 They work extraordinarily hard, uphold the highest standards of excellence, and ceaselessly pursue the cause of justice.\u00a0 It is their dedication and commitment that has enabled this Office to achieve so much over the past three years.\n\nActing U.S. Attorney\n\nUpon United States Attorney Sellinger\u2019s departure, First Assistant U.S. Attorney Vikas Khanna will become Acting U.S. Attorney.\n\nPending Charges\n\nWith respect to all individuals and entities noted above against whom charges remain pending, the charges and allegations contained in the charging instruments are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\n\n",

            "article_text": "CHICAGO \u2014 A Chinese businesswoman has been indicted in Chicago on federal fraud charges for allegedly providing false verifications of employment for Chinese nationals seeking to stay in the United States on F-1 or H-1B visas.\n\nWEIYUN HUANG, also known as \u201cKelly Huang,\u201d 30, of Beijing, China, is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit visa fraud and five counts of visa fraud, according to an indictment returned Thursday in U.S. District Court in Chicago.\u00a0 Huang has been in federal custody since March after her arrest in the Northern District of California.\u00a0 Arraignment in federal court in Chicago has not yet been scheduled.\n\nThe indictment was announced by John R. Lausch, Jr., United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois; Jeffrey S. Sallet, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Chicago office of the FBI; and James M. Gibbons, Special Agent-in-Charge of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations in Chicago.\u00a0 The government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney Shoba Pillay.\n\nAn F-1 visa permitted a foreign national to study in the United States at a university or other academic institution.\u00a0 An F-1 visa-holder could extend the visa by participating in a program that required the student to obtain temporary employment in their area of study.\u00a0 An H-1B visa permitted U.S.-based employers to temporarily employ foreign nationals in specialty occupations. Foreign nationals with an H-1B visa were permitted to stay in the U.S. for three years, with the possibility of extending their stay to six years.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Huang founded two companies \u2013 FINDREAM LLC and SINOCONTECH LLC \u2013 for the purported purpose of employing foreign nationals in the United States.\u00a0 Huang advertised Findream as a \u201cstartup company in technology services and consulting,\u201d with clients in China and the U.S.\u00a0 Huang used a China-based website, \u201cChinese Looking for Job,\u201d and a China-based WeChat platform, \u201cJob Hunters of North America,\u201d to advertise Findream and Sinocontech to F-1 visa-holders in the U.S. seeking employment and H-1B visas.\n\nIn reality, the companies did not deliver any technology or consulting services nor did they employ any of the individuals who responded to the advertisements, the indictment states.\u00a0 In exchange for a fee, Huang and the companies provided written proof of employment to their customers, knowing that the companies did not actually employ them, the charges allege.\u00a0 Huang, Findream and Sinocontech also provided false offer letters and verification of employment letters as purported evidence of employment, knowing the forms were bogus, the indictment states.\n\nThe fraud scheme allowed at least approximately 2,685 customers to list Findream or Sinocontech as their employer in order to stay in the U.S. on the visas, according to the indictment.\u00a0 Huang and her two companies received at least approximately $2 million from customers for whom they agreed to falsely certify employment, the indictment states.\n\nFindream, which was incorporated in California, and Sinocontech, which was incorporated in Delaware, are also charged in the indictment.\u00a0 Findream is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit visa fraud and four counts of visa fraud, while Sinocontech is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit visa fraud and one count of visa fraud.\n\nThe public is reminded that an indictment contains only charges and is not evidence of guilt.\u00a0 The defendants are presumed innocent and entitled to a fair trial at which the government has the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u00a0 Each count of visa fraud is punishable by up to ten years in prison, while the conspiracy count carries a maximum sentence of five years.",

            "article_text": "WASHINGTON - The world\u2019s largest dietary supplement retailer, GNC Holdings Inc. (GNC), has entered into a wide-ranging agreement with the Department of Justice to reform its practices related to potentially unlawful dietary ingredients and dietary supplements, and has further promised to embark on a series of voluntary initiatives designed to improve the quality and purity of dietary supplements, the Department of Justice announced today.\u00a0 The non-prosecution agreement resolves GNC\u2019s liability for selling certain dietary supplements produced by a firm currently under indictment.\u00a0 As part of the agreement, GNC has agreed to pay $2.25 million to the U.S. government and cooperate in dietary supplement investigations conducted by the government.\n\nA lengthy investigation conducted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Texas, and the Consumer Protection Branch of the Department of Justice\u2019s Civil Division revealed that GNC\u2019s practices related to ensuring the legality of products on its shelves were lacking.\n\nAccording to an agreed-upon statement of facts that accompanies the non-prosecution agreement, GNC engaged in acts and omissions that allowed a misbranded supplement\u2014 OxyElite Pro Advanced Formula, a product of Dallas-based USPlabs LLC (USP Labs)\u2014to be sold at GNC locations nationwide in 2013.\u00a0 The statement of facts notes that GNC sold the product based on representations from USP Labs that ingredients contained in the product complied with the law.\u00a0 It further notes that GNC did not undertake additional testing or require additional certifications to confirm such representations or to verify that the ingredients in the product were as represented.\n\nUSP Labs wasindictedin November 2015 and is awaiting trial.\u00a0 The indictment alleges, among other things, that USP Labs engaged in a conspiracy to import ingredients from China using false certificates of analysis and false labeling, and then lied about the source and nature of those ingredients after it put them in its products.\u00a0 According to the indictment, USP Labs told some of its retailers and wholesalers that it used natural plant extracts in some of its products, when in fact it was using synthetic stimulants manufactured in a Chinese chemical factory.\n\nToday\u2019s resolution requires GNC to commit to certain changes designed to prevent unlawful dietary supplements from reaching its shelves:\n\n\n\n\u201cUnlawful dietary supplements are an important enforcement priority for the department,\u201d said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Benjamin C. Mizer, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division. \u201cToday\u2019s resolution is a significant step forward in reforming an industry rife with alarming practices. Companies like GNC need to do more to ensure that they are not selling products containing questionable and untested ingredients.\u00a0 The American public deserves better, and the Department of Justice appreciates GNC\u2019s efforts in resolving its issues and moving forward in the best interests of American consumers.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am pleased with this agreement and hold steadfast that those engaged in the sale of dietary supplements to the public must adhere to higher standards to ensure consumers are protected from lax business practices that could endanger them,\u201d said U.S. Attorney John R. Parker of the Northern District of Texas.\n\n\u201cProtecting the public from unsafe ingredients in dietary supplements is one of FDA\u2019s most important responsibilities,\u201d said Director George M. Karavetsos of FDA Office of Criminal Investigations. \u201cWe will continue to work with industry to ensure that supplements distributed in the U.S. marketplace do not contain harmful ingredients.\u201d\n\nThe matter was handled by Consumer Protection Branch Trial Attorneys David Sullivan and Patrick Runkle, and Northern District of Texas Assistant U.S. Attorney Errin Martin.\u00a0 FDA Office of Chief Counsel Attorneys Nathan Sabel and Michael Shane supported the matter, which was investigated by the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, Dallas Domicile.\n\nToday\u2019s action is part of the government\u2019s efforts, in collaboration with the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences\u2019 Consortium for Health and Military Performance (CHAMP), to provide educational resources for service members and the general public to protect them from risky dietary supplements.\u00a0Through its Operation Supplement Safety (OPSS), and in partnership with the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) and Supplement 411, OPSS provides important information to service members and consumers about dietary supplements.\u00a0 In 2015, OPSS launched a High-Risk Supplement List mobile application (accessible on iOS and Android). For more information, consult theOPSS website. To access the educational resources USADA provides for athletes and general consumers to help realize, recognize and reduce the risks associated with using supplement products, visit USADA\u2019s website athttp://www.supplement411.org.\n\nFor more information about the Consumer Protection Branch and its enforcement efforts, visit its website athttp://www.justice.gov/civil/consumer-protection-branch.\u00a0\u00a0 For more information about the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Texas, visit its website athttps://www.justice.gov/usao-ndtx.\n\n\n\n# # #",

            "article_text": "UPDATE\n\nThe government dismissed all charges alleged in the indictment described in the press release below.\n\nFour individuals have recently been charged with visa fraud in connection with a scheme to lie about their status as members of the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s military forces, the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA), while in the United States conducting research.\u00a0 Three of these individuals have been arrested and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is seeking the fourth who is a fugitive from justice currently being harbored at the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco.\n\nIn addition to these arrests, the FBI has recently conducted additional interviews of visa holders suspected of having undeclared affiliation with the Chinese military in more than 25 American cities.\n\n\u201cThese members of China\u2019s People Liberation Army applied for research visas while hiding their true affiliation with the PLA,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers.\u00a0 \u201cThis is another part of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s plan to take advantage of our open society and exploit academic institutions.\u00a0 We will continue to conduct this investigation together with the FBI.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States welcomes students, academics, and researchers from across the globe. Today\u2019s announcement shows the extreme lengths to which the Chinese government has gone to infiltrate and exploit America\u2019s benevolence,\" said John Brown, Executive Assistant Director of the FBI's National Security Branch. \u201cIn interviews with members of the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army in over 25 cities across the U.S., the FBI uncovered a concerted effort to hide their true affiliation to take advantage of the United States and the American people.\u201d\n\nEach defendant has been charged with visa fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01546(a).\u00a0 If convicted, each faces a maximum statutory penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.\u00a0 The allegations against each are as follows:\n\nXin WANG\n\nAccording to a complaint that was unsealed in the Northern District of California, on June 8, 2020 and court documents filed June 11, Wang entered the United States on March 26, 2019, after receiving a J1 non-immigrant visa in December of 2018.\u00a0 Wang\u2019s visa application stated that the purpose of his visit was to conduct scientific research at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).\u00a0 Wang is alleged to have made fraudulent statements on this visa application.\u00a0 Specifically, Wang stated that he had served as an Associate Professor in Medicine in the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA), from September 1, 2002 through September 1, 2016.\n\nIn reality, when interviewed by officers of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at LAX on June 7, Wang provided information that he was, in fact, still currently a \u201cLevel 9\u201d technician in the PLA, employed by a military university lab.\u00a0 CBP officers also obtained information that this roughly corresponded with the rank of Major.\u00a0 According to court documents, Wang was still employed by the PLA while he was studying in the United States, and he made false statements about his military service in his visa application in order to increase the likelihood that he would receive his J1 visa.\n\nAlso according to court documents, Wang provided information to CBP that he had been instructed by his supervisor, the director of his military university lab in the PRC, to observe the layout of the UCSF lab and bring back information on how to replicate it in China.\u00a0 Wang similarly told his supervising UCSF professor that he had duplicated some of the work of that professor at the lab in China.\u00a0 Some of the work of the UCSF lab was funded by grants from the United States Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nWang was arrested on June 7, and had his initial appearance on June 8.\u00a0 A grand jury in the Northern District of California returned an indictment on June 22.\n\nJuan TANG\n\nAccording to court documents unsealed in the Eastern District of California on July 20, Tang, a researcher at the University of California at Davis, applied for a non-immigrant J1 visa on or about Oct. 28, 2019.\u00a0 The visa was issued in November 2019, and Tang entered the United States on or about Dec. 27, 2019.\u00a0 Tang is alleged to have made fraudulent statements on her visa application.\u00a0 Specifically, to the question, \u201cHave you ever served in the military,\u201d Tang responded \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Tang is a uniformed officer of the PLA Air Force (PLAAF).\u00a0 As set forth in the Complaint, the FBI found a photograph of Tang in a military uniform and references to Tang\u2019s employment at the Air Force Military Medical University, which has also been known as the Fourth Military Medical University.\u00a0 The FBI interviewed Tang on June 20.\u00a0 Although Tang denied having been a member of the military, an additional photograph of Tang in a different PLA military uniform was found on electronic media seized pursuant to a search warrant.\n\nThe FBI is seeking to arrest Tang pursuant to an Arrest Warrant and Complaint that were filed on June 26, and unsealed on July 20.\u00a0 Tang has sought refuge at the Chinese consulate in San Francisco, where she remains.\n\nChen SONG\n\nThe allegations describing the crime appear in an affidavit supporting the complaint filed on July 17 and unsealed in the Northern District of California on July 20.\u00a0 According to the affidavit, Song, 38, a Chinese national, applied for a J1 nonimmigrant visa in November 2018.\u00a0 She entered the United States on Dec. 23, 2018.\u00a0 In her visa application, in response to the question, \u201cHave you ever served in the military,\u201d Song stated that she had served in the Chinese military only from Sept. 1, through June 30, 2011.\u00a0 She further stated that her employer was \u201cXi Diaoyutai Hospital.\u201d Song described herself in her visa application as a neurologist who was coming to the U.S. to conduct research at Stanford University related to brain disease.\n\nThe affidavit alleges that these were lies, that Song was a member of the PLA when she entered and while she was in the United States, and that the hospital she listed on her visa as her employer was a cover for her true employer, the PLA.\u00a0 The affidavit identifies four research articles that she co-authored, which described her as affiliated with institutions subordinate to the PLA Air Force.\u00a0 Specifically, the articles list Song as affiliated with the Air Force General Hospital in Beijing and the Fourth Military Medical University.\u00a0 In addition, as of July 13, a Chinese health care website listed Song as an attending physician of the Department of Neurology of the PLA Air Force General Hospital, and included a photograph of Song wearing what appears to be a military uniform.\u00a0 Further, an article published in 2015 identifies Song as the doctor at the PLA Air Force hospital who performed the autopsy on the former chief physician of the MRI Department at the hospital.\n\nFinally, according to the affidavit, a search of Song\u2019s external hard drive, recovered pursuant to a court-authorized search warrant, found that, on June 21, Song had deleted a folder titled, in Chinese, \u201c2018 Visiting School Important Information.\u201d\u00a0 The search recovered deleted documents from this folder.\u00a0 The affidavit alleges that one of the recovered documents was a letter from Song to the Chinese Consulate in New York, explaining that she was extending her time in the United States for another year, and wrote that her stated employer, Beijing Xi Diaoyutai Hospital, is a false front, which is why she had obtained approval for her extension from the PLA Air Force and FMMU.\u00a0 The letter further allegedly explained that, as these Chinese military approval documents were classified, she could not transmit them online.\n\nSong was arrested on July 18.\n\nKaikai ZHAO\n\nAccording to a complaint filed in the Southern District of Indiana on July 17 and unsealed today, Zhao, a graduate student studying machine learning and artificial intelligence at Indiana University, applied for an F1 nonimmigrant visa in June 2018.\u00a0 In response to the question on the visa application, \u201cHave you ever served in the military,\u201d Zhao answered, \u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0 As set forth in the Complaint, Zhao served in the National University of Defense Technology, the PLA\u2019s premier institution for scientific research and education, which is directly subordinate to the PRC\u2019s Central Military Commission.\u00a0 Zhao also attended the Aviation University of Air Force (AUAF), which is a Chinese military academy analogous to the U.S. Air Force Academy.\u00a0 AUAF students are active military service members who receive military training.\u00a0 In addition, the FBI located an online photograph of Zhao wearing a PLAAF uniform.\n\nZhao was arrested on July 18.",

            "article_text": "United States Attorney Erica H. MacDonald today announced a federal indictment against AARON RHY BROUSSARD, 28, charging him with twenty-one counts related to the distribution of controlled substances, including fentanyl, which resulted in the deaths of eleven people and caused serious bodily injury to four people.BROUSSARD will be arraigned on these charges before a Magistrate Judge in U.S. District Court at a later date. On December 6, 2016, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania indicted BROUSSARD on one count of distribution and possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance and he is scheduled to stand trial on those charges on May 14, 2019. BROUSSARD was arrested on December 7, 2016, and is in custody in Scranton, Pennsylvania.\n\nAccording to the allegations in the indictment, from 2014 through December 6, 2016, BROUSSARD obtained controlled substances, including fentanyl, from China-based drug suppliers. Upon receipt, BROUSSARD repackaged the controlled substances, marketed them for sale, and sold them to customers in the United States. BROUSSARD used various websites to market the controlled substances including PlantFoodUSA.Net, and distributed the controlled substances to customers using the United States mail and a United States Postal Service \u201cClick-N-Ship\u201d account.\n\nAccording to the allegations in the indictment, on March 12, 2016, BROUSSARD placed a drug order for 100 grams of 4-FA, a controlled substance, which was shipped from China and contained approximately 100 grams of fentanyl. Between April 1 and April 27, 2016, BROUSSARD sent packages containing fentanyl to multiple customers throughout the United States. After ingesting the controlled substance received from BROUSSARD, eleven of the customers died from a fentanyl overdose and four customers suffered serious bodily injury. BROUSSARD continued to distribute controlled substances to customers even after learning that some had overdosed.\n\nThis case is the result of an investigation conducted by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the University of Minnesota Police Department, the Peoria Heights (Illinois) Police Department, the Hazel Green (Wisconsin) Police Department, the Dallas (Texas) Police Department, the Broome County (New York) Sheriff\u2019s Office, the Velusia County (Florida) Sheriff\u2019s Office, the Orange County (California) Sheriff\u2019s Office, and the Atlanta (Georgia) Police Department.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Thomas M.

            "article_text": "\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio \u2013 A rheumatology professor and researcher with strong ties to China pleaded guilty to making false statements to federal authorities as part of an immunology research fraud scheme.\n\nSong Guo Zheng, 58, of Hilliard, appeared in federal court today, at which time his guilty plea was accepted by Chief U.S. District Judge Algenon L. Marbley.\n\nAs part of his plea, Zheng admitted he lied on applications in order to use approximately $4.1 million in grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to develop China\u2019s expertise in the areas of rheumatology and immunology.\n\nZheng was a professor of internal medicine who led a team conducting autoimmune research at The Ohio State University and Pennsylvania State University. According to his plea, Zheng caused materially false and misleading statements on NIH grant applications, seeking to hide his participation in Chinese Talent Plans and his affiliation and collaboration with a Chinese university controlled by the Chinese government. Making false statements to the federal government is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison.\n\nZheng was arrested Friday, May 22, 2020, after he arrived in Anchorage, Alaska, aboard a charter flight and as he prepared to board another charter flight to China.\u00a0When he was arrested, he was carrying three large bags, one small suitcase and a briefcase containing two laptops, three cell phones, several USB drives, several silver bars, expired Chinese passports for his family, deeds for property in China and other items.\n\nHe was transported to the Southern District of Ohio and made his first federal court appearance in Columbus on July 7, 2020.\n\n\u201cFederal research funding is provided by the American tax payers for the benefit of American society\u2014not as a subsidy for the Chinese Government,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers.\u00a0\u201cThe American people deserve total transparency when federal dollars are being provided for research, and we will continue to hold accountable those who choose to lie about their foreign government affiliations in an attempt to fraudulently gain access to these funds.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe FBI and its partners are a unified front in protecting taxpayer-funded research, so there is no escape for those who break America\u2019s laws. Whether it\u2019s a midnight flight through Alaska or hiding in plain sight, we will find you and bring you to justice,\u201d stated Alan E. Kohler, Jr., Assistant Director of the FBI's Counterintelligence Division.\n\n\u201cZheng promised China he would enhance the country\u2019s biomedical research. He was preparing to flee the United States after he learned that his American employer had begun an administrative process into whether or not he was complying with American taxpayer-funded grant rules,\u201d said David M. DeVillers, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio.\u00a0\u201cToday\u2019s plea reinforces our proven commitment to protect our country\u2019s position as a global leader in research and innovation, and to punish those who try to exploit and undermine that position.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe FBI and our law enforcement partners continue to engage with universities to protect sensitive research from being illegally transferred to foreign governments,\u201d stated FBI Cincinnati Special Agent in Charge Chris Hoffman. \u201cToday's plea represents an acknowledgement by Zheng not only of his violation of the trust given to him by the U.S. government in the form of federal grant funds, but also of norms for research integrity and an abuse of the openness and transparency in the U.S. academic system.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe purpose of reporting potential conflicts of interest is to protect the integrity of professional judgement and ensure the public\u2019s trust in the research being conducted,\u201d said Lamont Pugh III, Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, Office of Inspector General \u2013 Chicago Region. \u201cThis defendant violated that trust by failing to report his financial interests and affiliations with foreign parties in an effort to improperly obtain research grant funding through the National Institutes of Health. The OIG is committed to identifying and investigating instances where individuals intentionally fail to report or falsify information regarding their sources of research support in order to ensure the proper use of taxpayer dollars.\u201d\n\nAccording to court documents, since 2013, Zheng had been participating in a Chinese Talent Plan, a program established by the Chinese government to recruit individuals with knowledge or access to foreign technology intellectual property.\u00a0Since that time, Zheng used research conducted in the United States to benefit the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u00a0Zheng failed to disclose conflicts of interest or his foreign commitments to his American employers or to the NIH.\n\nIn announcing the plea, U.S. Attorney DeVillers acknowledged the assistance of the Anchorage FBI Division who arrested Zheng, interviewed him and executed multiple warrants while he was detained, and the assistance provided by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Alaska. This case was investigated by the FBI and Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General.\u00a0Assistant United States Attorneys Douglas W. Squires and S. Courter Shimeall, Special Assistant United States Attorney Christopher N. St. Pierre, and Trial Attorney Matthew J. McKenzie with the Department of Justice\u2019s National Security Division are representing the United States in this case.\n\n# # #",

            "article_text": "TRENTON, N.J. \u2013 A federal indictment was unsealed today charging four Chinese nationals, including three Ministry of State Security (MSS) intelligence officers, in connection with a long-running intelligence campaign targeting individuals in the United States to act as agents of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger and National Security Division Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen announced.\n\nAs alleged in the indictment, from at least 2008 to 2018, Wang Lin, Bi Hongwei, Dong Ting, aka Chelsea Dong, Wang Qiang, and others engaged in a wide-ranging and systematic effort to target and recruit individuals to act on behalf of the PRC in the United States with requests to provide information, materials, equipment, and assistance to the Chinese government in ways that would further China\u2019s intelligence objectives. These recruitment efforts included targeting professors at universities, a former federal law enforcement and state homeland security official, and others to act on behalf of, and as agents of, the Chinese government.\n\nAs part of the conspiracy, MSS intelligence officers Wang Lin, Dong Ting, and others used a purported academic institute at Ocean University of China \u2013 referred to as the Institute for International Studies (IIS) \u2013 as cover for their clandestine intelligence activities. Acting under cover as the purported director of the IIS, Wang Lin, in coordination with other MSS operatives operating under the guise of academics at the IIS, targeted professors at American universities and others in the United States with access to sensitive information and equipment.\n\n\u201cThis indictment drives home the fact that the intelligence risk posed by MSS continues to be real, ever-present, and significant,\u201d U.S. Attorney Sellinger said. \u201cEveryone in the United States \u2013 and especially those in academic, business, military, or government positions that have access to sensitive information or equipment \u2013 should take heed of the risk that the MSS poses to our democracy and way of life.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese defendants cloaked themselves and their motives in order to get access to our higher learning institutions and recruit others to betray this nation. All intended to give China a leg up,\u201d\u00a0Special Agent in Charge James Dennehy said.\u00a0\u201cThe FBI would never let that happen.\u00a0The safety of the citizens of the United States and the security of our nation are our top priorities. When foreign adversaries threaten either of those two things \u2013 whether on our soil or from another country; whether in-person or through\u00a0cyber channels\u00a0\u2013 we will use every resource at our disposal to uncover their\u00a0espionage,\u00a0thwart their\u00a0malign influence, and bring them to justice.\u201d\n\nAccording to the indictment unsealed today:\n\nThe threat posed by the PRC\u2019s ongoing, wide-ranging, and systematic effort to collect intelligence information from United States sources is significant and ongoing. China\u2019s civilian intelligence agency, the MSS, is responsible for conducting counterintelligence and foreign intelligence activities, as well as political security for the PRC. The MSS and its regional bureaus focus on identifying and influencing the foreign policy of other countries, including the United States, by seeking to obtain information on political, economic, and security policies that might affect the PRC, along with military, scientific, and technical information of value to the PRC. The MSS and its regional bureaus are tasked with conducting clandestine and covert human source operations, of which the United States was and remains a principal target. Chinese intelligence services, including the MSS, utilize a variety of state ministries, societies, academic institutions, and the Chinese military-industrial complex to support intelligence activities, including by providing cover jobs to operatives. The investigation revealed that the defendants used one such purported academic institution \u2013 the IIS \u2013 as cover for their intelligence activities for the MSS.\n\nMSS intelligence officers Wang Lin, Bi, Dong, and others, acting for and on behalf of the MSS and the Chinese government, systematically targeted United States persons, including but not limited to a coconspirator who was a resident of the state of New Jersey and a second individual who was a former federal law enforcement officer and state homeland security official and a professor at an American university.\n\nAmong other things, the conspiracy targeted the second individual by inviting the individual in 2008 and 2018 on all-expenses-paid trips to China sponsored by the IIS. During those trips, Wang Lin, Dong, and others sought to recruit this individual as a human source, requesting that the individual provide sensitive fingerprint technology, information, and assistance with stopping planned protests along the 2008 Olympic Games torch route in the United States, which the conspirators expressed would be \u201cembarrassing\u201d to China. The individual also was requested to sign a contract for purported consulting services with a Chinese company whose \u201ccore value\u201d was the \u201cnational interest and national security\u201d of China, with an objective to \u201cprotect the national interest and Chinese enterprises\u2019 overseas interest[s]\u201d and to \u201cbuild sources and channels to collect security information.\u201d Recognizing Wang Lin, Dong, and others as Chinese intelligence officers, the individual refused these requests and reported them to law enforcement.\n\nThe conspiracy also targeted the coconspirator in New Jersey by tasking the coconspirator to take specific action in the United States in furtherance of the MSS\u2019 intelligence objective. Wang Qiang coordinated a meeting in 2016 between the coconspirator, Wang Lin, and Bi Hongwei in the Bahamas, at which time MSS intelligence officers Wang Lin and Bi directed the coconspirator to obtain United States currency and provide it to a designated individual in New Jersey. The coconspirator returned to New Jersey and did as Wang\u00a0Lin and Bi instructed. Wang Qiang then visited the coconspirator in New\u00a0Jersey, at which time Wang Qiang and the coconspirator discussed in detail their and others\u2019 activities taken on behalf of the Chinese government in the United States.\n\nWang Lin, 59, Bi, age unknown, Dong 40, and Wang Qiang, 55, all are nationals and residents of the People\u2019s Republic of China. They each are charged in the indictment with conspiracy to act in the United States as agents of a foreign government, namely, the People\u2019s Republic of China, without prior notification to the Attorney General of the United States, as\u00a0required by law, and to direct such unlawful action by others in the United States. The conspiracy charge carries a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of five\u00a0years and a maximum fine of $250,000.\n\nU.S. Attorney Sellinger credited special agents of the FBI, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge James E. Dennehy in Newark, with the investigation leading to the charges.\n\nThe government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorneys J. Brendan Day, Attorney-in-Charge of the Trenton Branch Office, Joyce M. Malliet, Chief of the Office\u2019s National Security Unit, and Trial Attorney David C. Recker of the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section of the National Security Division.\n\nThe charges and allegations contained in the indictment are merely accusations and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.",

Kelly to one count of conspiracy to use false, forged, and counterfeited documents, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0371, in connection with a scheme where Chinese nationals fraudulently obtained student visas by hiring people with fake Chinese passports to take an English proficiency test in their names.\n\nThe United States requires foreign citizens who wish to enter the United States on a temporary basis to study at a college or university to first obtain an F-1 student visa. To obtain a student visa, foreign citizens must first apply to study at a school that has been authorized by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) to enroll foreign students. In the United States, many SEVP-certified schools require foreign citizens whose first language is not English to certify proficiency in English by achieving a particular score on the TOEFL or other English proficiency examination.\n\nWhen the foreign national goes to a TOEFL testing location, the test taker must present an original, non-expired, government-issued identification document recognized by their home country. As described in the indictment and the plea agreement, the defendants conspired to use counterfeit People\u2019s Republic of China passports and national identification cards to impersonate at least 50 different Chinese nationals at various TOEFL testing locations internationally, including in the District of Columbia.\n\nThe announcement was made by Acting U.S. Attorney Michael R. Sherwin for the District of Columbia, and Special Agent in Charge Raymond Villanueva of the HSI Washington Field Office.\n\nThe charge of conspiracy to use false, forged, and counterfeited documents carries a statutory maximum penalty of five years in prison. Sentencing has been scheduled before the Honorable Timothy J. Kelly on December 11, 2020.\n\nThis case was investigated by Homeland Security Investigations\u2019 Washington Field Office, with assistance from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service\u2019s Fraud Detection National Security Section and the U.S. Treasury Office of the Inspector General. The Educational Testing Service, which administers the TOEFL exam, has also provided assistance during the investigation.\n\nThis matter is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Jessi Camille Brooks of the National Security Section, with assistance from Paralegal Specialist Jorge Casillas.\u00a0 Special thanks go to former Assistant United States Attorney Jeff Pearlman and former Special Assistant United States Attorney Elizabeth Dewar.",

A fourth school in Alhambra \u2013 Likie Fashion and Technology College \u2013 was also involved in the scheme, which ran for at least six years.\n\nProdee and the other schools issued immigration documents to foreign nationals who were not bona fide students, had no intention of attending the schools, and sometimes lived outside of California. As part of the conspiracy, Shim created bogus student records, including transcripts, for some of the students for the purpose of deceiving immigration authorities. In exchange for the immigration documents that allowed them to remain in the United States, the purported \u201cstudents\u201d made \u201ctuition\u201d payments to Shim and his co-conspirators to \u201cenroll\u201d and remain enrolled at the schools.\n\n\u201cImmigration fraud schemes such as this allow foreign nationals to circumvent immigration controls and enter, as well as remain in, the United States unlawfully, which compromises national security and the strict set of rules that legitimate immigrants follow,\u201d said United States Attorney Eileen M. Decker. \u201cThese defendants not only undermined the immigration system, but they did a disservice to all of the immigrants following the rules for entry into the U.S.\u201d\n\nTwo other defendants named in the 2015 indictment \u2013 Hyung Chan Moon (also known as Steve Moon), 40, of Los Angeles, and Eun Young Choi (also known as Jamie Choi), 37, of Los Angeles \u2013 previously pleaded guilty and are pending sentencing.\n\nThe investigation in this case began in 2011 after a compliance team with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), Student and Exchange Visitor Program, paid an unannounced visit to Prodee University\u2019s main campus on Wilshire Boulevard. During the visit, the team observed only one English language class with three students in attendance, even though records indicated more than 900 foreign students were enrolled at Prodee\u2019s two campuses. That same day, an unannounced visit to ACFS found only one religion class in session with a single student present, even though the school had more than 300 foreign students in active status.\n\nDuring the ensuing investigation, HSI special agents identified several dozen foreign nationals, primarily from South Korea and China, who originally entered the U.S. as F-1 non-immigrant students to attend other schools, but subsequently transferred to schools in the Prodee network. These students lived across the nation, indicating that they were not actually attending classes at Prodee or the other schools.\n\nAs detailed in court filings, Prodee and its affiliated schools were authorized to issue a document that certified a foreign national had been accepted to a school and would be a full-time student. The document \u2013 \u201cCertificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant (F-1) Student Status - for Academic and Language Students,\u201d which is commonly called a Form I-20 \u2013 made a student eligible to obtain an F-1 student visa that would allow the student to enter and remain in the United States while the student was making normal progress toward completing a full course of study.\n\n\u201cAs defendant and his co-conspirators knew, these Form I-20s were based on false claims, false statements, and fraud since the purported foreign students had no intention of attending school and were not bona fide students,\u201d according to Shim\u2019s plea agreement.\n\n\u201cStudent visas are intended to afford people from around the world an opportunity come to this country to enrich themselves with the vast learning opportunities available here, but this defendant was interested in a different kind of enrichment, his own,\u201d said Joseph Macias, special agent in charge for HSI Los Angeles. \u201cHSI will move aggressively against those who compromise the integrity of our nation's visa system and put America's security at risk in the process. As this defendant learned, those who abuse the generosity of our foreign student visa program can expect a lesson in criminal justice.\"\n\nAs a result of today\u2019s guilty pleas, Shim faces a statutory maximum penalty of 15 years in federal prison. He is scheduled to be sentenced by United States District Judge George H. Wu on June 5.\n\nIn his plea agreement, Shim agreed to forfeit to the United States approximately $465,000 in bank funds and cash that were seized by investigators in 2015.\n\nThe investigation into the Prodee schools was conducted by HSI, which received substantial assistance from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\u2019 Fraud Detection and National Security Division.\n\nThis case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Wilson Park of the Violent and Organized Crime Section, Lindsey Greer Dotson of the Public Corruption and Civil Rights Section, and Katie Schonbachler of the Asset Forfeiture Section.",

            "article_text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Teang Liu, 38, of Alexandria, Virginia, a citizen of the People\u2019s Republic of China, was sentenced today to 12 months and a day in prison for participating in a conspiracy to defraud Apple Inc. out of more than $1 million.\n\nThe announcement was made by U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves, Raymond Villanueva, Special Agent in Charge, Washington, D.C. Field Office, Department of Homeland Security, Homeland Security Investigations, and Greg Torbenson, U.S. Postal Inspector in Charge for the Washington Division, U.S. Postal Inspection Service.\n\nLiu pleaded guilty in February 2021, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud. In addition to the prison term, the Honorable Emmet G. Sullivan ordered Liu to pay $577,780 in restitution and $57,780 in a forfeiture money judgment. Followning his prison term, Liu will be placed on a year of supervised release.\n\nLiu moved to the United States in 2011. In 2014, he obtained his master\u2019s degree in finance from George Washington University. From at least June 2016 to at least June 2018, he actively participated in a conspiracy to defraud Apple.\u00a0 Liu was recruited to join the conspiracy by Haiteng Wu. Wu also recruited Jiahong Cai, Wu\u2019s wife, to participate in the scheme. Like Liu, Wu and Cai are citizens of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nAs part of the scheme, conspirators received shipments of inauthentic iPhones from Hong Kong. Those phones contained spoofed IMEI numbers and serial numbers that corresponded with authentic in-warranty iPhones. The conspirators then returned the inauthentic phones to Apple, claiming that the phones were legitimate, in-warranty phones, all in an effort to receive authentic replacement iPhones from Apple. The fraudulently obtained authentic iPhones were then shipped back to conspirators overseas, including in Hong Kong.\n\nLiu\u2019s particular role in the conspiracy included opening dozens of commercial mail agency mailboxes -- mostly at UPS Stores -- using fake identification cards that Wu provided to him, returning fraudulent phones to Apple retail stores, and traveling to the Rocky Mountains and Florida to facilitate the fraud.\n\nThe conspirators acknowledged successfully defrauding Apple out of nearly $1 million and intending to defraud the company out of even more money.\n\nWu, Cai, and Liu were arrested in December 2019. Wu and Cai were detained from the time of their arrests to their sentencings. Each pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud in May 2020. Cai ultimately ended up spending five months at a D.C. jail as part of her sentence. She also was ordered removed from the United States. Wu was sentenced on Feb. 1, 2021, to time served, approximately 26 months that he spent in custody.\n\nThis case was investigated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Homeland Security Investigations, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. It was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Kondi Kleinman of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia\u2019s Fraud, Public Corruption, and Civil Rights Section, and Senior Counsel Ryan K.J. Dickey of the Justice Department\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section.

            "article_text": "CHICAGO \u2014 A Chinese businesswoman was sentenced today to 37 months in federal prison for conspiracy to commit visa fraud.\n\nWEIYUN HUANG, also known as \u201cKelly Huang,\u201d 30, of Beijing, China, provided false verifications of employment for foreign nationals seeking to stay in the United States on F-1 or H-1B visas.\u00a0 Huang previously pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit visa fraud. U.S. District Court Judge Thomas M. Durkin on Friday imposed the prison sentence in federal court in Chicago.\n\nThe sentence was announced by John R. Lausch, Jr., United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois; Emmerson Buie, Jr., Special Agent-in-Charge of the Chicago office of the FBI; and James M. Gibbons, Special Agent-in-Charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Chicago.\u00a0 The government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney Shoba Pillay.\n\nAn F-1 visa permitted a foreign national to study in the United States at a university or other academic institution.\u00a0 An F-1 visa-holder could extend the visa by participating in a program that required the student to obtain temporary employment in their area of study.\u00a0 An H-1B visa permitted U.S.-based employers to temporarily employ foreign nationals in specialty occupations. Foreign nationals with an H-1B visa were permitted to stay in the U.S. for three years, with the possibility of extending their stay to six years.\n\nHuang admitted in a plea agreement that she founded two companies \u2013 FINDREAM LLC and SINOCONTECH LLC \u2013 for the purported purpose of employing foreign nationals in the United States.\u00a0 Huang advertised fraudulent visa-related employment with Findream on websites. In reality, in exchange for a fee, Huang and the companies provided false offer letters and verification of employment letters as purported evidence of employment, knowing the customers did not work at Findream or Sinocontech. Huang also completed, signed, and certified immigration forms detailing the customers\u2019 purported work at the companies. For customers who sought proof of payroll, the customer had to provide the payroll funds to Huang, and Huang then caused direct deposits, falsely purporting to be payroll payments, from Findream\u2019s bank accounts to be deposited in the customers\u2019 bank accounts, and issued Form 1099-MISC tax forms documenting the purported salary.\n\nThe fraud scheme allowed at least approximately 2,693 customers to list Findream or Sinocontech as their employer in order to stay in the U.S. on the visas, Huang further admitted in a plea agreement.\u00a0 Huang and her two companies received at least approximately $1.5 million from customers for whom they agreed to falsely certify employment.\n\n\u201cImmediately upon graduating from a United States-based university, defendant manufactured a scheme to defraud the United States for her own financial benefit and in direct violation of the United States immigration and criminal laws,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Shoba Pillay argued in the government\u2019s sentencing memorandum. \u201cDefendant took her deep understanding of the United States visa system to exploit that system for her own benefit, while creating a significant risk to the United States.\u201d\n\nFindream, which was incorporated in California, and Sinocontech, which was incorporated in Delaware, previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit visa fraud.",

McAllister of the District of Kansas, Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division and Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division made the announcement.\n\n\u201cVentria invested years of research and tens of millions of dollars to create a new and beneficial product,\u201d said U.S. Attorney McAllister. \u201cIt is vital that we protect such intellectual property from theft and exploitation by foreign interests. We all benefit when American companies continue to drive socially valuable advancements in food, medicine and technology.\u201d\n\nWeiqiang Zhang,51, a Chinese national, and U.S. legal permanent resident residing in Manhattan, Kan., was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Carlos Murguia in the District of Kansas. Zhang was convicted on Feb. 15, 2017, of one count of conspiracy to steal trade secrets, one count of conspiracy to commit interstate transportation of stolen property and one count of interstate transportation of stolen property.\n\nEvidence at trial established that Zhang worked as a rice breeder for Ventria Bioscience in Junction City, Kansas. Ventria develops genetically programmed rice to express recombinant human proteins, which are then extracted for use in the therapeutic and medical fields. Zhang has a master\u2019s degree in agriculture from Shengyang Agricultural University in China and a doctorate from Louisiana State University.\n\nAccording to trial evidence, Zhang acquired without authorization hundreds of rice seeds produced by Ventria and stored them at his residence in Manhattan. The rice seeds have a wide variety of health research applications and were developed to produce either human serum albumin, contained in blood, or lactoferrin, an iron-binding protein found, for example, in human milk. Ventria spent millions of dollars and years of research developing its seeds and cost-effective methods to extract the proteins, which are used to develop lifesaving products for global markets. Ventria used locked doors with magnetic card readers to restrict access to the temperature-controlled environment where the seeds were stored and processed.\n\nTrial evidence demonstrated that in the summer of 2013, personnel from a crop research institute in China visited Zhang at his home in Manhattan. Zhang drove the visitors to tour facilities in Iowa, Missouri and Ohio. On Aug. 7, 2013, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers found seeds belonging to Ventria in the luggage of Zhang\u2019s visitors as they prepared to leave the United States for China.\n\n\u201cWeiqiang Zhang betrayed his employer by unlawfully providing its proprietary rice seeds to representatives of a Chinese crop institute,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Cronan. \u201cToday\u2019s sentence demonstrates the significant consequences awaiting those who would steal trade secrets from American companies. The Criminal Division and its law enforcement partners will continue to work closely with companies like Ventria to protect American intellectual property\u2014which is essential to our economy and way of life\u2014against all threats both foreign and domestic.\u201d\n\n\u201cCross-border intellectual property theft not only hurts victim companies, it also threatens our national security,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Demers. \u201cFBI\u2019s vigilance stopped Ventria\u2019s intellectual property from leaving our country in the nick of time, but it was Ventria\u2019s cooperation that allowed us to hold Zhang accountable for his crimes.\u201d\n\nThe FBI\u2019s Little Rock, Arkansas, Field Office and Kansas City, Missouri, Field Office, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Arkansas investigated the case.\u00a0 Trial Attorney Matt Walczewski of the National Security Division, Trial Attorneys Brian Resler and Evan Williams of the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Scott Rask of the District of Kansas prosecuted the case.",

Sun was a Chinese National employed by WVU as an associate professor and the associate director of the United States-China Energy Center at the University. As a part of his employment at WVU, through the West Virginia Development Office, he also acted as the Governor\u2019s assistant for China affairs. He was also employed by Synfuels Americas Corporation, an energy conversion technology provider of coal-to-liquids and gas-to-liquids processes located in Sterling, Virginia, but headquartered in Beijing, China. From July 2011 to May 2015, Peabody Energy Generation Holding Company based in St. Louis, Missouri, paid consulting fees to Energy United LC, a consulting business Sun established in 2005. The scheme involved Sun\u2019s operation of his consulting business through Energy United.\n\nIn 2015, Sun traveled to China on behalf of WVU and the WV Development Office to prepare for an upcoming visit to China by WVU representatives and to lead a West Virginia industrial delegation for a coal expo in Beijing. Sun booked both a coach flight and a business class flight for this trip, submitting a request for reimbursement to WVU for the coach flight, and submitting a request for reimbursement to Synfuels Americas for the business flight. Sun only used the business class ticket for his trip.\n\nIn 2014, Sun filed a joint income tax return with his wife, grossly overstating his business-related travel expenses, when a large sum of those travel expenses were paid for by a State Purchasing Card, or reimbursed to him by WVU and Peabody Energy. He also failed to state any financial interest in, or authority over, a financial account in a foreign country. Sun had an interest in numerous financial accounts in China.\n\nAs a part of the plea agreement, Sun has agreed to pay restitution in the amount of $6,233.12 in full to WVU. \u00a0Sun is no longer employed by WVU.\n\nSun faces up to 20 years of incarceration and a fine of up to $250,000 for wire fraud and faces up to three years of incarceration and a fine of up to $250,000 for tax fraud. Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, the actual sentence imposed will be based upon the seriousness of the offenses and the prior criminal history, if any, of the defendant.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Jarod J.

It will be prosecuted by Assistant United States AttorneyDaniel C. Irick, and Trial Attorneys David C. Recker and Thea D. R. Kendler of the Department of Justice, National Security Division, Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.",

            "article_text": "BOSTON \u2013 A Chinese national was arrested today and charged in connection with violating export laws by conspiring with employees of an entity affiliated with the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) to illegally export U.S. origin goods to China, as well as making false statements to obtain a visa to enter the United States and to become a lawful permanent resident under the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Visa Program.\n\nShuren Qin, 41, a Chinese national residing in Wellesley, Mass., was charged in a criminal complaint with one count of visa fraud and one count of conspiring to commit violations of U.S. export regulations. Qin was arrested today and will appear in federal court in Boston on June 22, 2018.\n\nAccording to charging documents, Qin was born in the People\u2019s Republic of China and became a lawful permanent resident of the United States in 2014. Qin operates several companies in China, which purport to import U.S. and European goods with applications in underwater or marine technologies into China. \u00a0It is alleged that Qin was in communication with and/or receiving taskings from entities affiliated with the PLA, including the Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU), a Chinese military research institute, to obtain items used for anti-submarine warfare.\n\nIn 2001, the Department of Commerce designated NWPU on its Entity List because of the national security risks it poses to the U.S. NWPU has worked closely with the PLA on the advancement of its military capabilities. From at least July 2015 to December 2016, Qin allegedly exported approximately 78 hydrophones (devices used to detect and monitor sound underwater) from the United States to NWPU without obtaining the required export licenses from the Department of Commerce, in violation of U.S. export laws. Qin did so by concealing from the U.S. supplier that NWPU was the end-user and causing false information to be filed with the United States Government.\n\nAs alleged in court documents, in 2014, Qin made false statements on his visa application. Specifically, he falsely certified that he had never \u201cengaged in export control violations or other unlawful activity.\u201d \u00a0However, it is alleged that Qin engaged in numerous violations of U.S. export laws since 2012. In his petition to become a legal permanent resident of the U.S., Qin again falsely certified that he had never committed any crime. Furthermore, during a November 2017, interview with Customs and Board Patrol Officers, Qin stated that he \u201conly\u201d exported instruments that attach to a buoy. However, Qin had allegedly exported remotely-operated side scan sonar systems, unmanned underwater vehicles, unmanned surface vehicles, robotic boats, and hydrophones. These items have military applications and can be used for weapon delivery systems, anti-submarine warfare, mine counter-measures as well as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance activities.\n\nThe charge of conspiring to violate U.S. export laws provides for a sentence of no greater than 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $1 million. The charge of visa fraud provides for a sentence of no greater than 10 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nUnited States Attorney Andrew Lelling; Peter C. Fitzhugh, Special Agent in Charge of the Homeland Security Investigation, Boston Field Office; Leigh Alistair-Barzey, Special Agent in Charge of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, Northeast Field Office; William Higgins, Acting Special Agent in Charge of the Department of Commerce, Office of Export Enforcement, Boston Field Office; Harold H. Shaw, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Boston Field Division; and Leo Lamont, Special Agent in Charge of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, Northeast Field Office made the announcement today. Assistant U.S. Attorney B. Stephanie Siegmann, Chief of Lelling\u2019s National Security Unit is prosecuting the case.\n\nThe details contained in the indictment are allegations.\u00a0 The defendant is presumed to be innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.",

            "article_text": "ST. PAUL, Minn. \u2013 A federal jury found a Hopkins, Minnesota man guilty of distributing controlled substances, including fentanyl, which resulted in the deaths of eleven people and caused serious bodily injury to four people, announced U.S. Attorney Andrew M. Luger.\n\nFollowing a 10-day jury trial before U.S. District Judge Susan Richard Nelson, Aaron Rhy Broussard, 31, was convicted on 17 counts, including conspiracy, importation of fentanyl, possession with intent to distribute fentanyl, distribution of fentanyl resulting in death, distribution of fentanyl resulting in serious bodily injury, and possession with intent to distribute controlled substance analogues.\n\n\u201cAaron Broussard was a black-market drug dealer,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Andrew M. Luger. \u201cConcerned only with his profits, Broussard sold illegal, dangerous drugs over the internet. The defendant\u2019s deadly fentanyl killed eleven young, healthy, and vibrant victims, and caused serious bodily harm to at least four others. Even after Broussard found out his customers were overdosing, he callously continued to ship out deadly drugs. I thank the jury for their service in a difficult case. I offer my condolences and gratitude to the family members of victims across the county who traveled to the District of Minnesota to testify at trial. I applaud the trial team for their work in bringing the defendant to justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s verdict is the culmination of a multi-jurisdictional investigation into an individual who used innovative techniques to supply an incredibly lethal substance to an unwitting community,\u201d Drug Enforcement Administration Omaha Division Special Agent in Charge Justin C. King said. \u201cIn the time since Broussard\u2019s arrest in 2016, our nation has seen an unprecedented rise in overdose deaths attributed to synthetic substances such as fentanyl. As Broussard is now held accountable for his actions, the DEA continues to educate communities on the dangers of this potent substance while also working with our local, state, tribal and federal partners to remove the threat of drug traffickers pushing this highly addictive substance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe prosecution and conviction of Aaron Broussard is an excellent example of multiple law enforcement agencies combining their expertise and resources to conduct investigations with the common goal of taking down internet vendors of illicit narcotics. Broussard worked under the belief he was an anonymous individual selling dangerous narcotics, such as the deadly fentanyl uncovered in this investigation, which resulted in the deaths of almost a dozen citizens. U.S. Postal Inspectors are committed to continuing our work to dismantle drug trafficking operations to keep USPS customers and employees safe from greedy drug traffickers who favor profit over human lives,\u201d stated Inspector in Charge Ruth M. Mendon\u00e7a of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Denver Division.\n\nAccording to the evidence presented at trial, from 2014 through December 6, 2016, Broussard obtained controlled substances, including fentanyl, from China-based drug suppliers. Broussard conspired with his China-based suppliers to smuggle what would prove to be deadly drugs into the country. Broussard marketed these drugs for sale on his website, PlantFoodUSA.net, under the guise of selling plant food. He then used the United States mail and a United States Postal Service \u201cClick-N-Ship\u201d account to send out packages of deadly drugs around the country.\n\nAccording to the evidence presented at trial, on March 12, 2016, Broussard placed a drug order for 100 grams of 4-FA, a controlled substance analogue, which was shipped from China. The package actually contained 100 grams of 99% pure fentanyl. Although Broussard had experienced a similar mix-up in August 2015 and was repeatedly told to test his drugs, he just didn\u2019t bother. Between March 31 and April 27, 2016, Broussard sent his branded packages containing fentanyl to more than a dozen customers throughout the United States. The customers had ordered and were expecting to receive an amphetamine analogue, similar to Adderall. They were not opiate users and had no tolerance for the deadly fentanyl Broussard sent them. After ingesting the fentanyl, believing it was Adderall, eleven of the customers died from a fentanyl overdose, and at least four customers suffered serious bodily injury. Broussard continued distributing his deadly packages despite hearing about adverse reactions. Even after he learned that several customers had been hospitalized and nearly died, Broussard never warned his customers not to take the deadly drugs. Broussard did reach out to his suppliers in China to request a discount on his next drug delivery.\n\nThis case is the result of an investigation conducted by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, in partnership with Homeland Security Investigations, Customs and Border Protection, the University of Minnesota Police Department, the Peoria Heights (Illinois) Police Department, the Dallas (Texas) Police Department, the Broome County (New York) Sheriff\u2019s Office, the Volusia County (Florida) Sheriff\u2019s Office, the Orange County (California) Sheriff\u2019s Office, Garrard County (Kentucky) Sheriff\u2019s Office, Hazel Green (Wisconsin) Police Department, and the Atlanta (Georgia) Police Department.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorneys Thomas M. Hollenhorst and Melinda A. Williams tried the case.",

            "article_text": "Yu Long, 38, a citizen of China and lawful permanent resident of the U.S., waived his right to be indicted and pleaded guilty today in New Haven federal court to charges related to his theft of numerous sensitive military program documents from United Technologies and transporting them to China.\n\nThe announcement was made by Acting Assistant Attorney General for National Security Mary B. McCord, U.S. Attorney Deirdre M. Daly of the District of Connecticut, Special Agent in Charge Patricia M. Ferrick of the New Haven Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent in Charge Matthew Etre of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in Boston, Special Agent in Charge Craig W. Rupert of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) Northeast Field Office, and Special Agent in Charge Danielle Angley of the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations.\n\n\u201cLong admitted to stealing and exploiting highly sensitive military technology and documents, knowing his theft would benefit China\u2019s defense industry and deliberately contravene the embargo on U.S. Munitions List technology the United States has imposed on China,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General McCord. \u201cExport laws exist as an important part of our national security framework and disrupting and prosecuting this kind of economic espionage is one of the National Security Division\u2019s highest priorities.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn an effort to further his own career, this defendant stole an extraordinary amount of proprietary military program information from United Technologies and transported much of that stolen information to China,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Deirdre M. Daly.\u00a0 \u201cHis actions, which he knew would benefit China, not only violated his employment agreement and damaged the company, but have threatened our country's national security interests.\u00a0 U.S. companies continue to be targeted by those who seek to steal intellectual property, trade secrets and advanced defense technology \u2013 whether through a computer hack or cyber intrusion, or through a rogue employee.\u00a0 Working closely with our nation\u2019s defense contractors, we will relentlessly investigate and prosecute those who steal, or attempt to steal, trade secrets and sensitive military information, whether for their own personal gain or for the benefit of foreign actors.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis case highlights the complexity in which the FBI and law enforcement are being challenged to keep the integrity of our industry intellectual property intact,\u201d said Patricia M. Ferrick, Special Agent in Charge of the New Haven Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\u00a0 \u201cInvestigating criminal activity of this nature will continue to be a priority.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese sophisticated technologies are highly sought after by our adversaries,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Matthew Etre of HSI Boston.\u00a0 \u201cThey were developed to give the United States and its allies a distinct military advantage, which is why HSI and our law enforcement partners will continue to aggressively target the individuals who steal the ideas of others and sell these items.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s plea demonstrates the commitment of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) and our federal law enforcement partners to identifying those who illegally export sensitive defense information to adversarial Foreign governments,\u201d said Craig W. Rupert, Special Agent in Charge, DCIS, Northeast Field Office.\u00a0 \u201cDCIS will continue to safeguard sensitive technology and to shield America's investment in national defense by disrupting efforts of groups and individuals who try to illegally acquire our national security assets.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis case was enabled by the outstanding teamwork of the FBI, DCIS, HSI, AFOSI and the U.S. Attorney's office,\u201d said Danielle Angley, Special Agent-in-Charge with the Air Force Office of Special Investigations.\u00a0 \u201cIn addition, it demonstrates the focus of law enforcement agencies to protect our nation's critical resources.\u201d\n\nAccording to court documents and statements made in court, from approximately May 2008 to May 2014, Long worked as a Senior Engineer/Scientist at United Technologies Research Center (UTRC) in Connecticut. Long\u2019s employment at UTRC included work on F119 and F135 engines. The F119 engine is employed by the U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptor fighter aircraft, and the F135 engine is employed by the U.S. Air Force F-35 Lightning II fighter aircraft.\n\nBeginning in 2013, Long expressed his intent to individuals outside UTRC to return to China to work on research projects at certain state-run universities in China using knowledge and materials he had acquired while employed at the UTRC. To that end, Long interacted with several state-run institutions in China, including the Chinese Academy of Science (CAS) and the Shenyang Institute of Automation (SIA), a state-run university in China affiliated with CAS.\n\nDuring 2013 and 2014, Long was recruited by SIA and other state-run universities, during which he leveraged information that he had obtained while working at UTRC to seek employment in China, culminating in his travel to China in the possession of voluminous documents and data containing highly sensitive intellectual property, trade secrets and export controlled technology, which he had unlawfully stolen from UTRC.\n\nIn December 2013, after Long agreed in principle to join SIA, an SIA-CAS Director and an SIA-CAS Recruiter asked Long to provide documents from his work at UTRC and examples of projects on which he had worked to substantiate the claims Long made in his application, and interview with SIA.\u00a0 Long agreed.\n\nOn Dec. 24, 2013, Long emailed several documents to the SIA-CAS Director, including a document that contained the cover page of an export controlled UTRC presentation on Distortion Modeling dated Sept. 30, 2011.\n\nWhile negotiating with SIA, Long also continued to explore other opportunities at other state-run institutions in China. In one email, Long stated: \u201cI have made my mind to return to China, so have prepared a research plan based on my industry experience and current projects.\u201d In the research plan, Long stated: \u201cIn the past five years, I have been working with Pratt Whitney, also other UTC business units, like UTAS (including Hamilton Sundstrand and Goodrich), Sikorsky, CCS (including Carrier and Fire & Security), and Otis. These unique working experiences have provided me a great starting point to perform R&D and further spin off business in China. I believe my efforts will help China to mature its own aircraft engines.\u201d\n\nOn May 30, 2014, Long left UTRC. In June 2014, Long traveled to China and began working for SIA. Beginning in July 2014, digital evidence and forensic analysis indicated that Long brought with him and accessed in China a UTRC external hard drive that had been issued to him and that he unlawfully retained.\n\nIn July 2014, Long was listed as the project leader on a lengthy research plan for CAS involving fourteen other individuals.\u00a0 The plan was replete with references to how the proposed research and development would benefit China. The plan stated: \u201cThe three major engine companies in the world, i.e. GE, Pratt & Whitney in the US and Rolls-Royce in the UK, are all using this technology. . . Our nation lacks the ability to process high performance components, such as airplane wings, tail hooks on carrier aircrafts, and blisks . . . Because of the technology embargo imposed by western developed countries, it is very difficult for us to obtain more advanced design and manufacturing technology . . . This research project will increase our independent ability, efficiency and\u00a0quality in key component manufacturing.\u201d\n\nOn or about Aug. 12, 2014, the Document on Distortion Modeling \u2013 the same document from which Long had sent the cover page to the SIA-CAS Director on Dec. 24, 2013 \u2013 was accessed on the external hard drive. Travel records and forensic analysis confirmed that both Long and the external hard drive were in China when this file was accessed.\n\nOn Aug. 19, 2014, Long returned to the U.S. from China through John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. During a secondary inspection screening by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers, Long was found in the possession of a largely completed application for work with a state-controlled aviation and aerospace research center in China. The application highlighted certain parts of Long\u2019s work related to the F119 and F135 engines while at UTRC.\n\nOn or about Aug. 20, 2014, Long emailed an individual at a university in China, attaching an updated \u201cachievement and future plan.\u201d In the plan, Long discussed his work related to the F119 and F135 U.S. military fighter jet engines and stated that he also had knowledge of unpublished UTRC projects in which the U.S. Air Force had shown interest.\n\nOn Nov. 5, 2014, Long boarded a flight from Ithaca, New York to Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey, with a final destination of China. During Long\u2019s layover in Newark, CBP officers inspected Long\u2019s checked baggage and discovered that it contained sensitive, proprietary and export controlled documents from another defense contractor, Rolls Royce.\n\nFurther investigation determined that the U.S. Air Force had convened a consortium of major defense contractors, including Pratt and Rolls Royce, to work together to see whether they could collectively lower the costs of certain metals used. As part of those efforts, members of the consortium shared technical data, subject to restrictions on further dissemination. Rolls Royce reviewed the documents found in Long\u2019s possession at Newark Liberty Airport and confirmed that it provided the documents to members of the consortium, which included Pratt. Rolls Royce further confirmed that Long was never an employee of Rolls Royce. A review of UTRC computer records indicated that Long had printed the documents while employed at UTRC.\n\nLong was arrested on a federal criminal complaint on Nov. 7, 2014. A review of Long\u2019s digital media seized at the time of his arrest revealed voluminous files protected by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations and Export Administration Regulations, and voluminous files proprietary to various U.S. companies. In short, the investigation revealed that Long took his laptop and the UTRC external hard drive with him to China in 2014, at which time there was a substantial body of highly sensitive, proprietary and export controlled materials present on that digital media. UTRC has confirmed that the hard drive that Long unlawfully retained and accessed in China contained not only documents and data from projects on which Long worked while employed at the company, but also from projects on which he did not work to which he would have had access.\n\nLong pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to engage in the theft of trade secrets knowing that the offense would benefit a foreign government, foreign instrumentality or foreign agent, an offense that carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 15 years. He also pleaded guilty to one count of unlawful export and attempted export of defense articles from the U.S. in violation of the Arms Export Control Act, an offense that carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years.\n\nLong, who has been detained since his arrest, will be sentenced by U.S. District Judge Robert N. Chatigny in Hartford.\u00a0 A sentencing date has not been scheduled.\n\nThis investigation is being led by the FBI in New Haven in coordination with Homeland Security Investigations in New Haven and Newark; the Defense Criminal Investigative Service in New Haven; the U.S. Air Force\u2019s Office of Special Investigations in Boston, Massachusetts; and, the Department of Commerce\u2019s Boston Office of Export Enforcement. U.S. Attorney Daly and Acting Assistant Attorney General McCord also thanked the FBI in Newark, Ithaca and Syracuse, New York, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Service in New York and Newark, and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices for the Northern District of New York and the District of New Jersey, for their efforts and assistance in this matter.\n\nThis case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Tracy Lee Dayton and Stephen B. Reynolds of the District of Connecticut, and Trial Attorneys Brian Fleming and Julie Edelstein of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.",

            "article_text": "SAN JOSE - A federal grand jury in San Jose indicted Ali Kashani, of San Jose, and Yang Zhao, of El Cerrito, Wednesday with wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, United States Attorney Melinda Haag announced.  Mr. Kashani was also indicted for money laundering.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Mr. Kashani, 52, and Ms. Zhao, 40, through their scientific research company, Atlas Scientific, are alleged to have defrauded the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) by creating the false impression that they had not applied for overlapping Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants with both NSF and NASA.  The SBIR program requires that grantees disclose similar or \u201cessentially equivalent\u201d research proposals the grantee has submitted to other federal agencies.\n\nAtlas Scientific, a San Jose-based research company, performed research into adhesive tape based on carbon nanotubes.  Mr. Kashani, the owner and founder of Atlas Scientific, and Ms. Zhao, Atlas\u2019s principal investigator, applied for and received multiple research grants from NSF and NASA.  During each application process, Mr. Kashani and Ms. Zhao allegedly denied having submitted overlapping project proposals to both NSF and NASA.  Mr. Kashani and Ms. Zhao also allegedly denied already having received funding from NSF and NASA, when they requested additional grant monies.\n\nMs. Zhao is additionally alleged to have misrepresented her employment status with the University of California Berkeley, when she applied for these grants.\n\nYesterday, Mr. Kashani was arrested, and made his initial appearance in federal court in San Jose.  Mr. Kashani is currently detained pending a hearing on Tuesday, April 2 at 9:30AM before Magistrate Judge Grewal.\n\nMs. Zhao is currently living in the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nThe maximum penalty for each count of Conspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1349, and for the substantive Wire Fraud counts, is 20 years imprisonment and a fine of $250,000 fine, or twice the gross gain or gross loss from the offense, plus restitution.  The maximum penalty for each count of Engaging in Monetary Transactions in Property Derived from Specified Unlawful Activity, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1957(a), is 10 years imprisonment and a fine of $250,000 fine, or twice the amount of the criminally derived property involved in the transaction, plus restitution.  However, any sentence following conviction would be imposed by the court after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553.\n\nJeff Schenk is the Assistant U.S. Attorney who is prosecuting the case with the assistance of Kamille Singh.  The prosecution is the result of an investigation by the National Science Foundation Office of the Inspector General, NASA Office of the Inspector General, and the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation.\n\nPlease note, an indictment contains only allegations against an individual and, as with all defendants, Mr. Kashani and Ms. Zhao must be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\n\n(Kashani and Zhao indictment)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "article_text": "ALBANY, NEW YORK \u2013 The Research Foundation of the State University of New York (RFSUNY) has paid $313,574 to resolve civil allegations that a research scientist at the State University of University at Albany (UAlbany) failed to disclose his affiliations with and support from a foreign government in connection with federal research funding.\n\nThe settlement relates to National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the United States Department of Commerce (NOAA) grants and research support agreements that provided funding to UAlbany.\u00a0 In the funding application process, NASA and NOAA require disclosure of, among other things, foreign government support received by any principal investigator (PI) on the grant or agreement.\u00a0 The settlement resolves allegations that Research Scientist Dr. Qilong Min failed to disclose his affiliations with and/or funding from the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in connection with Min\u2019s work as PI on three federal research grants from which RFSUNY received funding (the Subject Grants). In particular, UAlbany\u2019s Dr. Min did not disclose that he was receiving funding from PRC during the period of the Subject Grants in connection with: (i) Min's employment with Wuhan University, a public university in China; (ii)Min's participation in a Chinese Talent Plan, a program established by the PRC to recruit individuals with knowledge or access to foreign technology intellectual property; and (iii) grants that funded Min\u2019s research efforts for projects in China from the National Natural Science Foundation of China and other Chinese funding sources.\u00a0 During the United States\u2019 investigation, UAlbany terminated Dr. Min\u2019s employment.\n\n\u201cUniversities, institutions and researchers are required to make certain disclosures when applying for federal grants so that the government can assess whether to fund their research and development,\u201d said United States Attorney Carla B. Freedman. \u201cMy office will hold accountable applicants who undermine the integrity of the grant process by knowingly failing to submit complete and truthful applications.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis settlement demonstrates NASA OIG\u2019s commitment to identifying and holding accountable those who engage in deliberate concealment of affiliations with foreign entities to illegally obtain research funding,\u201d said Adelle K. Harris, Special Agent in Charge of the Eastern Field Office, NASA Office of Inspector General. \u201cI am proud of the exceptional teamwork of our law enforcement partners and the USAO for the Northern District of New York that resulted in securing this settlement and ensuring aggressive oversight of taxpayer funds awarded for academic research.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), Office of Inspector General is determined to protect the integrity of NOAA programs and grant funding,\u201d said Eric Arcand, Special Agent in Charge, DOC Office of Inspector General. \u201cFailure to comply with level of effort reporting requirements when working on NOAA-funded research projects undermines the trust placed in those receiving federal grant funds.\u00a0 We greatly appreciate the efforts by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and our federal law enforcement partners in investigating and resolving this matter.\u201d\n\nThis matter was handled by Assistant U.S. Attorney John D. Hoggan, Jr., with substantial assistance from DOC OIG and NASA OIG.\n\nThe claims resolved by the settlement are allegations only, and there has been no determination of liability.",

Caproni.\n\nU.S. Attorney Damian Williams stated: \u201cLiu Zhongsan sought to exploit the J-1 research scholar program\u2014which is intended to allow foreign nationals to conduct research at approved U.S. institutions\u2014for the improper purpose of enabling his conspirators to work for the Chinese Government in the United States, against the rules of the research scholar program. \u00a0Liu\u2019s conviction reflects this Office\u2019s commitment to holding to account those who seek to defraud this country\u2019s visa system and the agencies responsible for its administration.\u201d\n\nAs reflected in the Indictment, public filings, and the evidence presented at trial:\n\nLIU participated in a scheme to fraudulently procure J-1 research scholar visas for employees of the government of the of the People\u2019s Republic of China (the \u201cPRC Government\u201d) in order to enable them to unlawfully work for the PRC Government in the United States and to conceal that unlawful work from the United States and its agencies.\n\nLIU operated an office of the China Association for the International Exchange of Personnel (\u201cCAIEP\u201d), an agency of the PRC Government, in Fort Lee, New Jersey.\u00a0 Among other activities, CAIEP engages in talent-recruitment for the benefit of the PRC, including recruiting U.S. scientists, academics, engineers, and other experts to work in China.\n\nFrom 2017 up to and including September 2019, Liu worked with others to fraudulently procure J-1 research scholar visas for PRC Government employees in order to enable those employees to unlawfully work for CAIEP in the United States and to conceal that unlawful work from the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security. \u00a0The J-1 research scholar program permits foreign nationals to come to the United States for the primary purpose of conducting research at a corporate research facility, museum, library, university, or other research institution.\u00a0 LIU worked with others to obtain a J-1 research scholar visa for a prospective CAIEP employee, Sun Li, based on the false representation that Sun Li would conduct research at a U.S. university, and to conceal the unlawful work of another CAIEP employee, Liang Xiao, who was present in the United States on a J-1 visa sponsored by a U.S. university.\n\nIn or about April 2018, Liang Xiao applied for and received a J-1 visa to conduct research at that U.S. university.\u00a0 Although Liang represented to the U.S. Government that she was entering the United States for the primary purpose of conducting research at the university, Liang\u2019s actual purpose in the United States consisted of working for CAIEP.\u00a0 LIU helped Liang take measures to enhance her false appearance as a research scholar by, among other things, directing Liang to report to the university upon her arrival in the United States; ensuring that Liang obtained a local driver\u2019s license; and disguising Liang\u2019s CAIEP salary as a subsidy for a research scholar\u2019s living expenses.\n\nIn addition, LIU sought to enable Sun Li to obtain a J-1 research scholar visa under false pretenses.\u00a0 In particular, LIU reached out to contacts at multiple U.S. universities in order to arrange for a university to invite Sun Li to come to the United States as a J-1 research scholar.\u00a0 In truth and in fact, however, LIU intended that Sun Li\u2019s primary purpose in the United States would consist of working for CAIEP.\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0*\n\nLIU, 59, of Fort Lee, New Jersey, was convicted of one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States and to commit visa fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of five years.\u00a0 The maximum potential sentence in this case is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the judge.\u00a0 Sentencing before Judge Caproni is scheduled for July 11, 2022.\n\nMr. Williams praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI, and thanked the U.S. Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, Homeland Security Investigations, and the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section of the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s National Security Division for their assistance.\n\nThe prosecution of this case is being handled by the Office\u2019s National Security and International Narcotics Unit.\u00a0 Assistant United States Attorneys Gillian Grossman and Elinor Tarlow are in charge of the prosecution, with assistance from Trial Attorneys Adam Barry and Scott Claffee of the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.\n\n",

Wang, a citizen of the People\u2019s Republic of China, was attending Southeast Missouri State University on a student visa at the time. Numerous items were seized from Wang\u2019s residence, including his cell phone and computer. Investigators subsequently discovered a large volume of child pornography on the devices.

            "article_text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 An Ohio man and rheumatology professor and researcher with strong ties to China was sentenced to 37 months in prison for making false statements to federal authorities as part of an immunology research fraud scheme. As part of his sentence, Zheng was also ordered to pay more than $3.4 million in restitution to the National Institute of Health (NIH) and approximately $413,000 to The Ohio State University.\n\nSong Guo Zheng, 58, of Hilliard, was arrested Friday, May 22, 2020, after he arrived in Anchorage, Alaska, aboard a charter flight and as he prepared to board another charter flight in order to flee to China. He was carrying three large bags, one small suitcase and a briefcase containing two laptops, three cell phones, several USB drives, several silver bars, expired Chinese passports for his family, deeds for property in China and other items. He was transported to the Southern District of Ohio and made his first federal court appearance in Columbus last July.\n\nZheng pleaded guilty last November and admitted he lied on applications in order to use approximately $4.1 million in grants from NIH to develop China\u2019s expertise in the areas of rheumatology and immunology.\n\n\u201cIn yet another case involving the Chinese government\u2019s Thousand Talents program, Song Guo Zheng will spend the next 37 months in a federal prison because he chose to lie and hide his involvement in this program from U.S. research funding agencies,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers for the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division. \u201cAmerican research funding is provided by the American taxpayer for the benefit of American society \u2014 not as an illicit gift to the Chinese government. The American people deserve total transparency when federal dollars are being provided for research, and we will continue to hold accountable those who choose to lie about their foreign government affiliations in an attempt to fraudulently gain access to these funds.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor years the defendant concealed his participation in Chinese government talent recruitment programs, hiding his affiliations with at least five research institutions in China,\u201d said Assistant Director Alan E. Kohler Jr. of the FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Division. \u201cZheng greedily took federal research dollars and prevented others from receiving funding for critical research in support of medical advances. The FBI will continue to pursue people wherever they may be, even on a plane, in Alaska, in the middle of the night.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe hope Zheng\u2019s prison sentence deters others from having anything to do with China\u2019s so-called \u20181000 Talents Plan\u2019 or any of its variations,\u201d said Acting U.S. Attorney Vipal J. Patel for the Southern District of Ohio. \u201cStealing is stealing but stealing at the behest of a foreign government\u2019s concerted effort to pilfer our nation\u2019s innovations and technology takes things to a new and significantly worse level.\u201d\n\n\u201cZheng\u2019s sentencing today is a recognition of the constant threat posed by the Chinese government to steal research funded by American taxpayers,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Chris Hoffman for the FBI\u2019s Cincinnati Field Office. \u201cZheng\u2019s failure to disclose his foreign funding and support damages the trust and undermines the credibility the American people place in U.S. research, while abusing the openness and transparency that is a core value of U.S. academia. This sentence should serve as a deterrent and underscores the FBI\u2019s commitment to work with our partners to investigate individual\u2019s whose actions throw a cloud over the cutting-edge work being done at U.S. universities.\u201d\n\n\u201cReporting potential conflicts of interest when seeking grant funding from the National Institutes of Health is imperative in ensuring the public\u2019s trust in the research being conducted and how it is utilized,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Lamont Pugh III for the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services\u2019 Office of Inspector General, Chicago Region. \u201cMaking false statements to conceal potential conflicts violates that trust and the law. The OIG is committed to identifying and investigating instances where individuals intentionally fail to report or falsify information regarding their sources of research support in order to ensure the proper use of taxpayer dollars.\u201d\n\nAccording to court documents, Zheng was a professor of internal medicine who led a team conducting autoimmune research at The Ohio State University and Pennsylvania State University. According to his plea, Zheng caused materially false and misleading statements on NIH grant applications, seeking to hide his participation in Chinese Talent Plans and his affiliation and collaboration with a Chinese university controlled by the Chinese government.\n\nAccording to court documents, since 2013, Zheng had been participating in a Chinese Talent Plan, a program established by the Chinese government to recruit individuals with knowledge or access to foreign technology intellectual property. Since that time, Zheng used research conducted in the United States to benefit the People\u2019s Republic of China. Zheng failed to disclose conflicts of interest or his foreign commitments to his American employers or to the NIH.\n\nActing U.S. Attorney Patel acknowledged the assistance of the Anchorage FBI Division who arrested Zheng, interviewed him and executed multiple warrants while he was detained, and the assistance provided by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Alaska.\n\nThis case was investigated by the FBI and Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Douglas W. Squires and S. Courter Shimeall, Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher N. St. Pierre, and Trial Attorney Matthew J. McKenzie with NSD\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are representing the United States in this case. Chief U.S. District Judge Algenon L. Marbley imposed the sentence today.\n\nView this press release in Mandarin",

            "article_text": "LOS ANGELES\u2013 Federal authorities this morning arrested five defendants linked to a scheme that helped Chinese nationals obtain student visas by hiring individuals who used fake Chinese passports to take an English proficiency test for the foreign students.\n\nThe arrests were made pursuant to a 26-count indictment returned on Friday by a federal grand jury. The indictment charges the defendants with conspiring to use false passports, using false passports, and aggravated identity theft as part of the scheme to impersonate Chinese nationals who were required to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) to obtain a student visa.\n\nThe five defendants were taken into custody this morning without incident. They are:\n\nLiu Cai, 23, of Woodland Hills, who allegedly facilitated the scheme, took at least five TOEFL exams himself and is residing in the United States on a student visa;\n\nQuang Cao, 24, of San Francisco, who allegedly took at least four TOEFL exams with false identification, and who was arrested today in Stockton, California;\n\nElric Zhang, 24, of Los Angeles, who allegedly took at least five TOEFL exams as part of the scheme;\n\nMohan Zhang, 24, of Cerritos, who allegedly took at least two TOEFL exams under the names of foreign nationals; and\n\nThe four Southern California defendants are expected to be arraigned on the indictment this afternoon in United States District Court in downtown Los Angeles. Cao is expected to make an initial appearance this afternoon in the Eastern District of California.\n\nThe sixth defendant in the case \u2013 Tuan Tran, 33, who allegedly took at least one TOEFL exam with a false identification document \u2013 is believed to be currently residing in Taiwan.\n\nThe United States requires foreign citizens who wish to enter the United States on a temporary basis to study at a college or university to first obtain an F-1 student visa. To obtain a student visa, foreign citizens must first apply to study at a school that has been authorized by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) to enroll foreign students. In the United States, many SEVP-certified schools require foreign citizens whose first language is not English to certify proficiency in English by achieving a particular score on the TOEFL.\n\nWhen the foreign national goes to a TOEFL testing location, the test taker must present an original, non-expired, government-issued identification document recognized by their home country. According to the indictment, all six defendants used counterfeit People\u2019s Republic of China passports to impersonate 19 different Chinese nationals at various TOEFL testing locations in and around Los Angeles.\n\nThe indictment further alleges that Cai paid for and registered 14 Chinese nationals for TOEFL exams over a one-year period in 2015 and 2016. Following the tests, Cai allegedly paid three co-defendants approximately $400 per test from his PayPal and Venmo accounts.\n\nAn indictment contains allegations that a defendant has committed a crime. Every defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThe conspiracy count in the indictment carries a statutory maximum penalty of five years in federal prison. The charge of using a false passport carries a maximum sentence of 10 years. Aggravated identity theft carries a mandatory consecutive two-year sentence.\n\nThis case is being investigated by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations, the State Department\u2019s Diplomatic Security Service, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service\u2019s Fraud Detection National Security Section. The Educational Testing Service, which administers the TOEFL exam, has provided assistance during the investigation.\n\nThis matter is being prosecuted by Special Assistant United States Attorney Kyle J. Ryan of the General Crimes section.",

U.S. District Court Judge Allison D. Burroughs sentenced Zhang to time-served and ordered her to be immediately removed from the United States to the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\n\n\nIn December 2015, Zhang registered to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) exam, which is required by American universities that participate in DHS\u2019s Student and Exchange Visitor Program. On prior occasions, Zhang failed to achieve a high enough score on the TOEFL exam to be admitted to a participating American university. When Zhang registered to take the exam again in December 2015, she provided her passport and exam registration information to a co-conspirator who used the materials to take the exam for Zhang. The co-conspirator scored high on the exam, and Zhang fraudulently submitted the co-conspirator\u2019s test results as her own and was subsequently admitted into an American university. \u00a0Once admitted, Zhang was issued DHS\u2019s Form I-20, which made her eligible to receive an F-1 non-immigrant student visa to enter and remain in the United States for the duration of her studies.\n\n\n\nActing United States Attorney William D.

            "article_text": "Roanoke, VIRGINIA \u2013 Yiheng Percival Zhang, a former Virginia Tech professor studying artificial sweeteners, was sentenced last week in U.S. District Court to time served, which included incarceration for approximately three months, and home incarceration for approximately two years, First Assistant United States Attorney Daniel P. Bubar announced today.\u00a0 Zhang was convicted of committing federal grant fraud, making false statements and obstruction by falsification following a bench trial in September 2018.\n\nZhang, 47, of Blacksburg, Va., was found guilty of one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, three counts of making false statements, and one count of obstruction by falsification.\n\n\u201cThe government has an obligation to ensure that the limited funds from these important programs are being used for legitimate research projects that enhance innovation and technological advancement,\u201d First Assistant United States Attorney Bubar said today. \u201cI am proud of the work of the men and women with the National Science Foundation (NSF), Department of Energy, and Federal Bureau of Investigation for conducting a thorough investigation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Small Business Innovation Research Program is a valuable tool in advancing NSF\u2019s mission to promote the progress of science by increasing opportunities for small businesses to undertake cutting-edge scientific research, and it is essential to protect the integrity of this program,\u201d stated National Science Foundation Inspector General Allison Lerner. \u00a0\u201cThe NSF Office of Inspector General is committed to vigorously pursuing oversight of these taxpayer funds and I commend the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and our investigative partners for their support in this effort.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Department of Energy, Office of Inspector General works diligently to protect the integrity of the SBIR and STTR programs. These programs are critically important in the generation of scientific breakthroughs and technological innovations.\u00a0 Those who defraud our programs and steal our innovations are a threat to our nation,\u201d said Department of Energy Inspector General Teri L. Donaldson. \u201cWe will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to hold all who violate the integrity of our Nation's scientific programs accountable.\u00a0 We appreciate the efforts of the U.S. Attorney's Office and our law enforcement partners on this joint investigation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe FBI is committed to working with our federal, state, and local partners to protect the integrity of funding programs that promote the development of advanced technology and strengthen the U.S. economy,\u201d said David W. Archey, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI\u2019s Richmond Division. \u201cWe are grateful for the partnership of the United States Attorney\u2019s Office, the Department of Energy Inspector General, the National Science Foundation Inspector General, the Blacksburg Police Department and the Virginia Tech Police Department during this investigation.\u201d\n\nAccording to evidence presented at trial, Zhang, who at the time of the offenses was a biological systems engineering professor at Virginia Tech, founded Cell-Free Bioinnovations, Inc. (\u201cCFB\u201d), a research firm located in Blacksburg, Virginia. CFB relied exclusively on federal grants for funding its research activities. Zhang began working as a paid researcher for the Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences by, at least, 2014.\u00a0 In 2015, Zhang caused fraudulent grant proposals to be submitted to the NSF under the Small Business Innovation Research Program (\u201cSBIR\u201d). Evidence presented at trial indicated grant funds obtained would be used for research Zhang knew had already been done in China. Zhang intended to use the grant funds for other CFB projects rather than for the projects for which the funds were requested. To obstruct the investigation, Zhang submitted falsified timesheets to government investigators.\n\nThe investigation of the case was conducted by the National Science Foundation-Office of the Inspector General, Department of Energy-Office of the Inspector General, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and with the assistance of the Blacksburg Police Department, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, with the assistance of the Blacksburg Police Department and the Virginia Tech Police Department.\u00a0 Assistant United States Attorneys Kate Rumsey and Randy Ramseyer, and former Assistant United States Attorney Steve Pfleger prosecuted the case for the United States.",

            "article_text": "ALBUQUERQUE  \u2013 Jianyu Huang, a scientist formerly employed by Sandia Corporation (Sandia) at  Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), pleaded guilty this afternoon to making a  false statement and unlawfully transporting converted government property in  interstate and foreign commerce.\u00a0 The guilty plea was announced by U.S.  Attorney Damon P. Martinez and Special Agent in Charge Carol K.O. Lee of the  FBI\u2019s Albuquerque Division.\n\nHuang,  46, a naturalized U.S. citizen from the People\u2019s Republic of China who resides  in Albuquerque, N.M., was arrested in June 2012, on a six-count indictment  charging him with misusing U.S. government resources and equipment to conduct  research for Chinese research institutions and with falsely stating that he did  not intend to take U.S. government equipment with him on a trip to China.\u00a0  The indictment subsequently was superseded to add an interstate transportation  of converted property charge and a theft of government property charge.\u00a0  Huang was employed by Sandia until his employment was terminated in late April  2012.\n\nSNL  is a government-owned research facility operated by Sandia Corporation for the  U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)  that is responsible for ensuring the safety of the nation\u2019s nuclear stockpile;  enhancing the security of energy and other critical resources; reducing the  proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; addressing threats to national  security; and protecting the nation against terrorism.\u00a0 The Center for  Integrated Nanotechnologies (CiNT) is a DOE user facility and science research  center devoted to establishing scientific principles that govern the design,  performance, and integration of materials on the atomic and molecular scale,  located at SNL.\n\nIn  light of the sensitivity of SNL\u2019s work, all Sandia employees are required to  report to the Sandia Office of Counterintelligence (SOC) any substantive  relationship with foreign nationals, including associations that involve  meeting and sharing work-related information.\u00a0 Sandia employees also are  required to submit to interviews with SOC before international travel on  official business, and are prohibited from bringing government-owned equipment  on international travel without prior approval.\n\nHuang  was employed by Sandia at CiNT, where he worked in an unclassified open science  facility without access to classified national security information.\u00a0 As a  Sandia employee, Huang was prohibited from bringing government-owned equipment  on international travel without prior approval.\n\nCounts  1 through 5 of the second superseding indictment charged Huang with federal  program fraud and alleged that between Jan. 2009 and Jan. 2012, Huang  unlawfully and without authority used DOE equipment, materials and property to  conduct research for businesses and universities in the People\u2019s Republic of  China.\u00a0 Count 6 charged Huang with making a false statement charge to a  federal officer and alleged that, in June 2011, Huang falsely represented to a  counterintelligence officer that he would not take any U.S. government  electronic equipment with him on an upcoming trip to the People\u2019s Republic of  China.\u00a0 The statement was false because Huang knew that he intended to  take a U.S. government computer and hard-drive to the People\u2019s Republic of  China on that trip, and did in fact take that equipment with him.\u00a0 Count 7  charged Huang with the interstate transportation of converted property charge  and alleged that between June 30, 2011 and July 18, 2011, Huang unlawfully  transported a DOE-owned laptop computer and computer-related media in  interstate and foreign commerce.\u00a0 Count 8 charged Huang with an  embezzlement charge and alleged that between April 25, 2012 and June 2, 2012,  Huang embezzled electronic files and documents, including research proposals,  belonging to DOE that came into his possession by virtue of his employment with  SNL.\n\nDuring  his plea hearing this afternoon, Huang pled guilty to Counts 6 and 7 of the  second superseding indictment.\u00a0 In his plea agreement, Huang admitted  taking a trip to China in July 2011, for the purpose of attending and making a  presentation at a research conference.\u00a0 Huang acknowledged that in seeking  and obtaining Sandia\u2019s permission to participate in the conference, he  represented that he would not take any DOE-owned equipment with him.\u00a0  Huang also admitted deliberately lying to a counterintelligence office when he  made the representation because he intended to take his DOE-owned laptop on the  trip.\n\nHuang  admitted taking a DOE-owned laptop computer with him when he traveled to China  on June 30 and July 1, 2011, even though he knew that he did not have permission  to do so.\u00a0 In so doing, Huang unlawfully converted the laptop computer to  his own use.\u00a0 According to Huang\u2019s plea agreement, U.S. Customs and Border  Protection agents seized the DOE-owned laptop from Huang\u2019s baggage when he  returned to the United States on July 18, 2011, after Huang admitted that he  did not have permission to take the laptop computer out of the country.\n\nUnder  the terms of the plea agreement, Huang will be sentenced to a year and a day in  federal prison followed by a term of supervised release to be determined by the  court.\u00a0 Huang\u2019s sentencing hearing has yet to be  scheduled.\n\nThe  case was investigated by the Albuquerque Division of the FBI and is being  prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathon M. Gerson.",

            "article_text": "An Arkansas man and University of Arkansas Professor pleaded guilty today to one count of making a false statement to the FBI about the existence of patents for his inventions in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).\n\nSimon Saw-Teong Ang, 64, of Fayetteville, entered a guilty plea to count 58 on a superseding indictment charging him with making a materially false and fictitious\u00a0statement and representation to an FBI Special Agent. According to court documents, 24 patents filed in the People\u2019s Republic of China bear Ang\u2019s name or Chinese birth name. The University of Arkansas, where Ang worked as a professor, required individuals such as Ang to promptly furnish to the University \u201cfull and complete\u201d disclosures of inventions, and University policy provided that it, not individual inventors, would own all inventions created by those subject to the policy. This policy was established \u201cin furtherance of the commitment of the University to the widest possible distribution of the benefits of University Research, the protection of Inventions resulting from such research, and the development of Inventions for the public good.\u201d\n\nDespite this requirement, Ang did not disclose his Chinese patents to the university and, when interviewed by an FBI agent, lied about his involvement in the inventions. Specifically, when asked whether his name would be listed as \u201cthe inventor\u201d of numerous patents in China, Ang denied being the inventor, despite knowing he was. In addition, Ang also received numerous talent awards from the PRC government, which he did not list on the university\u2019s annual conflict of interest disclosure forms.\n\nAng\u2019s sentencing is expected to take place in approximately four months. Ang faces a maximum penalty of 5 years in prison for the crime for which he pleaded guilty, however, the plea agreement also states that if the court wishes to sentence Ang to a sentence that is not a year and a day in federal prison, Ang will have the right to withdraw from the plea agreement. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Matthew G.

            "article_text": "CLARKSBURG, WEST VIRGINIA \u2013 Eleven law enforcement members were recognized today for their outstanding work in the greater Clarksburg area.\n\nU.S. Attorney Bill Powell recognized WV State Police Cpl. John W. Smith, FBI Special Agent Fred Aldridge, FBI Special Agent Matt Eagles, DEA Diversion Investigator Guy McCartney, DEA Diversion Investigator Chris Skaggs, WV State Police Sgt. Rob Talkington, Bridgeport Police Lt. Gary Weaver, WV State Police Task Force Commander Josh Tallman, FBI Special Agent Peter Olinits, FBI Special Agent Jared Jankowski, FBI Special Agent Justin Van Tromp, and IRS Special Agent Tami Devericks for their exemplary work.\n\n\u201cHonoring those who go above and beyond to protect our children, our community and our national security is a great privilege. While this year has created exceptional challenges, they continue their great work to keep our communities safer. \u00a0Those honored today never seek recognition, but it is important to let the public know about the accomplishments of our law enforcement members. \u00a0I thank each and every one of them for their continued service,\u201d said Powell.\n\nWest Virginia State Police Cpl. J.W. Smith and FBI Special Agent Aldridge conducted an arduous two-year investigation resulting in the successful prosecution of former Harrison County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Tim Rock for distributing drugs to his confidential informants in 2016. \u00a0Cpl. Smith and Special Agent Aldridge conducted dozens of interviews, often with hard-to-locate subjects, active drug users, uncooperative witnesses, and Rock himself. \u00a0They poured over and organized hundreds of pages of law enforcement records and reports Their work was exceptional, and Rock\u2019s conviction was uniquely important to the county and the law enforcement community. Rock was sentenced to more than 58 months in prison.For the successful outcome of this case and their important roles in the investigation, the Outstanding Investigative Effort Award was given to Cpl. J.W. Smith and Special Agent Fred Aldridge.\n\nFBI Special Agent Matt Eagles, DEA Diversion Investigator Guy McCartney, DEA Diversion Investigator Chris Skaggs worked tirelessly in the prosecution of several physicians and others in a prescription drug case. The Dr. Felix Brizuela investigation began in January 2015 as a DEA investigation into Dr. Brizuela\u2019s prescribing practices. It soon became evident that Dr. Brizuela was engaging in healthcare fraud, the FBI joined the investigation. The investigation quickly expanded to other targets, including Dr. George Naum, Sharon Jackson and Eric Drake. Investigator McCartney and Special Agent Eagles spent the next four years investigating these individuals and preparing the case for trial. Their investigation included collecting and reviewing over 650,000 documents, among which were hundreds of patient medical charts from two different medical practices. The agents executed search warrants on five physical locations and three email accounts. They also interviewed over one hundred witnesses. Ms. Jackson and Mr. Drake resolved their cases by plea agreement. Dr. Naum was found guilty after a lengthy trial and sentenced to 6 months incarceration and 6 months home confinement and ordered to forfeit over $75,000.00 in ill-gotten gains. Dr. Brizuela pled guilty last week. He was sentenced to time served which equaled six months, and three years of supervised release. During this time, he is not permitted to request a license to prescribe medications from the DEA. \u00a0Investigator Guy McCartney and Special Agent Matt Eagles devoted many long and tedious hours to investigating and seeing through this complex case to prosecution, and Investigator Chris Skaggs stepped in and carried the case through to sentencing. For all of their hard work, they each received the Outstanding Investigative Effort Award.\n\nWV State Police Sgt. Rob Talkington has been doing child exploitation cases for a long time. His experience is reflected in his poise and in his decision-making. \u00a0His hard work in the Tara Ponceroff and Ian Toothman child pornography cases. \u00a0A sharp eye and some excellent investigative work led law enforcement to believe that there were child pornographic images on Toothman\u2019s phone, and that Ponceroff was the depicted female in the pictures. He was able to ascertain the identity of the victim (whose face was not visible). Both defendants pled guilty and were given severe sentences for their conduct. Toothman is serving 278 months and Ponceroff is serving 360 months. Sgt. Talkington also handled the James Smith child pornography case in which Smith, a previously convicted offender, was engaging in an extremely sexual chat with various teenaged boys. Smith pled guilty and was sentenced to 168 months in prison. Sgt. Rob Talkington was honored with the Outstanding Investigative Effort Award.\n\nLt. Gary Weaver with the Bridgeport Police Department is a staunch force for good in the fight against child exploitation. Lt. Weaver was a key part of the investigations into Jeremy Smith, Jack Rice, and Quionte Crawford, all child pornography cases. Rice was sentenced to 57 months in prison. Jeremy Smith pled guilty to a child pornography charge and was sentenced to 51 months in prison. Lt. Weaver put forth an extraordinary effort on the Crawford case. Crawford had befriended and groomed teenaged boys he met at youth baseball games and tournaments. Crawford groomed their parents as well. Then he would approach them on-line in the persona of a sexually eager 18-year-old girl. \u00a0Lt. Weaver\u2019s patience with the victims was exemplary. Crawford received a life sentence for his crimes. Lt. Weaver was also integral in the case against defendant James Vincent Scott. Lt. Weaver posed online as a 15 y/o female, in which Scott sent sexually explicit text to what he thought was an underage female. He solicited pictures. He then agreed to meet the \u201cfemale\u201d for sex and drove from Ohio to Bridgeport for the purpose of meeting her. \u00a0Scott pled guilty and was sentenced to 50 months. \u00a0Lt. Weaver received the Outstanding Investigative Effort Award.\n\nOn the evening of Monday, August 5, 2019, Task Force Commander J. M. Tallman, as well as other troopers, responded to Pocahontas County to assist in the search of an armed subject. \u00a0The suspect had fired upon the Pocahontas County Sheriff and one of his deputies after a single vehicle crash and fled into a heavily wooded area. \u00a0TFC Tallman and another trooper went with a Huttonsville Prison K-9 unit in an attempt to track and locate the suspect. \u00a0TFC Tallman heard movement in the brush and observed the suspect appear from behind some trees with a rifle. \u00a0TFC Tallman instructed the suspect to put the gun down. \u00a0An exchange of gunfire ensued, and the suspect charged toward TFC Tallman. \u00a0TFC Tallman was struck in the abdomen with a high-powered rifle. \u00a0The round had struck TFC Tallman\u2019s cap stun and duty belt buckle before traveling through the lower part of his Kevlar vest and into his abdomen. \u00a0The suspect continued charging at TFC Tallman at which time a physical altercation ensued. \u00a0 TFC Tallman transitioned to his 9mm duty weapon and fired several rounds as the suspect was attempting to disarm him. \u00a0TFC Tallman\u2019s duty weapon malfunctioned and TFC Tallman transitioned back to his AR-15 and fired a single round, fatally wounding the suspect. TFC Tallman was treated on scene by Troopers and flown to Ruby Memorial Hospital via WVSP Aviation. TFC Tallman has since recovered from his injuries and continues his work. For his bravery and selflessness, Task Force Commander Josh Tallman was given the Heroic Effort Award.FBI Special Agent Peter Olinits, IRS Special Agent Tami Devericks, FBI Special Agent Jared Jankowski, and FBI Special Agent Justin Van Tromp worked tirelessly on two cases involving Chinese nationals.Dr. Qingyun Sun, a Chinese national, was employed by West Virginia University as a professor since 2001 and contracted to the West Virginia Development Office, within the West Virginia Department of Commerce, to act as the governor\u2019s assistant for China affairs since 2008. \u00a0Dr. James Patrick Lewis, an American citizen, was employed by WVU as a physics professor since 2006. \u00a0The investigations involved countless hours of investigative work and hundreds of documents. Dr. Sun pled guilty to wire fraud and tax fraud in July 2020 and is awaiting sentencing in December 2020. Dr. Lewis pled guilty to federal program fraud in March 2020 and was sentenced to three months of incarceration and fined $9,363 for the costs of the incarceration and was ordered to pay more than $20,000 in restitution to WVU. FBI Special Agent Peter Olinits, IRS Special Agent Tami Devericks, FBI Special Agent Jared Jankowski, and FBI Special Agent Justin Van Tromp were vital to the resolutions in both cases and were presented with Outstanding Investigative Effort Awards.\n\nThe ceremony was held in the Clarksburg Federal Courthouse and included remarks from U.S. Attorney Bill Powell and the presence of many local, state and federal law enforcement leaders from throughout West Virginia.\n\nOther ceremonies were held in Martinsburg and Wheeling to honor more recipients of the U.S. Attorney Awards.",

All were  charged in connection with their respective roles in a conspiracy to distribute  methylone in New Jersey and New York. \u201cBath salts\u201d is the street name for a  family of designer drugs that have effects similar to amphetamine and cocaine.  Their white and yellow crystals often resemble legal bath salts, like Epsom  salts, but are chemically different.The current investigation involved a package containing approximately  two kilograms of methylone that was intercepted by law enforcement. The package  originated in the People\u2019s Republic of China and was supposed to be shipped to  an address in Old Bridge. Law enforcement removed the methylone and replaced it  with sham drugs that resembled bath salts. On March 14, 2013, law enforcement  delivered the package and watched over the next two days as Knierim, Jobes,  Caturano, and Healion transferred the package among themselves. After their  arrests, a number of the defendants admitted that they had distributed multiple  kilograms of bath salts over the past year and that some of the drugs were sold  at local college campuses, including Rutgers University and Monmouth  University. As part of the investigation, agents of Immigration and Customs  Enforcement-Homeland Security Investigations seized more than $90,000 in cash  and two luxury automobiles obtained with proceeds from the drug conspiracy.Healion was the first to be sentenced before Judge Pisano, who also  sentenced him to three years of supervised release. Caturano, Jobes and Knierim  will each be sentenced by Judge Pisano on Sept. 22, 2014, Oct. 9, 2014, and Oct.  15, 2014, respectively.U.S. Attorney Fishman credited special agents of the ICE-HSI, under  the direction of Special Agent in Charge Andrew M. McLees; inspectors of the  U.S. Postal Inspection Service, under the direction of Acting Inspector in  Charge Maria L. Kelokates; and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, under the direction  of Robert E.

            "article_text": "DENVER \u2013 Executive Recycling,  Inc. (a corporation) and Brandon Richter, age38, of Highlands Ranch, Colorado, the owner and chief  executive officer of Executive Recycling, were sentenced today by U.S. District Court Judge William J. Martinez for their  roles in a fraudulent scheme related to the disposal and exportation of electronic  waste to foreign countries, announced United States Attorney John Walsh, U.S.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations  (HSI) Special Agent in Charge Kumar Kibble and EPA Criminal Investigation  Division Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey Martinez.\u00a0 Executive Recycling, the corporation, was sentenced to  pay a $4,500,000 fine and serve 3 years on  probation.\u00a0 Richter was ordered to serve 30 months in federal prison,  followed by 3 years on supervised release.\u00a0 Judge Martinez also ordered  Richter to pay a $7,500 fine and $70,144 in restitution  joint and several with the victims of the crime.\u00a0 Richter was ordered to  report to a Bureau of Prisons facility within 15 days of designation.\u00a0  Judge Martinez also ordered $142,241.10 in asset forfeiture.\n\nThe defendants were convicted in December 2012 of  multiple counts of mail and wire fraud and environmental crimes related to the  illegal disposal of electronic waste, smuggling, and obstruction of justice,  following an 11-day trial.\n\nLast week former vice president of operations,  Tor Olson, age38, of Parker, Colorado, was sentenced  to serve 14 months in prison, pay a $5,000 fine,  and pay over $15,000 in restitution.\u00a0  Olson remains free on bond pending appeal.\n\nExecutive Recycling, Inc., as a corporation,  Brandon Richter and Tor Olson were indicted by a federal grand jury in Denver  on September 15, 2011. The jury trial before Judge Martinez began on December  3, 2012. The jury reached their verdict on December 21, 2012.\u00a0 Olson was sentenced on July  17, 2013.\n\nAccording to the indictment, as well as the  facts presented at trial, Executive Recycling was an electronic waste recycling  business located in Englewood, Colorado with affiliated locations in Utah and  Nebraska. The company collected electronic waste from private households,  businesses, and government entities. Executive Recycling was registered with  the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment as a \u201cLarge Quantity  Handler of Universal Waste.\u201d Richter, as owner and CEO, was responsible for  supervising all aspects of the company. Olson, the vice president of  operations, was responsible for running day-to-day operations.\n\nA significant portion of electronic waste  collected by the defendants were Cathode Ray Tubes (CRTs). CRTs are the glass  video display component of an electronic device, usually a computer or  television monitor, and are known to contain lead. The defendants engaged in  the practice of exporting electronic waste, including CRTs, from the United  States to foreign countries, including the People\u2019s Republic of China. The  defendants regularly negotiated the sale of electronic waste to brokers who  represented foreign buyers or who sold the electronic waste overseas. The  foreign buyers often paid the defendants directly. To transport the electronic  waste, the defendants used shipping cargo containers which were loaded at the  company\u2019s facility. The containers were then transported by rail to domestic  ports for export overseas.\n\nExecutive Recycling appeared as the exporter of  record in over 300 exports from the United States between 2005 and 2008.  Approximately 160 of these exported cargo containers contained a total of more  than 100,000 CRTs.\n\nBetween February 2005 and continuing through  January 2009, the defendants knowingly devised and intended to devise a scheme  to defraud various business and government entities who wanted to dispose of  their electronic waste, and to obtain these business and government entities\u2019  money by means of materially false and fraudulent pretenses. The defendants  represented themselves on a website to have \u201cextensive knowledge of current EPA  requirements.\u201d The defendants falsely advertised to customers that they would  dispose of electronic waste in compliance with all local, state and federal  laws and regulations. It was part of the scheme that the defendants falsely  represented that they would dispose of all electronic waste, whether hazardous  or not, in an environmentally friendly manner. Specifically, the defendants  falsely represented that the defendant company recycled electronic waste  \u201cproperly, right here in the U.S.\u201d They also stated that they would not send  the electronic waste overseas.\n\nThe defendants\u2019 misrepresentation induced  customers to enter into contracts or agreements with the defendants for  electronic waste disposal. Each victim paid the defendants to recycle their  electronic waste in accordance with the representations made by the defendants.  Contrary to their representations, the defendants sold the electronic waste  they received from customers to brokers for export overseas to the People\u2019s  Republic of China and other countries.\n\n\u201cThe defendants in  this case not only caused actual harm to the environment by shipping electronic  waste overseas for dumping, they defrauded their customers by falsely claiming  to be disposing of that waste in an environmentally safe way,\u201d said U.S.  Attorney John Walsh.\u00a0 \u201cAs cases like this  one show, federal investigators and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office can and will  reach beyond our country\u2019s borders to investigate crime and prosecute  wrongdoers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis prison sentence  and fine awarded to this CEO demonstrate that there are no shortcuts to  following U.S. export laws,\u201d said Kumar Kibble, special agent in charge of HSI  Denver.\u00a0 \u201cThis CEO also intentionally  deceived the public for years by falsely advertising an environmentally  friendly recycling business plan within the United States.\u00a0 Instead, he regularly exported tons of  obsolete and discarded electronic equipment containing toxic materials to third-world  countries, and took actions to illegally hide these practices from government  officials.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe defendants  claimed to safely recycle e-waste in the U.S., but regularly exported obsolete  and discarded electronic equipment with toxic materials to third-world  countries,\u201d said Jeff Martinez, Special Agent in Charge of EPA\u2019s criminal  enforcement office in Colorado.\u00a0 \u201cPollution  and greed respect no boundaries and EPA is committed to combating the illegal  traffic of e-waste, which poses particularly significant environmental health  risks in developing countries.\u201d\n\nThis case was investigated by U.S. Immigration  and Customs Enforcement\u2019s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), the  Environmental Protection Agency Criminal Investigation Division and the  Colorado Attorney General\u2019s Office, Special Prosecutions Unit.\n\nThe defendants were prosecuted by Assistant U.S.  Attorneys Suneeta Hazra and Valeria Spencer and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney  Lillian Alves.\n\n####",

Wang.\n\nU.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman stated: \u00a0\u201cAs alleged Zhongsan Liu conspired to obtain research scholar visas fraudulently for people whose actual purpose was not research but recruitment.\u00a0 Rather than helping to bring students to the U.S., Liu allegedly conspired to defraud this country\u2019s visa system to advance his efforts to attract U.S. experts to China.\u00a0 Thanks to the FBI, this alleged abuse of the visa system has been halted.\u201d\n\nAssistant Attorney General John C. Demers said:\u00a0 \u201cWe welcome foreign students and researchers, including from China, but we do not welcome visa fraud \u2013 especially on behalf of a government.\u00a0 We will continue to confront Chinese government attempts to subvert American law to advance its own interests in diverting U.S. research and know-how to China.\u201d\n\nFBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: \u00a0\u201cThe allegation that an employee of a foreign government has worked to mask the true purpose of an individual\u2019s presence in the United States isn\u2019t news to the FBI.\u00a0 This alleged behavior should be another alarm bell that foreign governments are constantly working to exploit research work being conducted throughout the United States.\u00a0 Not everyone shares the honest goal of conducting open research to benefit society as a whole.\u00a0 This case is another example of the pervasive and organized effort, in this instance an allegedly flat-out illegal one, to fulfill a top priority of collecting information to advantage a foreign adversary.\u00a0 Putting a halt to Mr. Liu\u2019s alleged actions are an important and significant step to highlighting these activities.\u00a0 The FBI New York, along with our intelligence community partners, will continue to disrupt the behavior when it is detected.\u201d\n\nAccording to the allegations in the Complaint unsealed in Manhattan federal court[1]:\n\nFrom approximately 2017, up to and including September 2019, LIU participated in a conspiracy to fraudulently procure U.S. visas for employees of the government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (the \u201cPRC Government\u201d).\u00a0 LIU operates the New York office of the China Association for International Exchange of Personnel (\u201cCAIEP-NY\u201d).\u00a0 CAIEP-NY is a PRC Government agency that, among other things, engages in talent-recruitment for the benefit of the PRC.\u00a0 In particular, CAIEP recruits U.S. scientists, academics, engineers, and other experts to work in China.\n\nLIU worked with others, including other PRC Government employees in the United States, to fraudulently procure J-1 Research Scholar visas for a CAIEP-NY employee (\u201cCC-1\u201d) and a prospective CAIEP-NY employee (\u201cthe CAIEP-NY Hire\u201d).\u00a0 The J-1 Research Scholar visa program permits foreign nationals to come to the United States for the primary purpose of conducting research at a corporate research facility, museum, library, university, or other research institution.\n\nIn or about April 2018, CC-1 applied for and received a J-1 visa to conduct research at a particular U.S. university (\u201cUniversity-1\u201d) located outside New York.\u00a0 Although CC-1 represented to the U.S. Government that she was entering the United States for the primary purpose of conducting research at University-1, CC-1\u2019s actual purpose in the United States consisted of performing full-time talent-recruitment work at CAIEP-NY.\u00a0 LIU helped CC-1 take measures to enhance her false appearance as a Research Scholar at University-1 by, among other things, directing CC-1 to report to University-1 upon her arrival in the United States; ensuring that CC-1 obtained a driver\u2019s license in the state where University-1 is located; and instructing CC-1 to periodically visit University-1 while working full-time at CAIEP-NY.\n\nIn addition, LIU attempted to enable the CAIEP-NY Hire to obtain a J-1 Research Scholar visa under false pretenses.\u00a0 In particular, LIU reached out to contacts at multiple U.S. universities in order to arrange for a university to invite the CAIEP-NY Hire to come to the United States as a J-1 Research Scholar.\u00a0 In truth and in fact, however, LIU intended that the CAIEP-NY Hire\u2019s primary purpose in the United States would consist of engaging full-time in the talent-recruitment work of CAIEP-NY.\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\n\nLIU, 57, of Fort Lee, New Jersey, is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit visa fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.\u00a0 The maximum potential sentence in this case is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the judge.\n\nMr. Berman praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI, and thanked the U.S. Department of State, Department of Homeland Security - Homeland Security Investigations, and the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section of the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s National Security Division for their assistance.\n\nThis case is being handled by the Office\u2019s Terrorism and International Narcotics Unit.\u00a0 Assistant United States Attorney Gillian Grossman is in charge of the prosecution.\n\nThe charges contained in the Complaint are merely accusations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\n\n[1]As the introductory phrase signifies, the entirety of the text of the Complaint and the descriptions of the Complaint constitute only allegations, and every fact described should be treated as an allegation.",

            "article_text": "Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and George Venizelos, the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d), announced today the filing of charges against YUDONG ZHU, XING YANG, and YE LI, three researchers who worked on improving MRI technology at a university in New York, New York, but who also had undisclosed affiliations with a Chinese company performing the same type of research. The research at the university was funded by a multi-million dollar federal grant from the National Institutes of Health. The defendants are each charged with one count of commercial bribery in connection with a conspiracy to receive payments from the Chinese company and a Chinese government-supported research institution in exchange for providing non-public information about research they conducted at the university. ZHU is also charged with lying about conflicts of interest in connection with the federal research grant. ZHU and YANG were arrested at their residences in New York yesterday, and LI is believed to have flown to China before charges were brought. ZHU and YANG will be presented later today in Manhattan federal court before U.S. Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn.\n\nManhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said: \u201cAs alleged, this is a case of inviting and paying for foxes in the henhouse. These defendants allegedly colluded with representatives from a Chinese governmental entity and a direct competitor of the university for which they worked to illegally acquire NIH-funded research for the benefit of those entities, as described in the complaint. The defendants also allegedly deceived the university and others about their professional allegiances to competing Chinese interests. The acquisition of federally funded research for the benefit of these Chinese entities is a serious crime and will not be tolerated by this Office.\u201d\n\nFBI Assistant Director-in-Charge George Venizelos said: \u201cAs alleged, while in the United States, these defendants conducted important research partially funded by the federal government to advance important MRI technology. Instead of working exclusively for a New York research institution, the defendants took bribes to acquire research for the benefit of both a Chinese competitor and a Chinese government institution. Protecting our nation\u2019s technology and intellectual property against these types of thefts remains one of the FBI\u2019s top priorities.\u201d\n\nAccording to the allegations in the Complaint unsealed today in Manhattan federal court:\n\nIn 2008, a university research medical center located in New York, New York (the \u201cUniversity\u201d) hired ZHU, an accomplished researcher and innovator in the field of magnetic resonance imaging (\u201cMRI\u201d) technology, to teach and conduct research related to innovations in MRI technology. ZHU came to the University, in large part, to use a specific University laboratory that possessed highly specialized equipment to test MRI innovations.\n\nIn 2010, ZHU caused the University to apply for and receive a grant from the National Institutes of Health (\u201cNIH\u201d) that provided millions of dollars in funding over a five-year period for ZHU\u2019s research relating to improving the imaging capability of MRI equipment (the \u201cNIH Grant\u201d). After ZHU started his research pursuant to the NIH Grant, he arranged for YANG and LI to move to New York from China to work with him in 2011 and 2012, respectively.\n\nWhile working for the University, ZHU, YANG, and LI each had undisclosed affiliations with United Imaging Healthcare (\u201cUnited Imaging\u201d), a Chinese medical imaging company, and the Shenzen Institute of Advanced Technology (\u201cSIAT\u201d), a Chinese government-sponsored research institute. When ZHU arranged for YANG and LI to work with him at the University, ZHU also arranged for them to receive certain financial benefits from a co-conspirator (\u201cCC-1\u201d) who was an executive with United Imaging and who was also affiliated with SIAT. For example, ZHU arranged for CC-1 to pay for YANG\u2019s tuition at a graduate school in New York, New York that was affiliated with the University, and LI\u2019s rental apartment. CC-1 also paid for YANG and LI\u2019s travel between China and New York while they worked at the University.\n\nIn addition, the University recently discovered that during their employment at the University, ZHU, YANG, and LI each maintained an e-mail address that included the domain \u201cunited-imaging.com\u201d. The University also obtained a United Imaging employee registration for LI, which included his signature dated September 27, 2012. ZHU, YANG, and LI concealed from, and failed to disclose, these payments from and relationships with competing research entities in China.\n\nYANG has stated that while working on the NIH Grant at the University, he also shared with individuals at United Imaging the research results from his and ZHU\u2019s work at the University that was conducted pursuant to the NIH Grant. Through an examination of University e-mail accounts, the University learned that from August 2011 through January 2013, individuals with e-mail addresses that included the \u201cunited-imaging.com\u201d domain corresponded with ZHU and YANG regarding issues related to MRI equipment prototypes, experiments, and project updates. These e-mails were sent to and/or from accounts including ZHU\u2019s personal Gmail account, his United Imaging email address, and YANG\u2019s Hotmail account.\n\nZHU also had other material conflicts of interest that he concealed from the University. ZHU owned a patent related to MRI technology, the value of which would be directly impacted by his NIH Grant research. In addition, at the same time that he was leading the research for the NIH Grant, ZHU, along with CC-1, was leading a similar research project in China related to MRI technology that was funded by a grant from the Chinese government. ZHU and CC-1 were also part of the same research team at SIAT. The 2011-2012 annual report for a certain division of SIAT included photographs of ZHU and CC-1 as members of its MRI Research Team. In financial interest disclosure forms that the University required ZHU to complete in connection with the NIH Grant, ZHU failed to disclose, and falsely answered, questions regarding these outside affiliations and financial conflicts of interest.\n\nZHU, 44, of Scarsdale, New York, YANG, 31, of Hartsdale, New York, and LI, 31, of Hartsdale, New York, are each charged with one count of commercial bribery conspiracy, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.\n\nZHU is also charged with one count of falsification of records in connection with the NIH grant, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.\n\nMr. Bharara praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI.\n\nThe prosecution of this case is being handled by the Office\u2019s Complex Frauds Unit. Assistant United States Attorneys Christian Everdell and Zachary Feingold are in charge of the prosecution.\n\nThe charges contained in the Complaint are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\n\nU.S. v.

            "article_text": "A Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) operative, Yanjun Xu, aka Qu Hui, aka Zhang Hui, has been arrested and charged with conspiring and attempting to commit economic espionage and steal trade secrets from multiple U.S. aviation and aerospace companies.\u00a0 Xu was extradited to the United States yesterday.The charges were announced today by Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio Benjamin C. Glassman, Assistant Director Bill Priestap of the FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Division, and Special Agent in Charge Angela L. Byers of the FBI\u2019s Cincinnati Division.\u201cThis indictment alleges that a Chinese intelligence officer sought to steal trade secrets and other sensitive information from an American company that leads the way in aerospace,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Demers.\u00a0 \u201cThis case is not an isolated incident.\u00a0 It is part of an overall economic policy of developing China at American expense.\u00a0 We cannot tolerate a nation\u2019s stealing our firepower and the fruits of our brainpower.\u00a0 We will not tolerate a nation that reaps what it does not sow.\u201d\u201cInnovation in aviation has been a hallmark of life and industry in the United States since the Wright brothers first designed gliders in Dayton more than a century ago,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Glassman.\u00a0 \u201cU.S. aerospace companies invest decades of time and billions of dollars in research.\u00a0 This is the American way.\u00a0 In contrast, according to the indictment, a Chinese intelligence officer tried to acquire that same, hard-earned innovation through theft.\u00a0 This case shows that federal law enforcement authorities can not only detect and disrupt such espionage, but can also catch its perpetrators.\u00a0 The defendant will now face trial in federal court in Cincinnati.\u201d\"This unprecedented extradition of a Chinese intelligence officer exposes the Chinese government's direct oversight of economic espionage against the United States,\u201d said Assistant Director Priestap.Yanjun Xu is a Deputy Division Director with the MSS\u2019s Jiangsu State Security Department, Sixth Bureau.\u00a0 The MSS is the intelligence and security agency for China and is responsible for counter-intelligence, foreign intelligence and political security. \u00a0MSS has broad powers in China to conduct espionage both domestically and abroad.Xu was arrested in Belgium on April 1, pursuant to a federal complaint, and then indicted by a federal grand jury in the Southern District of Ohio.\u00a0 The government unsealed the charges today, following his extradition to the United States.\u00a0 The four-count indictment charges Xu with conspiring and attempting to commit economic espionage and theft of trade secrets.\n\n***\n\nAccording to the indictment:Beginning in at least December 2013 and continuing until his arrest, Xu targeted certain companies inside and outside the United States that are recognized as leaders in the aviation field. This included GE Aviation. He identified experts who worked for these companies and recruited them to travel to China, often initially under the guise of asking them to deliver a university presentation. Xu and others paid the experts\u2019 travel costs and provided stipends.\n\n***\n\nAn indictment is merely a formal charge that a defendant has committed a violation of criminal law and is not evidence of guilt. \u00a0Every defendant is presumed innocent until, and unless, proven guilty.The maximum statutory penalty for conspiracy and attempt to commit economic espionage is 15 years of incarceration. \u00a0The maximum for conspiracy and attempt to commit theft of trade secrets is 10 years. \u00a0The charges also carry potential financial penalties. \u00a0The maximum statutory sentence is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes. \u00a0If convicted of any offense, a defendant\u2019s sentence will be determined by the court based on the advisory Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.This investigation was conducted by the FBI\u2019s Cincinnati Division, and substantial support was provided by the FBI Legal Attach\u00e9\u2019s Office in Brussels.\u00a0 The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in obtaining and coordinating the extradition of Xu, and Belgian authorities provided significant assistance in securing the arrest and facilitating the surrender of Xu from Belgium.Assistant Attorney General Demers and U.S. Attorney Glassman commended the investigation of this case by the FBI and the assistance of the Belgian authorities in the arrest and extradition of Xu.\u00a0 Mr. Demers and Mr. Glassman also commended the cooperation of GE Aviation throughout this investigation. The cooperation and GE Aviation\u2019s internal controls protected GE Aviation\u2019s proprietary information.The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Timothy S. Mangan and Emily N. Glatfelter of the Southern District of Ohio, and Trial Attorneys Thea D. R. Kendler and Amy E. Larson of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.",

            "article_text": "SANTA ANA, California\u2013 Following the arrests this morning of three defendants who allegedly operated \u201cbirth tourism\u201d outfits that catered to Chinese clients, federal authorities today unsealed indictments that charge a total of 19 people linked to three schemes that operated across Southern California and charged clients tens of thousands of dollars to help them give birth in the United States.\n\nThe indictments charge operators and clients of three \u201cmaternity house\u201d or \u201cbirthing house\u201d schemes that were dismantled in March 2015 when federal agents executed 35 search warrants, which resulted from international undercover operations.\n\nThe 17 cases unsealed today contain the first-ever federal criminal charges brought against operators and customers of birth tourism businesses. The birth tourism operations not only committed widespread immigration fraud and engaged in international money laundering, they also defrauded property owners when leasing the apartments and houses used in their birth tourism schemes, according to the indictments.\n\nThe indictments describe birth tourism schemes in which foreign nationals, mostly from China, applied for visitor visas to come to the United States and lied about the length of their trips, where they would stay, and the purposes of their trips \u2013 which were to come to the U.S. for three months to give birth so their children would receive U.S. birthright citizenship.\n\nAccording to the indictments that charge the operators of the schemes, they coached their Chinese customers how to pass the U.S. Consulate interview in China by falsely stating that they were going to stay in the U.S. for only two weeks. Their clients were also coached to trick U.S. Customs at ports of entry by wearing loose clothing that would conceal their pregnancies. The indictments also allege that the customers were directed to fly to Hawaii from China \u2013 instead of directly to Los Angeles \u2013 because it was easier to get through U.S. Customs in Hawaii. The indictments allege that many of the Chinese birth tourism customers failed to pay all of the medical costs associated with their hospital births, and the debts were referred to collection.\n\n\u201cThese cases allege a wide array of criminal schemes that sought to defeat our immigration laws \u2013 laws that welcome foreign visitors so long as they are truthful about their intentions when entering the country,\u201d said United States Attorney Nick Hanna. \u201cStatements by the operators of these birthing houses show contempt for the United States, while they were luring clients with the power and prestige of U.S. citizenship for their children. Some of the wealthy clients of these businesses also showed blatant contempt for the U.S. by ignoring court orders directing them to stay in the country to assist with the investigation and by skipping out on their unpaid hospital bills.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s way of life is not for sale,\u201d said Joseph Macias, Special Agent in Charge of Homeland Security Investigations Los Angeles. \u201cHSI will aggressively target those who would make a mockery of our laws and our values to benefit and enrich themselves. No one needs to be reminded about the national security and public safety implications of visa fraud and the crimes associated with it. Anyone who would exploit our nation\u2019s generosity and our legal immigration system should be on notice \u2013 they may end up being the ones to pay a very steep price.\u201d\n\n\u201cReceiving a tourist visa from the United States Government is a privilege, not a right,\u201d stated IRS Criminal Investigation Acting Special Agent in Charge Bryant Jackson. \u201cThe indictments announced today confirm IRS Criminal Investigation\u2019s commitment to following the money \u2013 from China to the United States \u2013 to help identify the promoters of this alleged illegal international birth tourism scheme. Using cash, fabricated financial documents, and nominee names for the transfer of money from China to the U.S., the promoters attempted to further their lucrative birth tourism enterprise.\u201d\n\nThree indictments returned Wednesday by a federal grand jury charge the operators of large birth tourism operations based in Orange, Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties. Pursuant to this week\u2019s indictments, federal authorities this morning arrested three defendants: Dongyuan Li (\u674e\u51ac\u5a9b), 41, of Irvine; Michael Wei Yueh Liu (\u5218\u7ef4\u5cb3), 53, of Rancho Cucamonga; and Jing Dong (\u8463\u6676), 42, of Fontana. All three are charged with conspiracy to commit immigration fraud, international money laundering and identity theft. Liu is also charged with filing three false tax returns.\n\nAccording to the indictments charging the operators, all three businesses touted the benefits of giving birth in the U.S., rather than in China, with claims of the U.S. having \u201cthe most attractive nationality\u201d; \u201cbetter air\u201d and less pollution; \u201cpriority for jobs in U.S. government\u201d; superior educational resources, including \u201cfree education from junior high school to public high school\u201d; a more stable political situation; and the potential to \u201creceive your senior supplement benefits when you are living overseas.\u201d\n\nThe indictment naming Li alleges that she operated an Orange County-based business named You Win USA that advertised its \u201c100-person team\u201d in China and the U.S. had served more than 500 Chinese birth tourism customers. Li allegedly used 20 apartments in Irvine, charged each customer $40,000 to $80,000, and received $3 million in international wire transfers from China in just two years. The indictment details communications in which Li referred to U.S. immigration authorities as \u201cthe foreigners\u201d and also discussed whether to refund a downpayment because, once the customer found out \u201cthe baby is a girl, her husband arranged abortion for her.\u201d\n\n(The investigation into Li\u2019s operation led to another investigation, which resulted in criminal charges against the 20thperson to be charged in this matter. AttorneyKen Zhiyi Liangwas sentenced to 21 months in federal prison for helping material witnesses flee to China in violation of court orders.)\n\nAnother indictment filed this week charges Wen Rui Deng (\u9093\u6587\u745e), 65, a former Irvine resident who is believed to now be in China, with operating Star Baby Care, a Los Angeles County-based operation that is believed to have been the largest birth tourism scheme in the U.S. On its websites, Star Baby Care boasted that it was founded in 1999 as the \u201cnumber one designated maternity service to the pregnant mother from China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan,\u201d and had \u201cprovided services to 8,000 pregnant women (4,000 from China) since we established.\u201d The indictment alleges that Deng\u2019s scheme used 30 apartments in Rowland Heights and 10 properties in Irvine, including some houses. Deng\u2019s scheme served many customers alleged to be Chinese officials, including some associated with Chinese Central Television, China Telecom, Bank of China, and two local taxation bureaus.\n\nIn the third indictment filed this week, Liu and Dong are accused of operating USA Happy Baby Inc., a San Bernardino County-based company that charged \u201cVIP\u201d customers as much as $100,000. Using apartments in Rancho Cucamonga and Irvine, USA Happy Baby allegedly also served Chinese officials, including people associated with the Henan People\u2019s Radio Station in Zhengzhou, the Public Security Bureau in the Beijing Municipal Government, and the Harbin Medical University in Heilongjiang Province. Liu and USA Happy Baby are also charged with filing false tax returns that failed to report more than $1.9 million received over three years. The indictment also alleges that Liu and Dong used 14 different bank accounts to receive more than $3.4 million in international wire transfers from China during 2013 and 2014 alone.\n\nThere are 16 fugitive defendants whose indictments were unsealed today. They are:\n\nQiang Yan (\u95eb\u5f3a), 42, who is Dongyuan Li\u2019s husband, was indicted in December 2018 on three counts of visa fraud for filing an application for an \u201cO\u201d visa premised upon being an \u201calien of extraordinary ability,\u201d which falsely claimed that he had co-authored two books and attached fake copies of those books. The indictment naming his wife notes that when Yan was interviewed during a search of Li\u2019s multi-million-dollar residence in Irvine, he told the federal agents that his birth tourism business investment was \u201cchump change,\u201d because he had more than $10 million in his bank accounts in China.\n\nXiao Yan Liu (\u5218\u5c0f\u71d5), 39, who was indicted in November 2018 for two counts of visa fraud and one count of lying to federal law enforcement. According to her visa application, she was the \u201cChief Physician\u201d at the Henan Shangqiu Power Supply Company Staff Hospital.\n\nJun Xiao (\u8096\u4fca), 30, and LongJing Yi (\u6613\u73d1\u9759), 30, who were indicted in February 2018 on charges of conspiracy, visa fraud, obstruction of justice, and criminal contempt. According to their indictment, Xiao and Yi made false statements on their visa applications, namely that they would be staying in the United States for only 15 days. According to court documents in their case, Xiao and Yi paid only $4,600 of the $32,291 in hospital charges related to the birth of their baby. The indictments detail communications from Xiao after he had fled to China, where he continued to denigrate the Court\u2019s Order requiring him to stay in the U.S.: \u201cAnyway, I\u2019m already home. U.S. can\u2019t do anything to me.\u201d\n\nDongjiang He (\u8d3a\u4e1c\u6c5f), 46, was indicted in February 2018 for fleeing with his wife to China, in violation of a federal court order. On his visa application, He listed his occupation as \u201cGovernment\u201d and his position as \u201cProject Manager and Secretary General\u201d for the China Nonferrous Metals Techno Economic Research Institute, which is located in the Haidian District in Beijing. His wife, Zhichan Yu (\u4f59\u829d\u5a75), 40, also was indicted in February 2018 on charges of visa fraud, obstruction of justice, and contempt of court after fleeing to China in violation of a federal court order.\n\nJia Luo (\u7f57\u4f73), 30, was indicted in February 2018 for fleeing to China in violation of a federal court order. According to court documents, Luo lied on her visa application and lied to U.S. Customs officers in Hawaii when asked her if she was planning on having a baby in the United States.\n\nRenlong Chen (\u9648\u4eba\u9f99), 34, and his wife Wei Wang (\u738b\u4f1f), 33, were indicted in February 2018 for fleeing to China, in violation of federal court orders. Chen and Wang are accused of making false statements on their visa applications by stating they would be visiting the United States for only eight days, when they actually made arrangements to stay at a maternity house in Rancho Cucamonga for three months so that Wang could give birth in the United States.\n\nJie He (\u4f55\u6d01), 29, was indicted in February 2018 for fleeing to China in violation of federal court order. She allegedly made false statements on her visa application, including that she planned to stay in the United States for only 20 days, when she actually entered into a contract to pay approximately $50,000 to obtain a visa and stay in the United States for several months to give birth. According to court documents, Jie He told investigators that she flew into Las Vegas, rather than Los Angeles, because the Chinese maternity operator had advised her that it was easier to enter through Las Vegas.\n\nEryun Zhang (\u5f20\u5c14\u82b8), 25; her husband, Liang Ni (\u502a\u6881), 25; and her mother, Ji Xu (\u5f90\u6fc0), 50, were indicted in February 2018 for fleeing to China in violation of federal court orders. According to court documents, Ni admitted that, during an interview conducted at the U.S. Consulate in China, he falsely stated that the purpose of their trip was for their honeymoon, rather than the true reason for Zhang to give birth in the United States.\n\nChao Chen (\u9648\u8d85), 34, a partner in the You Win USA scheme, was indicted in December 2018 with one count of contempt of court for fleeing the U.S. while he was pending sentencing. Chen previously pleaded guilty to visa fraud, marriage fraud and tax fraud.\n\nJi Zhu (\u6731\u6d01), 31, who was indicted in March 2018 for one count of marriage fraud, for allegedly marrying a U.S. citizen to obtain U.S. citizenship, even though she really was married to Chao Chen. Zhu fled to China with Chao Chen, where they remain fugitives from justice.\n\nAn indictment contains allegations that a defendant has committed a crime. Every defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThe three defendants arrested this morning are expected to be arraigned on the indictments this afternoon in United States District Court in Santa Ana.\n\nThe federal investigation into Dongyuan Li\u2019s You Win USA scheme has resulted in seizure and/or forfeiture proceedings against three real properties with millions of dollars in equity, including her $2.1 million residence in Irvine; six vehicles, including four Mercedes Benz vehicles; more than $1 million from bank accounts; and many gold bars and coins.\n\nThese cases were investigated by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations and IRS Criminal Investigation. The Federal Bureau of Investigation participated in the investigation of USA Happy Baby and the material witnesses related to that scheme who fled to China. Local law enforcement authorities, including the Irvine Police Department and the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department, provided substantial assistance during execution of search warrants in 2015.\n\nThese cases are being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Charles E. Pell of the Santa Ana Branch Office.",

            "article_text": "CARBONDALE,\u00a0 Ill.\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0 A\u00a0 mathematics\u00a0 professor\u00a0 and\u00a0 researcher\u00a0 at\u00a0 Southern\u00a0 IllinoisUniversity\u00a0 \u2013 Carbondale (SIUC) is\u00a0 under federal indictment for grant fraud. Mingqing\u00a0 Xiao,\u00a0 59,of\u00a0 Makanda, Illinois,\u00a0 is\u00a0 accused\u00a0 of\u00a0 fraudulently\u00a0 obtaining\u00a0 $151,099\u00a0 in\u00a0 federal\u00a0 grantmoney\u00a0 from\u00a0 the\u00a0 National Science\u00a0 Foundation\u00a0 (NSF)\u00a0 by\u00a0 concealing\u00a0 support\u00a0 he\u00a0 was\u00a0 receivingfrom\u00a0 an\u00a0 arm\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Chinese government and a Chinese public university. Xiao is charged withtwo counts of wire fraud and one count of making a false statement.The prosecution is part of the Justice Department\u2019s ongoing China Initiative. Led by theDepartment\u2019s National Security Division (NSD), the China Initiative is an effort to safeguardAmerican intellectual property and research programs and counter the multi-faceted threat posed bythe PRC government to U.S. national security.\n\nWhile\u00a0 the\u00a0 Chinese\u00a0 government\u00a0 maintains\u00a0 ambitious\u00a0 strategic\u00a0 goals\u00a0 to\u00a0 dominate\u00a0 certainglobal economic sectors, its ability to achieve those goals is hampered by its lack of domesticinnovation. Comments made by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang at a Communist Party gathering in March2019 underscore this dilemma: \u201cOur capacity for innovation is not strong and our weakness in termsof core technologies for key fields remains a salient problem.\u201d\u00b9\u00a0 Given this identified weakness,China resorts to various forms of economic aggression to achieve its strategic goals, includinghacking, theft, espionage, and recruiting \u201cnon-traditional collectors\u201d in academia to acquire U.S.technologies and intellectual property. The China Initiative works with academia and privateindustry to combat the PRC government\u2019s diverse counterintelligence threats.\n\n\u201cAgain,\u00a0 an\u00a0 American\u00a0 professor\u00a0 stands\u00a0 accused\u00a0 of\u00a0 enabling\u00a0 the\u00a0 Chinese\u00a0 government\u2019sefforts\u00a0 to corruptly benefit from U.S. research funding by lying about his obligations to, andsupport from, an arm of the Chinese government and a Chinese public university,\u201d said John C.Demers, Assistant Attorney General for National Security. \u201cHonesty and transparency about fundingsources lie at the heart of the scientific research enterprise. They enable U.S. agencies todistribute scarce grants for scientific\u00a0 research\u00a0 fairly\u00a0 and\u00a0 equitably.\u00a0 And\u00a0 they\u00a0 allow\u00a0 otherresearchers\u00a0 to\u00a0 evaluate\u00a0 potential conflicts of interest and conflicts of commitment. Whenresearchers fall short of fulfilling these core academic\u00a0 values\u00a0 in\u00a0 ways\u00a0 that\u00a0 violate\u00a0 thelaw,\u00a0 the\u00a0 Department\u00a0 stands\u00a0 ready\u00a0 to\u00a0 investigate\u00a0 and prosecute.\u201d1Source:http://www.china.org.cn/china/NPC_CPPCC_2019/2019-03/16/content_74578930.htm\n\n\u201cWe know that China exploits American universities to further the aims of the Chinese CommunistParty,\u201d\u00a0 said\u00a0 U.S.\u00a0 Attorney\u00a0 Steven\u00a0 D.\u00a0 Weinhoeft.\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s\u00a0 one\u00a0 reason\u00a0 why\u00a0 the\u00a0 NationalScience Foundation requires applicants to disclose all sources of support, including foreign ties,as a condition to receive federal grant funding. Prosecutions like this one play a critical role,not just in protecting American\u00a0 investments\u00a0 in\u00a0 academic\u00a0 research\u00a0 from\u00a0 foreign\u00a0 exploitation,but\u00a0 also\u00a0 in\u00a0 combating\u00a0 the growing threat that China poses to our national security.\u201d\u201cThe\u00a0 FBI\u00a0 takes\u00a0 seriously\u00a0 its\u00a0 commitment\u00a0 to\u00a0 work\u00a0 with\u00a0 our\u00a0 partners\u00a0 in\u00a0 academia\u00a0 toprotect\u00a0 U.S. research\u00a0 funded\u00a0 grants,\u201d\u00a0 said\u00a0 Sean\u00a0 M.\u00a0 Cox,\u00a0 FBI-Springfield\u2019s\u00a0 Special\u00a0 Agentin\u00a0 Charge.\u00a0 \u201cThis investigation, like so many others, should serve as a reminder that failure tobe truthful and transparent on an application for U.S. funded grants is a violation of the law. Inthis case the applicant allegedly failed to disclose his affiliation with China. Individuals whofail to disclose their affiliation with any foreign nation will be held accountable.\u201d\n\nAccording\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 indictment,\u00a0 Xiao\u00a0 has\u00a0 worked\u00a0 in\u00a0 SIUC\u2019s\u00a0 mathematics\u00a0 department\u00a0 since2000, focusing his research on partial differential equations, control theory, optimization theory,dynamical systems, and computational science. In that position, Xiao (who is an American citizen)allegedly applied for and received NSF grant funds for a project set to run from 2019 to 2022without informing NSF about another, overlapping grant he had already received from the NaturalScience Foundation of Guangdong Province, China. Xiao also allegedly failed to inform NSF that hewas on the payroll of\u00a0 Shenzhen\u00a0 University,\u00a0 a\u00a0 public\u00a0 university\u00a0 in\u00a0 Guangdong\u00a0 Province,\u00a0 andthat\u00a0 he\u00a0 had\u00a0 already committed to teaching and conducting research at Shenzhen University from2018 to 2023.\n\nThe indictment further alleges that in March 2019, while his NSF grant proposal was still pending,Xiao submitted another grant proposal to the Natural Science Foundation of China. According to theindictment, Xiao allegedly applied for the funds as an employee of Shenzhen University and did notdisclose the new Chinese proposal to NSF. Xiao is charged with falsely certifying to SIUC that hisNSF grant proposal was true, complete, and accurate.\n\nBefore\u00a0 awarding\u00a0 the\u00a0 grant,\u00a0 NSF\u00a0 questioned\u00a0 Xiao\u00a0 about\u00a0 any\u00a0 current\u00a0 or\u00a0 pending\u00a0 fundingfrom \u201cworldwide sources,\u201d including specifically whether he held any position outside the UnitedStates or had obtained funding from any non-US funding sources. The indictment accuses Xiao offalsely reporting to NSF that he had nothing else to disclose.\n\nThe\u00a0 defendant\u2019s\u00a0 initial\u00a0 court\u00a0 appearance\u00a0 has\u00a0 not\u00a0 yet\u00a0 been\u00a0 scheduled.\u00a0 If\u00a0 convicted,\u00a0 Xiaofaces\u00a0 a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison on each count of wire fraud and 5 years in prisonfor making a false statement. All three charges are also punishable by a fine of up to $250,000.

            "article_text": "CINCINNATI \u2013 The first Chinese intelligence agent ever to be extradited to the United States to stand trial was convicted today by a federal jury in Cincinnati.\n\n\n\nYanjun Xu was found guilty on all counts, including conspiring to and attempting to commit economic espionage and stealing trade secrets.\n\n\n\nThe verdict was announced today following a trial that began on Oct. 19 before U.S. District Judge Timothy S. Black. Closing arguments concluded Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe jury, by its guilty verdict here today, held Xu accountable for his classic spy techniques,\u201d said Acting U.S. Attorney Vipal J. Patel. \u201cXu conspired to commit economic espionage on behalf of the Chinese government, and he tried to steal the valuable innovation and trade secrets of industry-leading American aviation technology companies.\u00a0This Office will continue to seek to protect American innovation and hold accountable those who attempt to steal our nation\u2019s science and technology, regardless of status or affiliation, whether civilian, military, or spy.\u201d\n\n\u201cInvestigating, arresting, and successfully prosecuting an intelligence officer from the Chinese Ministry of State Security is a victory for the American people and the U.S. intelligence community,\u201d stated FBI Cincinnati Special Agent in Charge J. William Rivers. \u201cThe Chinese Communist government, which tasked Xu, is continuing to operate other spies, hackers, and intelligence officers who are intent on stealing advanced technologies and exploiting U.S. businesses innovations. Government and private industry must strengthen our partnerships to protect our advancements and our national security.\u201d\n\n\n\nXu is a deputy division director at the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS), which is the intelligence and security agency for China.\n\n\n\nAccording to court documents and trial testimony, beginning in at least December 2013, Xu targeted specific companies in the United States and abroad that are recognized as leaders in the field of aviation. He identified individuals who worked for the companies and recruited them to travel to China, often initially under the guise that they were traveling to give a presentation at a university. Xu and others paid the individuals stipends on top of covering travel costs.\n\n\n\nAccording to today\u2019s conviction, Xu attempted to steal technology related to GE Aviation\u2019s exclusive composite aircraft engine fan \u2013 which no other company in the world has been able to duplicate \u2013 to benefit the Chinese state.\n\n\n\nIn March 2017, a GE Aviation employee in Cincinnati was solicited to give a report at a university in China. The employee traveled to China two months later to present at the university and was introduced to Xu. Xu and others paid the employee\u2019s travel expenses and a stipend.\n\n\n\nIn January 2018, Xu requested \u201csystem specification, design process\u201d information from the employee and \u2013 with the cooperation of the company, who was working with the FBI \u2013 the employee emailed a two-page document from the company that included a label that warned about the disclosure of proprietary information.\n\n\n\nIn February 2018, Xu began discussing with the employee the possibility of meeting in Europe during one of the employee\u2019s business trips and asked the employee to send a copy of the file directory for his company-issued computer.\n\n\n\nXu traveled to Belgium on April 1, 2018 to meet with the employee and was arrested at that time.\n\n\n\nThe Department of Justice Criminal Division\u2019s Office of International Affairs secured Xu\u2019s extradition to the United States, with valuable assistance provided by the government of Belgium, as well as the Belgian Federal Police.\n\n\n\nEconomic espionage is punishable by up to 15 years in prison and a fine of up to $5 million. Theft of trade secrets carries a potential maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.\n\n\n\nVipal J. Patel, Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio; Matthew G. Olsen, Assistant Attorney General of the Department of Justice\u2019s National Security Division; and J. William Rivers, Special Agent in Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cincinnati Division; announced today\u2019s guilty verdict. Assistant Deputy Criminal Chief Timothy S. Mangan, Deputy Criminal Chief Emily N. Glatfelter, and Trial Attorney Matthew J. McKenzie from the Department of Justice\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section represented the United States in this case. Acting U.S. Attorney Patel commended the integral cooperation of GE Aviation throughout the investigation and subsequent prosecution.\n\n\n\n# # #",

Carlin and U.S. Attorney A. Lee Bentley, III for the Middle District of Florida made the announcement after Yu was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Roy B. Dalton, Jr.\n\nAccording to the plea agreement, from at least 2002 to February 2014, at the direction of co-conspirators working for Harbin Engineering University (HEU, a PRC-controlled entity) in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Yu obtained systems and components for marine submersible vehicles from companies in the U.S. She then illegally exported those items to the PRC for use by her co-conspirators in the development of marine submersible vehicles including unmanned underwater vehicles, remotely operated vehicles and autonomous underwater vehicles for HEU and other state-controlled entities. Yu illegally exported items by failing to file Electronic Export Information (EEI), as required by U.S. law and by also filing false EEI. Yu completed and caused the completion of export-related documents in which she significantly undervalued the items that she had exported and provided false end user information for those items.\n\nThis case was investigated by the FBI, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations, the IRS Criminal Investigation Division, and the NCIS. It was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel C. Irick of the Middle District of Florida and Trial Attorneys David C. Recker and Thea D. R.

            "article_text": "BOSTON \u2013 The former men\u2019s soccer coach at the University of California \u2013 Los Angeles (UCLA), was sentenced today in connection with his involvement in a scheme to use bribery and fraud to facilitate the admission of applicants to UCLA.\n\nJorge Salcedo, 48, of Dana Point, Calif., was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Indira Talwani to eight months in prison, one year of supervised release and forfeiture in the amount of $200,000. In January 2021, Salcedo agreed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit federal programs bribery.\n\nIn 2016, Salcedo agreed with William \u201cRick\u201d Singer, Ali Khosroshahin \u2013 a former head coach of women\u2019s soccer at the University of Southern California \u2013 and others to facilitate the admission of a student to UCLA as a purported women\u2019s soccer recruit. Salcedo emailed the UCLA women\u2019s soccer coaches the student\u2019s transcript, test scores, and a fake soccer profile that he had received from Singer and Khosroshahin. When UCLA compliance officers questioned how the applicant had been discovered and whether she actually played soccer, Salcedo created a fake backstory, resulting in her subsequent admission as a recruited walk-on for the women\u2019s soccer team. Salcedo was paid a bribe of $100,000 for his actions.\n\nIn 2018, Salcedo agreed with Singer and Khosroshahin to \u201crecruit\u201d the son of another client of Singer\u2019s to the UCLA men\u2019s soccer team despite the fact that the student did not play soccer competitively. In the recruitment paperwork, Salcedo falsely reported that he had seen the student play in China and that he planned to offer him a 25% scholarship. The student was subsequently admitted to UCLA as a student-athlete on the men\u2019s soccer team with a 25% scholarship. In exchange, Salcedo accepted a $100,000 bribe from Singer.\n\nSalcedo also agreed with Singer to recruit another student in return for $100,000.\n\nSinger and Khosroshahin previously pleaded guilty in connection with their roles in the offense. They have not yet been sentenced.\n\nCase information, including the status of each defendant, charging documents and plea agreements are available here: https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/investigations-college-admissions-and-testing-bribery-scheme.\n\nActing United States Attorney Nathaniel R. Mendell; Joseph R. Bonavolonta, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Boston Field Division; Ramsey E. Covington, Special Agent in Charge of the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s Criminal Investigations in Boston; and Mark Deckett, Resident Agent in Charge of the Department of Education, Office of Inspector General made the announcement today. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Justin D. O\u2019Connell, Leslie A. Wright, and Kristen A. Kearney of Mendell\u2019s Criminal Division prosecuted the case.\n\nThe details contained in the court documents are allegations and the remaining defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.",

Lenzner and Special Agent in Charge James R. Mancuso of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Baltimore.\n\nAccording to his plea agreement, between March 2009 and May 2018, Wahab sold approximately 18,306 DVDs or DVD sets, with a total retail value of $315,761.44.\u00a0 Wahab knowingly sold counterfeit DVDs containing copyrighted works belonging to ABC Studios/Disney, Anchor Bay Entertainment; Disney; Fox; HBO Home Entertainment; Lionsgate; MGM; Netflix; Paramount; Sony; Universal; Warner Brothers; and BeachBody, LLC.\n\nIn 2017, representatives from the Motion Picture Association (MPA) identified a seller on an Internet marketplace selling fraudulent DVDs at a discounted rate.\u00a0 MPA purchased an item and analyzed the DVD upon receipt.\u00a0 Although the packaging was nearly indistinguishable from legitimate copies, the product was fraudulent. \u00a0Records obtained from the Internet marketplace revealed the seller had made over 10,000 sales of DVD or Blu-Ray discs of popular movies, television shows, or fitness programs between August 2016 and April 2018.\n\nUndercover law enforcement officers subsequently conducted purchases from the seller, including DVD titles of \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d,\u201cThe Fate of the Furious,\u201d \u201cFinding Dory,\u201d and among other popular titles.\u00a0 The DVDs purchased by the undercover officers were provided to MPA representatives for authentication and were determined to be counterfeit.\u00a0 Law enforcement determined that Wahab was the individual purchasing the counterfeit items from China and reselling the fraudulent items in the United States.\n\nDuring the nine years when Wahab was engaged in the sale of counterfeit DVDs, he made approximately $241,370.58 from these sales.\u00a0 As gross proceeds from Wahab\u2019s criminal activity, Judge Xinis ordered forfeiture in this amount.\u00a0 Separately, the Court also ordered restitution in the amount of $165,961.53 in order to compensate the copyright holder victims whose copyright infringed titles the Defendant was selling online.\n\nActing United States Attorney Jonathan F. Lenzner commended HSI for its work in the investigation and thanked the MPA for its substantial assistance in this matter.\u00a0 Mr. Lenzner thanked Assistant U.S. Attorneys Rajeev R.

Demers, U.S. Attorney Grant C. Jaquith for the Northern District of New York, Assistant Director John Brown of the FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Division and Special Agent in Charge James N. Hendricks of the FBI\u2019s Albany Field Office made the announcement.\n\nAccording to the 14-count indictment, Zheng, while employed at GE Power & Water in Schenectady, New York as an engineer specializing in sealing technology, exploited his access to GE\u2019s files by stealing multiple electronic files, including proprietary files involving design models, engineering drawings, configuration files, and material specifications having to do with various components and testing systems associated with GE gas and steam turbines.\u00a0 Zheng e-mailed and transferred many of the stolen GE files to his business partner, Chinese businessman Zhaoxi Zhang, who was located in China.\u00a0 Zheng and Zhang used the stolen GE trade secrets to advance their own business interests in two Chinese companies - Liaoning Tianyi Aviation Technology Co., Ltd. (LTAT) and Nanjing Tianyi Avi Tech Co. Ltd. (NTAT), companies which research, develop, and manufacture parts for turbines.\n\nThe indictment also alleges that Zheng and Zhang conspired to commit economic espionage, as the thefts of GE\u2019s trade secrets surrounding various turbine technologies were done knowing and intending that the thefts would benefit the People\u2019s Republic of China and one or more foreign instrumentalities, including LTAT, NTAT, Shenyang Aerospace University, Shenyang Aeroengine Research Institute, and Huaihai Institute of Technology.\u00a0 The defendants, through LTAT and NTAT, received financial and other support from the Chinese government and coordinated with Chinese government officials to enter into research agreements with Chinese state-owned institutions to develop turbine technologies.\n\n\u201cThe indictment alleges a textbook example of the Chinese government\u2019s strategy to rob American companies of their intellectual property and to replicate their products in Chinese factories, enabling Chinese companies to replace the American company first in the Chinese market and later worldwide,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Demers.\u00a0 \u201cWe will not stand idly by while the world\u2019s second-largest economy engages in state-sponsored theft.\u00a0 As part of the Attorney General\u2019s China Initiative, we will partner with the private sector to hold responsible those who violate our laws, and we urge China\u2019s leaders to join responsible nations and to act with honesty and integrity when competing in the global marketplace.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs alleged, the thefts of trade secrets to benefit the People\u2019s Republic of China are serious crimes against the victimized company and our country,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Jaquith. \u201cBoth fair competition and incentivized innovation require that American companies be able to rely on the secrecy of technological advances forged through their talent and tenacity.\u00a0 When technology is taken through treachery, we will continue to work with the National Security Division and the FBI to prosecute the perpetrators.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerican businesses spend many hours and large amounts of money developing unique technology.\u00a0 When such technology is stolen it can be devastating to U.S. businesses and can result in American workers losing jobs,\u201d said FBI Assistant Director Brown. \u00a0\u201cChina continues to support behavior that violates the rule of law. \u00a0This case demonstrates the FBI will continue to pursue China's efforts to steal American technology.\u201d\n\n\u201cEconomic espionage and the theft of trade secrets have a profound impact on our companies and communities,\u201d said FBI Special Agent in Charge Hendricks.\u00a0 \u201cWe view this as a grave threat to our economic and national security and the FBI will work tirelessly to prevent the loss of American technology and American jobs.\u201d\n\nZheng was arraigned today in Albany, New York, before United States Magistrate Judge Christian F. Hummel, and released with conditions pending a trial before United States District Judge Mae A. D\u2019Agostino.\n\nThe economic espionage counts (Counts One, Three, Four, Seven, Eight and Eleven) carry a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison, a fine of up to $5,000,000, and a term of supervised release of up to three years.\u00a0 The trade secrets theft counts (Counts Two, Five, Six, Nine, Ten, Twelve and Thirteen) carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000, and a term of supervised release of up to three years.\u00a0 Count Fourteen of the indictment, which charges Zheng with making false statements to the FBI during a voluntary interview, carries a maximum sentence of 5 years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000, and a term of supervised release of up to three years.\n\nThe charges in the indictment are merely accusations. \u00a0The defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\n\nThis case is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Rick Belliss, and National Security Division Trial Attorneys Jason McCullough and Matthew Chang.",

Shapiro, Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs.\n\nThe Charges\n\nToday in the District of Connecticut, the Justice Department filed a three-count criminal information charging UTC, PWC and HSC.\u00a0 Count One charges PWC with violating the Arms Export Control Act in connection with the illegal export of defense articles to China for the Z-10 helicopter.\u00a0 Count Two charges PWC, UTC and HSC with making false statements to the U.S. government in their belated disclosures relating to the illegal exports.\u00a0 Count Three charges PWC and HSC with failure to timely inform the U.S. government of exports of defense articles to China.\n\nWhile PWC has pleaded guilty to Counts One and Two, the Justice Department has recommended that prosecution of UTC and HSC on Count Two, and PWC and HSC on Count Three be deferred for two years, provided the companies abide by the terms of a deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department.\u00a0 As part of the agreement, the companies must pay $75 million and retain an Independent Monitor to monitor and assess their compliance with export laws for the next two years.\n\nThe Export Scheme\n\nSince 1989, the United States has imposed a prohibition upon the export to China of all U.S. defense articles and associated technical data as a result of the conduct in June 1989 at Tiananmen Square by the military of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u00a0 In February 1990, the U.S. Congress imposed a prohibition upon licenses or approvals for the export of defense articles to the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u00a0 In codifying the embargo, Congress specifically named helicopters for inclusion in the ban.\n\nDating back to the 1980s, China sought to develop a military attack helicopter.\u00a0 Beginning in the 1990s, after Congress had imposed the prohibition on exports to China, China sought to develop its attack helicopter under the guise of a civilian medium helicopter program in order to secure Western assistance.\u00a0 The Z-10, developed with assistance from Western suppliers, is China\u2019s first modern military attack helicopter.\n\nDuring the development phases of China\u2019s Z-10 program, each Z-10 helicopter was powered by engines supplied by PWC.\u00a0 PWC delivered 10 of these development engines to China in 2001 and 2002.\u00a0 Despite the military nature of the Z-10 helicopter, PWC determined on its own that these development engines for the Z-10 did not constitute \u201cdefense articles,\u201d requiring a U.S. export license, because they were identical to those engines PWC was already supplying China for a commercial helicopter.\n\nBecause the Electronic Engine Control software, made by HSC in the United States to test and operate the PWC engines, was modified for a military helicopter application, it was a defense article and required a U.S. export license.\u00a0 Still, PWC knowingly and willfully caused this software to be exported to China for the Z-10 without any U.S. export license.\u00a0 In 2002 and 2003, PWC caused six versions of the military software to be illegally exported from HSC in the United States to PWC in Canada, and then to China, where it was used in the PWC engines for the Z-10.\n\nAccording to court documents, PWC knew from the start of the Z-10 project in 2000 that the Chinese were developing an attack helicopter and that supplying it with U.S.-origin components would be illegal.\u00a0 When the Chinese claimed that a civil version of the helicopter would be developed in parallel, PWC marketing personnel expressed skepticism internally about the \u201csudden appearance\u201d of the civil program, the timing of which they questioned as \u201creal or imagined.\u201d\u00a0 PWC nevertheless saw an opening for PWC \u201cto insist on exclusivity in [the] civil version of this helicopter,\u201d and stated that the Chinese would \u201cno longer make reference to the military program.\u201d PWC failed to notify UTC or HSC about the attack helicopter until years later and purposely turned a blind eye to the helicopter\u2019s military application.\n\nHSC in the United States had believed it was providing its software to PWC for a civilian helicopter in China, based on claims from PWC.\u00a0 By early 2004, HSC learned there might an export problem and stopped working on the Z-10 project.\u00a0 UTC also began to ask PWC about the exports to China for the Z-10.\u00a0 Regardless, PWC on its own modified the software and continued to export it to China through June 2005.\n\nAccording to court documents, PWC\u2019s illegal conduct was driven by profit.\u00a0 PWC anticipated that its work on the Z-10 military attack helicopter in China would open the door to a far more lucrative civilian helicopter market in China, which according to PWC estimates, was potentially worth as much as $2 billion to PWC.\n\nBelated and False Disclosures to U.S. Government\n\nThese companies failed to disclose to the U.S. government the illegal exports to China for several years and only did so after an investor group queried UTC in early 2006 about whether PWC\u2019s role in China\u2019s Z-10 attack helicopter might violate U.S. laws.\u00a0 The companies then made an initial disclosure to the State Department in July 2006, with follow-up submissions in August and September 2006.\n\nThe 2006 disclosures contained numerous false statements.\u00a0 Among other things, the companies falsely asserted that they were unaware until 2003 or 2004 that the Z-10 program involved a military helicopter.\u00a0 In fact, by the time of the disclosures, all three companies were aware that PWC officials knew at the project\u2019s inception in 2000 that the Z-10 program involved an attack helicopter.\n\nToday, the Z-10 helicopter is in production and initial batches were delivered to the People\u2019s Liberation Army of China in 2009 and 2010.\u00a0 The primary mission of the Z-10 is anti-armor and battlefield interdiction.\u00a0 Weapons of the Z-10 have included 30 mm cannons, anti-tank guided missiles, air-to-air missiles and unguided rockets.\u201cPWC exported controlled U.S. technology to China, knowing it would be used in the development of a military attack helicopter in violation of the U.S. arms embargo with China,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Fein.\u00a0 \u201cPWC took what it described internally as a \u2018calculated risk,\u2019 because it wanted to become the exclusive supplier for a civil helicopter market in China with projected revenues of up to two billion dollars.\u00a0 Several years after the violations were known, UTC, HSC and PWC disclosed the violations to the government and made false statements in doing so.\u00a0 The guilty pleas by PWC and the agreement reached with all three companies should send a clear message that any corporation that willfully sends export controlled material to an embargoed nation will be prosecuted and punished, as will those who know about it and fail to make a timely and truthful disclosure.\u201d\n\n\u201cDue in part to the efforts of these companies, China was able to develop its first modern military attack helicopter with restricted U.S. defense technology.\u00a0 As today\u2019s case demonstrates, the Justice Department will spare no effort to hold accountable those who compromise U.S. national security for the sake of profits and then lie about it to the government,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Monaco.\u00a0 \u201cI thank the agents, analysts and prosecutors who helped bring about this important case.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis case is a clear example of how the illegal export of sensitive technology reduces the advantages our military currently possesses,\u201d said ICE Director Morton.\u00a0 \u201cI am hopeful that the conviction of Pratt & Whitney Canada and the substantial penalty levied against United Technologies and its subsidiaries will deter other companies from considering similarly ill-conceived business practices in the future.\u00a0 American military prowess depends on lawful, controlled exports of sensitive technology by U.S. industries and their subsidiaries, which is why ICE will continue its present campaign to aggressively investigate and prosecute criminal violations of U.S. export laws relating to national security.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s charges and settlement demonstrate the continued commitment of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) and fellow agencies to protect sensitive U.S. defense technology from being illegally exported,\u201d said DCIS Special Agent in Charge Bradley.\u00a0 \u201cSafeguarding our military technology is vital to our nation\u2019s defense and the protection of our war fighters both home and abroad.\u00a0 We know that foreign governments are actively seeking U.S. defense technology for their own development.\u00a0 Thwarting these efforts is a top priority for DCIS.\u00a0 I applaud the agents and prosecutors who worked tirelessly to bring about this result.\u201d\n\n\u201cPreventing the loss of critical U.S. information and technologies is one of the most important investigative priorities of the FBI,\u201d said FBI Special Agent in Charge Mertz.\u00a0 \u201cOur adversaries routinely target sensitive research and development data and intellectual property from universities, government agencies, manufacturers, and defense contractors.\u00a0 While the thefts associated with economic espionage and illegal technology transfers may not capture the same level of attention as a terrorist incident, the costs to the U.S. economy and our national security are substantial.\u00a0 Violations of the Arms Export Control Act put our nation at risk and the FBI, along with all of our federal agency partners, are committed to ensuring that embargoed technologies do not fall into the wrong hands.\u00a0 Those who violate these laws should expect to be held accountable.\u00a0 An important part of the FBI\u2019s strategy in this area involves the development of strategic partnerships.\u00a0 In that regard, the FBI looks forward to future coordination with UTC and its subsidiaries to strengthen information sharing and counterintelligence awareness.\u201d\n\n\u201cProtecting national security is our top priority,\u201d said Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Enforcement Mills.\u00a0 \u201cToday\u2019s action sends a clear signal that federal law enforcement agencies will work together diligently to prevent U.S. technology from falling into the wrong hands.\u201d\n\nAssistant Secretary Shapiro, of the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Political and Military Affairs, said, \u201cToday\u2019s $75 million settlement with United Technologies Corporation sends a clear message:\u00a0 willful violators of U.S. arms export control regulations will be pursued and punished.\u00a0 The successful resolution of this case is the byproduct of the tireless work of our compliance officers and highlights the relentless commitment of the State Department to protect sensitive American technologies from being illegally transferred.\u201d\n\nU.S. Attorney Fein commended the many agencies involved in this investigation, including ICE\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in New Haven; the DCIS in New Haven; the New Haven Division of the FBI; the Department of Commerce\u2019s Boston Office of Export Enforcement.\u00a0 He also praised the Office of the HSI Attach\u00e9 in Toronto, which was essential to the initiation and investigation of this matter, and the State Department\u2019s Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance in the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, for its critical role in the global resolution of this matter.\n\nThe prosecution is being handled by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Stephen B. Reynolds and Michael J. Gustafson from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Connecticut, with assistance from Steven Pelak and Ryan Fayhee of the Counterespionage Section of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division.",

            "article_text": "A federal grand jury in San Diego, California, returned an indictment in May charging four nationals and residents of the People\u2019s Republic of China with a campaign to hack into the computer systems of dozens of victim companies, universities and government entities in the United States and abroad between 2011 and 2018. The indictment, which was unsealed on Friday, alleges that much of the conspiracy\u2019s theft was focused on information that was of significant economic benefit to China\u2019s companies and commercial sectors, including information that would allow the circumvention of lengthy and resource-intensive research and development processes. The defendants and their\u00a0Hainan State Security Department (HSSD)\u00a0conspirators sought to obfuscate the Chinese government\u2019s role in such theft by establishing a front company, Hainan Xiandun Technology Development Co., Ltd. (\u6d77\u5357\u4ed9\u76fe) (Hainan Xiandun), since disbanded, to operate out of Haikou, Hainan Province.\n\nThe two-count indictment alleges that Ding Xiaoyang (\u4e01\u6653\u9633), Cheng Qingmin (\u7a0b\u5e86\u6c11) and Zhu Yunmin (\u6731\u5141\u654f), were HSSD officers responsible for coordinating, facilitating and managing computer hackers and linguists at Hainan Xiandun and other MSS front companies to conduct hacking for the benefit of China and its state-owned and sponsored instrumentalities. The indictment alleges that Wu Shurong (\u5434\u6dd1\u8363) was a computer hacker who, as part of his job duties at Hainan Xiandun, created malware, hacked into computer systems operated by foreign governments, companies and universities, and supervised other Hainan Xiandun hackers.\n\nThe conspiracy\u2019s hacking campaign targeted victims in the United States, Austria, Cambodia, Canada, Germany, Indonesia, Malaysia, Norway, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Targeted industries included, among others, aviation, defense, education, government, health care, biopharmaceutical and maritime. Stolen trade secrets and confidential business information included, among other things, sensitive technologies used for submersibles and autonomous vehicles, specialty chemical formulas, commercial aircraft servicing, proprietary genetic-sequencing technology and data, and foreign information to support China\u2019s efforts to secure contracts for state-owned enterprises within the targeted country (e.g., large-scale high-speed railway development projects). At research institutes and universities, the conspiracy targeted infectious-disease research related to Ebola, MERS, HIV/AIDS, Marburg and tularemia.\n\nAs alleged, the charged MSS officers coordinated with staff and professors at various universities in Hainan and elsewhere in China to further the conspiracy\u2019s goals. Not only did such universities assist the MSS in identifying and recruiting hackers and linguists to penetrate and steal from the computer networks of targeted entities, including peers at many foreign universities, but personnel at one identified Hainan-based university also helped support and manage Hainan Xiandun as a front company, including through payroll, benefits and a mailing address.\n\n\u201cThese criminal charges once again highlight that China continues to use cyber-enabled attacks to steal what other countries make, in flagrant disregard of its bilateral and multilateral commitments,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco.\u00a0\u201cThe breadth and duration of China\u2019s hacking campaigns, including these efforts targeting a dozen countries across sectors ranging from healthcare and biomedical research to aviation and defense, remind us that no country or industry is safe. Today\u2019s international condemnation shows that the world wants fair rules, where countries invest in innovation, not theft.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe FBI, alongside our federal and international partners, remains committed to imposing risk and consequences on these malicious cyber actors here in the U.S. and abroad,\u201d\u00a0said Deputy Director Paul M. Abbate of the FBI. \u201cWe will not allow the Chinese government to continue to use these tactics to obtain unfair economic advantage for its companies and commercial sectors through criminal intrusion and theft. With these types of actions, the Chinese\u00a0government continues to undercut its own claims of being a trusted and effective partner in the international community.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis indictment alleges a worldwide hacking and economic espionage campaign led by the government of China,\u201d said Acting U.S. Attorney Randy Grossman for the Southern District of California. \u201cThe defendants include foreign intelligence officials who orchestrated the alleged offenses, and the indictment demonstrates how China\u2019s government made a deliberate choice to cheat and steal instead of innovate. These offenses threaten our economy and national security, and this prosecution reflects the Department of Justice\u2019s commitment and ability to hold individuals and nations accountable for stealing the ideas and intellectual achievements of our nation\u2019s best and brightest people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe FBI\u2019s San Diego Field Office is committed to protecting the people of the United States and the community of San Diego, to include our universities, health care systems, research institutes, and defense contractors,\u201d said Special Agent\u00a0in Charge Suzanne Turner of the FBI\u2019s San Diego Field Office. \u201cThe charges outlined today demonstrate China\u2019s continued, persistent computer intrusion efforts, which will not be tolerated here or abroad. We stand steadfast with our law enforcement partners in the United States and around the\u00a0world and will continue to hold accountable those who commit economic espionage and theft of intellectual property.\u201d\n\nThe defendants\u2019 activity had been previously identified by private sector security researchers, who have referred to the group as Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) 40, BRONZE, MOHAWK, FEVERDREAM, G0065, Gadolinium, GreenCrash, Hellsing, Kryptonite Panda, Leviathan, Mudcarp, Periscope, Temp.Periscope and Temp.Jumper.\n\nAccording to the indictment, to gain initial access to victim networks, the conspiracy sent fraudulent spearphishing emails, that were buttressed by fictitious online profiles and contained links to\u00a0doppelg\u00e4nger domain names, which were created to mimic or resemble the domains of legitimate companies. In some instances, the conspiracy used hijacked credentials, and the access they provided, to launch spearphishing campaigns against other users within the same victim entity or at other targeted entities. The conspiracy also used multiple and evolving sets of sophisticated malware, including both publicly available and customized malware, to obtain, expand and maintain unauthorized access to victim computers and networks. The conspiracy\u2019s malware included those identified by security researchers as BADFLICK, aka GreenCrash; PHOTO, aka Derusbi; MURKYTOP, aka mt.exe; and HOMEFRY, aka dp.dll. Such malware allowed for initial and continued intrusions into victim systems, lateral movement within a system, and theft of credentials, including administrator passwords.\n\nThe conspiracy often used anonymizer services, such as The Onion Router (TOR), to access malware on victim networks and manage their hacking infrastructure, including servers, domains and email accounts. The conspiracy further attempted to obscure its hacking activities through other third-party services. For example, the conspiracy used GitHub to both store malware and stolen data, which was concealed using steganography. The conspiracy also used Dropbox Application Programming Interface (API) keys in commands to upload stolen data directly to conspiracy-controlled Dropbox accounts to make it appear to network defenders that such data exfiltration was an employee\u2019s legitimate use of the Dropbox service.\n\nCoinciding with today\u2019s announcement, to enhance private sector network defense efforts against the conspirators, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released aJoint Cybersecurity Advisorycontaining these and further technical details, indicators of compromise and mitigation measures.\n\nThe defendants are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and one count of conspiracy to commit economic espionage, which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison. The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencings of the defendants will be determined by the assigned judge.\n\nThe investigation was conducted jointly by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of California, the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Controls Section, and the FBI\u2019s San Diego Field Office. The FBI\u2019s Cyber Division, Cyber Assistant Legal Attach\u00e9s and Legal Attach\u00e9s in countries around the world provided essential support. Numerous victims cooperated and provided valuable assistance in the investigation.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorneys Fred Sheppard and Sabrina Feve of the Southern District of California and Trial Attorney Matthew McKenzie of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting this case.\n\nThe details contained in the charging document are allegations. The defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.",

Unbeknownst to his employer, Harvard University, Lieber allegedly became a \u201cStrategic Scientist\u201d at WUT and, later, a contractual participant in China\u2019s Thousand Talents Plan from at least 2012 through 2015. \u00a0China\u2019s Thousand Talents Plan is one of the most prominent Chinese talent recruitment plans designed to attract, recruit and cultivate high-level scientific talent in furtherance of China\u2019s scientific development, economic prosperity and national security.\n\nUnder the terms of Lieber\u2019s three-year Thousand Talents contract, WUT allegedly paid Lieber a salary of up to $50,000 per month, living expenses of up to $150,000 and awarded him more than $1.5 million to establish a research lab at WUT. \u00a0It is alleged that in 2018 and 2019, Lieber lied to federal authorities about his involvement in the Thousand Talents Plan and his affiliation with WUT.\n\nAccording to the superseding indictment, in tax years 2013 and 2014, Lieber earned income from WUT in the form of salary and other payments made to him pursuant to the Strategic Scientist and Thousand Talents Contracts, which he did not disclose to the IRS on his federal income tax returns. \u00a0The superseding indictment also alleges that Lieber, together with WUT officials, opened a bank account at a Chinese bank during a trip to Wuhan in 2012.\u00a0 \u00a0Thereafter, between at least 2013 and 2015, WUT periodically deposited portions of Lieber\u2019s salary into that account. U.S. taxpayers are required to report the existence of any foreign bank account that holds more than $10,000 at any time during a given year by the filing an FBAR with the IRS. \u00a0Lieber allegedly failed to file FBARs for the years 2014 and 2015.\n\nThe charge of making false statements provides for a sentence of up to five years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000. \u00a0The charge of making and subscribing false income tax returns provides for a sentence of up to three years in prison, one year of supervised release and a $100,000 fine. \u00a0The charge of failing to file an FBAR provides for a sentence of up to five years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000. \u00a0Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nAssistant Attorney General for National Security John C.

            "article_text": "A Chinese scientist was sentenced to 121 months in a federal prison for conspiring to steal samples of a variety of rice seeds from a Kansas biopharmaceutical research facility.\n\nActing Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division and U.S. Attorney Stephen R. McAllister of the District of Kansas made the announcement.\n\nWeiqiang Zhang, 51, a Chinese national, and U.S. legal permanent resident residing in Manhattan, Kansas, was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Carlos Murguia in the District of Kansas. Zhang was convicted on Feb. 15, 2017 of one count of conspiracy to steal trade secrets, one count of conspiracy to commit interstate transportation of stolen property and one count of interstate transportation of stolen property.\n\nEvidence at trial established that Zhang worked as a rice breeder for Ventria Bioscience in Junction City, Kansas. \u00a0Ventria develops genetically programmed rice to express recombinant human proteins, which are then extracted for use in the therapeutic and medical fields.\u00a0 Zhang has a master\u2019s degree in agriculture from Shengyang Agricultural University in China and a doctorate from Louisiana State University.\n\nAccording to trial evidence, Zhang acquired without authorization hundreds of rice seeds produced by Ventria and stored them at his residence in Manhattan. \u00a0The rice seeds have a wide variety of health research applications and were developed to produce either human serum albumin, contained in blood, or lactoferrin, an iron-binding protein found, for example, in human milk.\u00a0 Ventria spent millions of dollars and years of research developing its seeds and cost-effective methods to extract the proteins, which are used to develop lifesaving products for global markets. Ventria used locked doors with magnetic card readers to restrict access to the temperature-controlled environment where the seeds were stored and processed.\n\nTrial evidence demonstrated that in the summer of 2013, personnel from a crop research institute in China visited Zhang at his home in Manhattan.\u00a0 Zhang drove the visitors to tour facilities in Iowa, Missouri and Ohio. \u00a0On Aug. 7, 2013, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers found seeds belonging to Ventria in the luggage of Zhang\u2019s visitors as they prepared to leave the United States for China.\n\n\u201cWeiqiang Zhang betrayed his employer by unlawfully providing its proprietary rice seeds to representatives of a Chinese crop institute,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Cronan. \u201cToday\u2019s sentence demonstrates the significant consequences awaiting those who would steal trade secrets from American companies.\u00a0 The Criminal Division and its law enforcement partners will continue to work closely with companies like Ventria to protect American intellectual property\u2014which is essential to our economy and way of life\u2014against all threats both foreign and domestic.\u201d\n\n\u201cCross-border intellectual property theft not only hurts victim companies, it also threatens our national security,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Demers.\u00a0 \u201cFBI\u2019s vigilance stopped Ventria\u2019s intellectual property from leaving our country in the nick of time, but it was Ventria\u2019s cooperation that allowed us to hold Zhang accountable for his crimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cVentria invested years of research and tens of millions of dollars to create a new and beneficial product,\u201d said U.S. Attorney McAllister. \u201cIt is vital that we protect such intellectual property from theft and exploitation by foreign interests. We all benefit when American companies continue to drive socially valuable advancements in food, medicine and technology.\u201d\n\nThe FBI\u2019s Little Rock, Arkansas, Field Office and Kansas City, Missouri, Field Office, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Arkansas investigated the case. \u00a0Trial Attorney Matt Walczewski of the National Security Division, Trial Attorneys Brian Resler and Evan Williams of the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Scott Rask of the District of Kansas prosecuted the case.",

            "article_text": "NEWARK, N.J. \u2013 Two Iranian nationals have been charged in connection with a coordinated cyber intrusion campaign \u2013 sometimes at the behest of the government of Iran \u2013 targeting computers in New Jersey and around the world, U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito announced today.\n\nHooman Heidarian, a/k/a \u201cneo,\u201d 30, and Mehdi Farhadi, a/k/a \u201cMehdi Mahdavi\u201d and \u201cMohammad Mehdi Farhadi Ramin,\u201d 34, both of Hamedan, Iran, are each charged in a 10-count indictment returned Sept. 15, 2020, with: one count each of conspiracy to commit fraud and related activity in connection with computers and access devices; computer fraud - unauthorized access to protected computers: computer fraud, unauthorized damage to protected computers; conspiracy to commit wire fraud; and access device fraud; and five counts of aggravated identity theft.\n\n\u201cThese Iranian nationals allegedly conducted a wide-ranging campaign on computers here in New Jersey and around the world,\u201d U.S. Attorney Carpenito said. \u201cThey brazenly infiltrated computer systems and targeted intellectual property and often sought to intimidate perceived enemies of Iran, including dissidents fighting for human rights in Iran and around the world. This conduct threatens our national security, and as a result, these defendants are wanted by the FBI and are considered fugitives from justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will not bring the rule of law to cyberspace until governments refuse to provide safe harbor for criminal hacking within their borders,\u201d Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers said. \u201cUnfortunately, our cases demonstrate that at least four nations\u2014Iran, China, Russia and North Korea\u2014will allow criminal hackers to victimize individuals and companies from around the world, as long as these hackers will also work for that country\u2019s government\u2014gathering information on human rights activists, dissidents and others of intelligence interest.\u00a0 Today\u2019s defendants will now learn that such service to the Iranian regime is not an asset, but a criminal yoke that they will now carry until the day they are brought to justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe indictment of two Iranian nationals charged with computer hacking, fraud, and aggravated identity theft demonstrates how the FBI continues to work relentlessly with our law enforcement partners to identify cybercriminals\u00a0who seek to do harm to American citizens, businesses, and universities,\u00a0regardless of where those criminals may reside and hold them accountable,\u201d George M. Crouch Jr., Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Newark Division, said. \u201cMehdi Farhadi and Hooman Heidarian are now fugitives and have been added to the FBI website for charges in connection with a massive, coordinated cyber intrusion campaign. These actions demonstrate how imposing risks and consequences on our cyber adversaries will continue to be a top priority for the FBI.\u201d\n\nAccording to the indictment:\n\nBeginning in at least 2013, the defendants were responsible for a coordinated campaign of cyber intrusions into computer systems in New Jersey and around the world. The victims included several American and foreign universities, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, a defense contractor, an aerospace company, a foreign policy organization, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), non-profits, and foreign government and other entities identified as rivals or adversaries to Iran around the world.\n\nHeidarian and Farhadi conducted many of these intrusions on behalf of the Iranian government. The stolen data was typically highly protected and extremely sensitive, and included confidential communications pertaining to national security, foreign policy intelligence, non-military nuclear information, aerospace data, human rights activist information, victim financial information and personally identifiable information, and intellectual property, including unpublished scientific research. The defendants also often vandalized websites using the pseudonym \u201cSejeal\u201d and posted messages that appeared to signal the demise of Iran\u2019s internal opposition, foreign adversaries, and countries identified as rivals to Iran, including Israel and Saudi Arabia.\n\nTactics and Techniques\n\nThe defendants conducted online reconnaissance to carefully select their victims, gathering data and intelligence to determine their areas of expertise, and assessing computer networks in preparation for launching cyber-attacks. They often used information obtained at this stage in latter phases of their hacking activities to complete a picture of processes, organizational structure, and potential soft spots of victim networks. The defendants used vulnerability-scanning tools to test the victim networks and to reveal security holes.\n\nThe defendants gained and maintained unauthorized access to victim networks using various tools, including: session hijacking, where a valid computer session was exploited to gain unauthorized access to information or services in a computer system; SQL injection, in which they used malicious code to access information that was not intended to be displayed, such as sensitive government data, user details, and personal identifiers; and malicious programs installations, which allowed the defendants to maintain unauthorized access to computers.\n\nThe defendants then used key-loggers and \u201cremote access Trojans\u201d to maintain access and monitor the actions of users of the victim networks. They also developed a botnet tool, which facilitated the spread of malware, denial of service attacks, and spamming to victim networks. In some instances, the defendants used their unauthorized access to victim networks or accounts to establish automated forwarding rules for compromised victim accounts, whereby new outgoing and incoming emails were automatically forwarded from the compromised accounts to accounts controlled by defendants\n\nUsing these methods, the defendants stole hundreds of terabytes of data, including confidential victim work product and intellectual property, and personal identifying information, such as access credentials, names, addresses, phone numbers, Social Security numbers, and birthdates. The defendants marketed stolen data on the black market.\n\nIn addition to stealing intellectual property and other data, the defendants, using the pseudonym \u201cSejeal,\u201d replaced the publicly available contents of websites with political and other ideological content, thereby defacing websites, for the apparent purpose of projecting Iranian influence and threatening perceived enemies of Iran. The defacements featured, among other things, images of burning Israeli flags and threats forecasting the death or demise of citizens in the United States, Israel, and elsewhere.\n\nU.S. Attorney Carpenito credited special agents of the FBI, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Crouch in Newark, with the investigation leading to the charges.\n\nThe counts of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and related activity in connection with computers and access devices, unauthorized access to protected computers, and computer fraud \u2013 unauthorized damage to protected computers, each carry a maximum sentence of five years in prison. The count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. The counts of aggravated identity theft each carry a mandatory sentence of two years in prison. The count of access device fraud carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.\n\nThe government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney Dean C. Sovolos of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office National Security Unit, Daniel V. Shapiro, Deputy Chief of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office Criminal Division, and Trial Attorney Scott McCulloch of the National Security Division.\n\nThe charges and allegations contained in the indictment are merely accusations and the defendants are considered innocent unless and until proven guilty.",

            "article_text": "BOSTON \u2013 The former Chair of Harvard University\u2019s Chemistry and Chemical Biology Department was sentenced today in federal court in Boston for lying to federal authorities about his affiliation with People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s Thousand Talents Program and the Wuhan University of Technology (WUT) in Wuhan, China, as well as failing to report income he received from WUT.Dr. Charles Lieber, 64, was sentenced by U.S. Senior District Court Judge Rya W. Zobel to time served (two days) in prison; two years of supervised release with six months of home confinement; a fine of $50,000; and $33,600 in restitution to the IRS. The government recommended a sentence of 90 days in prison and a $150,000 fine.\n\nIn December 2021, Lieber was convicted by a federal jury of two counts of making false statements to federal authorities, two counts of making and subscribing a false income tax return, and two counts of failing to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts (FBAR) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nLieber served as the Principal Investigator of the Lieber Research Group at Harvard University, which between 2008 and 2019 conducted more than $15 million in research sponsored by various U.S. Government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Defense (\u201cDOD\u201d) and the National Institutes of Health (\u201cNIH\u201d). Unbeknownst to his employer, Harvard University, Lieber became a \u201cStrategic Scientist\u201d at WUT and, later, a contractual participant in China\u2019s Thousand Talents Plan from at least 2012 through 2015. China\u2019s Thousand Talents Plan was one of the most prominent Chinese talent recruitment plans designed to attract, recruit and cultivate high-level scientific talent in furtherance of China\u2019s scientific development, economic prosperity and national security.In April 2018, during an interview with federal agents from DOD (one of the agencies that sponsored a portion of Lieber\u2019s research), among other things, Lieber falsely stated that he had never been asked to participate in the Thousand Talents Plan. Later, in January 2019, Lieber caused Harvard to falsely tell the NIH (another sponsor of Lieber\u2019s research) that Lieber was not, and had never been, a participant in the Thousand Talents Plan. Lieber knew these statements were false because he had signed a Thousand Talents contract with WUT in 2012, performed many of the duties and responsibilities required of him under that contract, and been paid a substantial salary by WUT in exchange for his work. Specifically, the terms of Lieber\u2019s three-year Thousand Talents contract with WUT entitled Lieber to a salary of up to $50,000 per month, living expenses of up to $150,000 and approximately n $1.5 million to conduct joint research at WUT.In tax years 2013 and 2014, Lieber earned income from WUT in the form of salary and other payments made to him pursuant to his Thousand Talents contract, which he did not disclose to the IRS on his federal income tax returns. Together with WUT officials, Lieber also opened a bank account at a Chinese bank during a trip to Wuhan in 2012. Thereafter, between at least 2012 and 2015, WUT periodically deposited portions of Lieber\u2019s salary into that account. U.S. taxpayers are required to report the existence of any foreign bank account that holds more than $10,000 at any time during a given year by the filing an FBAR with the IRS. According to Lieber, the balance of his Chinese bank account was approximately $200,000 in 2014 and 2015. \u00a0Nonetheless, Lieber purposely failed to file FBARs for those years.\n\nUnited States Attorney Rachael S. Rollins; Matthew Olsen, Assistant Attorney General for National Security; Joseph R. Bonavolonta, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Boston Division; Patrick J. Hegarty, Special Agent in Charge of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, Northeast Field Office; Joleen D.

            "article_text": "CLARKSBURG \u2013 Dr. James Patrick Lewis, of Fairview, West Virginia, was sentenced today to three months incarceration for a fraud charge involving West Virginia University, the Department of Justice announced.\n\nLewis was also fined $9,363 for the cost of the incarceration and ordered to pay $20,189 in restitution to WVU, which is paid in full.\n\nLewis, age 54, pleaded guilty to a one-count information charging him with \"Federal Program Fraud.\" From 2006 to August 2019, Lewis was a tenured professor at West Virginia University in the physics department, specializing in molecular reactions used in coal conversion technologies. In July 2017, Lewis entered into a contract of employment with the People\u2019s Republic of China through its \"Global Experts 1000 Talents Plan.\" China\u2019s Thousand Talents Plan is one of the most prominent Chinese Talent recruit plans that are designed to attract, recruit, and cultivate high-level scientific talent in furtherance of China\u2019s scientific development, economic prosperity and national security. These talent programs seek to lure overseas talent and foreign experts to bring their knowledge and experience to China and reward individuals for stealing proprietary information.\n\nAccording to Lewis\u2019s contract, the Chinese Academy of Sciences agreed to employ Lewis as a professor for at least three years. In return, Lewis agreed to maintain an active research program that yielded publications in high quality, peer-reviewed journals, and to provide research training and experience for Chinese Academy of Sciences students.\n\nAs a part of the program, Lewis was promised benefits, including a living subsidy of 1 million Yuan (approximately $143,000), a research subsidy of 4 million Yuan (approximately $573,000), and a salary of 600,000 Yuan (approximately $86,000). To receive the benefits, Lewis would have to work full time in China for three consecutive years, for no less than nine months per year, and would have to begin work no later than Aug. 8, 2018.\n\nIn March 2018, Lewis submitted a request to WVU for an alternate/parental work assignment, requesting to be released from his teaching duties for the fall 2018 semester in order to serve as the primary caregiver for a child he and his wife were expecting in June 2018. In fact, however, Lewis knew this request was fraudulent. Rather than caring for his newborn child, Lewis planned to work in China during the fall 2018 semester as a part of his agreement with the \"1000 Talents Plan.\" Based on the false justification Lewis offered, WVU granted his request.\n\nIn the fall of 2018, Lewis spent all but three weeks of the semester in China while his newborn child remained in the United States. During this period, Lewis received his full salary from WVU pursuant to his alternate/parental work assignment. Lewis\u2019s scheme allowed him to fraudulently obtain $20,189 from WVU.\n\nLewis is no longer employed by WVU, having resigned in August 2019. He was ordered to self-report to prison in 30 days.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney\u3000Jarod J. Douglas and Trial Attorney Evan N. Turgeon with the Department of Justice\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section, National Security Division, prosecuted\u3000the case on behalf of the government. The FBI and the Internal Revenue Service investigated. WVU cooperated in the investigation of this case.\n\nU.S. District Judge Thomas S. Kleeh presided.",

            "article_text": "PITTSBURGH - Scott W. Brady, United States Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, today named the Office\u2019s new executive leadership team and announced a restructuring of the Office\u2019s Criminal Division that will allow the office to best effectuate the Administration\u2019s priorities.\n\n\"This is an outstanding leadership team,\" stated United States Attorney Brady. \"These men and women are the finest our District has to offer \u2013 incredibly accomplished attorneys, highly respected among their peers and by the bench, and possessing the highest standards of character and integrity. They will serve the people of western Pennsylvania with great honor and distinction.\"\n\nMr. Brady named Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen R. Kaufman as his First Assistant U.S. Attorney. Mr. Kaufman has served as the Chief of the Criminal Division since 2010. In his 25 years as a federal prosecutor, Mr. Kaufman has handled a wide variety of violent crime, narcotics, child exploitation and white collar cases. Notable cases include the successful eight-week trial of the Pittsburgh La Cosa Nostra organized crime family on RICO charges, the prosecution of the distributors of China White, a deadly synthetic form of heroin which caused the overdose deaths of 17 individuals in 1988, the prosecution of Michael Carlow, owner of Pittsburgh Brewing and Clark Candy, for perpetuating a $31 million dollar check kiting scheme against PNC Bank, and more recently obtaining the conviction of and an 11-year prison sentence for Dr. Oliver Herndon, a physician who was the most prolific illegal distributor of oxycodone in the Pittsburgh area prior to his arrest. Mr. Kaufman is a graduate of Allegheny College and Harvard Law School.\n\nMr. Brady named former Assistant U.S. Attorney Tina O. Miller as Chief of the Criminal Division. She returns to the office today from Farrell & Reisinger, LLC, where she was a trial lawyer whose practice focused on criminal defense, corporate internal investigations, mediation and representing victims of crime in both criminal and civil cases. Ms. Miller has jury trial experience as both a federal prosecutor and defense counsel in a wide variety of cases, including fraud, arson, public corruption, arms trafficking, carjacking, narcotics trafficking and sex offenses. In her prior stint as a federal prosecutor, Ms. Miller successfully prosecuted Jelani Solomon, a major drug trafficker who also ordered the murder of a family member of someone he suspected of cooperating, and Scott Tyree, a Virginia man who met a 13-year-old Pittsburgh girl on the internet, drove her to his home in Virginia, and held her captive for three days until the FBI rescued her. Ms. Miller is a graduate of the University of Pittsburgh and Duquesne University School of Law.\n\nJennifer Andrade, an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Civil Division since January 2008, has been named Chief of the Civil Division. Prior to joining the office, Ms. Andrade served as a federal law clerk to the Hon. Ila Jeanne Sensenich for two years, and as a litigation associate in private practice for three years.

Ms. Andrade has served as an instructor at the National Advocacy Center in Columbia, South Carolina, and has also served in several leadership capacities for the Allegheny County Bar Association and Foundation, most recently as the Allegheny County Bar Foundation Vice President. Ms. Andrade is a graduate of Boston University and the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Rebecca Ross Haywood will continue to serve as Appellate Division Chief. Ms. Haywood has been an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Appellate Division since 2005. In this capacity, Ms. Haywood has successfully defended over 100 criminal and civil appeals, including a heath care fraud conviction of the owner and operator of a nursing home specializing in the care of Alzheimer\u2019s patients and the 45-year sentence of a medical student convicted of child pornography offenses. Ms. Haywood will remain responsible for coordinating and reviewing all of the appellate filings emanating from the Western District of Pennsylvania. She has previous service as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Civil Division dating from 1997. Ms. Haywood is currently Vice-Chair of the Third Circuit Lawyers Advisory Committee, which works with the Court of Appeals to improve the administration of justice. Ms. Haywood is a graduate of Princeton University and the University of Michigan Law School.\n\nBarbara Bacvinskas, a Department of Justice employee since 1983, will continue to serve as the Administrative Officer for the District.\n\nIn addition to naming his leadership team, Mr. Brady announced a reorganized Criminal Division. The Criminal Division will have four Sections: 1.) Cyber/National Security, 2.) Economic Crimes, 3.) Major Crimes, and 4.) Narcotics. The new Criminal Division sections will be overseen as follows: Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles A. \"Tod\" Eberle will supervise the Cyber/National Security Section; Nelson P.

            "article_text": "Chairman Lee, Ranking Member Klobuchar, and distinguished members of the Subcommittee, it is an honor for me to appear before you today on behalf of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice.\u00a0 I want to thank especially Chairman Lee and Ranking Member Klobuchar for your support of my efforts and those of the Department this past year.\u00a0 I am humbled by your support of my nomination, and am grateful for your public support of our work at the Antitrust Division to fairly and effectively enforce the antitrust laws.\u00a0 I appreciate the important role this Committee plays in our constitutional system of checks and balances.\u00a0 I view my position as the Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust as that of a protector of the rights of all American consumers to the fruits of vigorous competition.\u00a0 Free market competition is a bedrock principle of the American economy, and protecting, preserving and promoting competition through the enforcement of our antitrust laws is a vital function of our government. \u00a0I, and all employees of the Antitrust Division, are dedicated to carrying out that mission to the very best of our abilities.\n\nThe Antitrust Division has been extraordinarily busy in our daily efforts to protect consumers, workers, and entrepreneurs through sound and vigorous antitrust enforcement and competition advocacy throughout the government.\u00a0 My testimony today will review our extensive efforts in criminal and civil enforcement and many of our recent new initiatives to promote competition.\n\nThe following are some highlights of the Division\u2019s recent accomplishments and initiatives.\n\nCOMPETITION ADVOCACY AND OTHER NEW INITIATIVES:\n\nCIVIL HIGHLIGHTS:\n\nCRIMINAL HIGHLIGHTS:\n\nINTERNATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS:\n\nCriminal Enforcement\n\nThe Division investigated and prosecuted antitrust violations across many sectors of the economy, with over $3.243 billion in criminal fines imposed in FYs 2016-17.\u00a0 In the most recent fiscal year, the Division investigated and prosecuted individual cases that resulted in the highest number of individuals sentenced to prison terms since 2012.\u00a0 The Division also has made efforts to increase self-reporting of cartel behavior through its clarification of its amnesty program.\n\nCriminal enforcement has long been a vital tool to protect competition and consumers.\u00a0 The Sherman Act has been a criminal statute ever since it was signed into law in 1890.\u00a0 Antitrust violations such as price-fixing, bid-rigging, and market allocation unambiguously disrupt the integrity of the competitive process, harm consumers, and reduce faith in the free market system.\u00a0 Such harmful agreements among competitors are subject to a rule of per se illegality, and individuals who engage in such conduct appropriately face criminal accountability along with the corporations they serve.\u00a0 At the Division, we focus our criminal enforcement efforts on holding culpable corporations and individuals accountable, including high-level executives.\n\nIn an important example, the Division brought charges against and obtained guilty pleas from executives of a generic pharmaceutical company for price fixing, bid rigging, and customer allocation for an antibiotic and a drug used to treat diabetes.\u00a0 (E.g., Plea Agreement,U.S. v. Glazer, 2:16-cr-00506 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 9, 2017),/media/876731/dl?inline.)\u00a0 It is particularly galling that, when healthcare prices in the United States are already high, certain corporations and executives engaged in anticompetitive activities at the expense of individuals who depend on critical medications.\n\nIn another area that has a profound impact on American consumers, the Division actively prosecuted bid rigging and fraud relating to real estate foreclosure auctions.\u00a0 To date, 138 individuals and 3 companies have been charged as a result of the Division\u2019s investigations of bid rigging and fraud relating to real estate foreclosure auctions in California, Alabama, North Carolina, Georgia, and Mississippi.\u00a0 (E.g., Press Release, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, Seventh Mississippi Real Estate Investor Pleads Guilty to Conspiring to Rig Bids At Public Foreclosure Auctions (July 19, 2018),https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seventh-mississippi-real-estate-investor-pleads-guilty-conspiring-rig-bids-public-foreclosure.)\u00a0 On an individual basis, each of these cases is relatively small, but on an aggregate basis, these cases are important to the economy, particularly because the convicted investors subverted competition and lined their pockets by illegal bid rigging and fraud while diverting money from the homeowners and mortgage holders entitled to any proceeds.\n\nThe Division has many open criminal investigations.\u00a0 The Division is trying more criminal cases than ever before and obtaining more prison sentences for individuals than in recent years.\u00a0 Corporate leaders and business executives who consider deviating from the rules of our free enterprise system should take notice.\n\nMoreover, the American public should know that the Antitrust Division is looking out for their salaries, as well.\u00a0 We have put employers on notice that agreements between employers that eliminate competition for hiring employees in the form of no-hire or non-solicitation agreements (often referred to as \u201cno-poach\u201d agreements) are per se violations of the Sherman Act when they are not ancillary to legitimate collaborations.\u00a0 In October 2016, the Division reminded the business community that no-poach and wage-fixing agreements can be prosecuted as criminal violations when they are not reasonably necessary to a separate, legitimate transaction or collaboration between employers.\u00a0 As a matter of prosecutorial discretion, the Division will pursue no-poach agreements terminated before October 2016 through civil actions.\u00a0 Defendants should anticipate potential criminal enforcement actions for any such naked no-poach agreements we uncover that post-date our October 2016 guidance, although we reserve discretion as appropriate in making our ultimate determinations.\n\nThe Division will continue to be diligent in detecting and deterring collusion that harms American consumers, and we will remain focused on crucial industries that affect Americans deeply, such as real estate, food, financial services, and health care, just to name a few.\n\nCivil Enforcement\n\nOur merger review program is perhaps the best known of the Division\u2019s many functions, as key mergers generate not only extensive media interest but also typically touch the everyday lives of the American public.\u00a0 Protecting American consumers and businesses from anticompetitive mergers is an essential element of the Division\u2019s mission.\n\nThe Division has been confronting huge mergers that cover large swaths of the U.S. economy that touch nearly every consumer, including telecommunications and entertainment (AT&T/Time Warner), agriculture (Bayer/Monsanto, Dow/Dupont), and health care (CVS/Aetna), among many others.\u00a0 We invest large portions of our limited resources to evaluate these massive transactions to ensure that consumers remain protected and competition is preserved.\u00a0 As a result, we have been extraordinarily busy in our merger review program.\n\nOne prominent example of our efforts on behalf of the American consumer is our review and challenge of AT&T\u2019s $108 billion acquisition of Time Warner, one of the largest transactions in U.S. history.\u00a0 After the matter did not settle, we litigated in the district court for the District of Columbia the first vertical merger case that went to judgment in 40 years.\u00a0 We have appealed the district court\u2019s decision and are proceeding before the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on an expedited review schedule.\u00a0 (Proof Brief of Appellant United States of America,U.S. v. AT&T Inc., No. 18-5214 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 6, 2018),/media/973241/dl?inline.)\n\nAT&T/Time Warner is only one of the mega-mergers we have focused on in the past year.\u00a0 In May, in response to Bayer\u2019s proposed $66 billion acquisition of Monsanto, we secured a $9 billion divestiture to protect consumers.\u00a0 (Competitive Impact Statement,U.S. v. Bayer AG & Monsanto Co., No. 1:18- cv-01241 (D.D.C. May 29, 2018),/media/954026/dl?inline.)\u00a0 Bayer and Monsanto were two of the largest agricultural companies in the world, and they competed to provide farmers with a broad range of seed and crop protection products. \u00a0After a thorough investigation, we concluded that the proposed merger would have likely resulted in higher prices, lower quality, and fewer choices to farmers, and ultimately American consumers, across a wide array of seed and crop protection products.\u00a0 The merger also threatened to stifle the innovation in agricultural technologies that has produced significant benefits to American farmers and consumers.\n\nWe were able to negotiate appropriate solutions to those competitive problems, including divestitures to BASF, a global chemical company with a multi-billion-dollar crop protection business.\u00a0 Through these divestitures, we achieved a robust structural solution that preserves competition from horizontal and vertical concerns raised by the merger.\u00a0 The settlement also addressed incentives to compete through innovation by requiring divestitures of certain intellectual property and research capabilities.\u00a0 These innovation-focused divestitures include \u201cpipeline\u201d R&D projects and Bayer\u2019s nascent \u201cdigital agriculture\u201d business.\u00a0 The settlement also reflected important efforts to strengthen the enforceability and effectiveness of our consent decrees.\n\nIn another large agricultural matter, the Division obtained important divestitures associated with Dow\u2019s acquisition of DuPont.\u00a0 (Competitive Impact Statement,U.S. & Plaintiff States v. Dow Chemical Co. & E.I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co., No. 1:17-cv-01176 (D.D.C. June 15, 2017),/media/900176/dl?inline.)\u00a0 The Division\u2019s structural remedies were focused on preserving viable, ongoing businesses that preserve needed competition in the agricultural sector.\n\nFor the foreseeable future, the Division\u2019s merger enforcement activities will continue ahead at full steam.\u00a0 We continue to vigorously enforce the laws and review pending transactions in order to preserve robust competition for the millions of Americans who rely on private health insurance products.\n\nI would note that these efforts, especially when we pursue litigation against very large mergers, which often involve threats to competition in multiple markets, are resource intensive.\u00a0 Not only do they require substantial devotion of personnel, but they also require increasingly large outlays for experts and document review.\n\nThanks to the hard work and dedication of the Antitrust Division staff, we have often been able to resolve large and significant transactions within six months, as illustrated in the recent Disney/Fox and Cigna/Express Scripts investigations.\u00a0 Nonetheless, doing all we can to modernize and speed up the process of merger review is a worthy goal.\u00a0 To that end, I recently announced a series of changes in how we approach the merger review process at the Division.\u00a0 As part of this improved process, we will post a model voluntary request letter and a model timing agreement on our website.\u00a0 Going forward, we will also make some changes to what we generally agree to in timing agreements.\u00a0 We will generally seek to collect documents from fewer custodians and to take fewer depositions. \u00a0Provided the parties agree to faster and earlier productions, make certain commitments on privilege, and agree to longer post-complaint discovery (if necessary), we will shorten the time from the parties certifying compliance to the Division making a decision to 60 days or less, with the proviso that the responsible deputy can extend that time period if he or she deems it necessary.\u00a0 With respect to Civil Investigative Demand enforcement, we will bring enforcement actions if necessary to ensure timely and complete compliance.\u00a0 We are also withdrawing the 2011 Policy Guide to Merger Remedies.\u00a0 The 2004 Policy Guide to Merger Remedies will be in effect until we release an updated policy.\u00a0 (Makan Delrahim, Assistant Att\u2019y Gen., Antitrust Div., U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, It Takes Two: Modernizing the Merger Review Process, Remarks as Prepared for the 2018 Global Antitrust Enforcement Symposium (Sept. 25, 2018),/media/977416/dl?inline.)\n\nIn addition to our merger review program, the Division also expends substantial resources investigating and, when appropriate, challenging non-merger conduct that may have the unlawful effect of depriving consumers of the fruits of robust competition. \u00a0Some of these conduct issues are straightforward applications of antitrust principles.\u00a0 For example, the Division has successfully challenged unlawful agreements among South Central Michigan hospitals to not market their services to customers in each other\u2019s territories.\u00a0 In February, following almost three years of litigation, the Division entered into a resolution of its litigation with the last of these hospitals: Henry Ford Allegiance Health (\u201cAllegiance\u201d), which operates a 475-bed hospital in Jackson County, Michigan.\u00a0 (Competitive Impact Statement,U.S. & Mich. v. W.A. Foote Mem\u2019l Hosp. D/B/A Allegiance Health, No. 5:15-cv-12311(E.D. Mich. Feb. 27, 2018),/media/941606/dl?inline.)\n\nSome conduct issues are complex and require close study for when and how they affect competition and how they should be analyzed under the antitrust laws.\u00a0 For example, I have given speeches focusing on how policies adopted by a standards setting organization (SSO) should ensure that a diversity of views are represented, that patent holders have adequate incentives to innovate and create new technologies, and that licensees have appropriate incentives to implement those technologies.\u00a0 (E.g., Makan Delrahim, Assistant Att\u2019y Gen., Antitrust Div., U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, The \u201cNew Madison\u201d Approach to Antitrust and Intellectual Property Law (Mar. 16, 2018),https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/assistant-attorney-general-makan-delrahim-delivers-keynote-address-university.)\u00a0 Because SSOs can promote innovation but also provide opportunities for competitors to harm competition, it is critical to examine closely the proper role of antitrust law and take enforcement or advocacy efforts that appropriately maximize incentives for innovation.\n\nAlong with our specific enforcement actions, the Division continues to pursue policy initiatives to strengthen our civil enforcement program.\u00a0 One such initiative is to streamline and improve the Division\u2019s use of consent decrees and other remedies, guided by the view that antitrust enforcement is law enforcement, not regulation.\u00a0 (SeeMakan Delrahim, Assistant Att\u2019y Gen., Antitrust Div., U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, Remarks at the Antitrust Division's Second Roundtable on Competition and Deregulation (Apr. 26, 2018),https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/assistant-attorney-general-makan-delrahim-delivers-remarks-antitrust-divisions-second.)\u00a0 The Division will favor structural relief such as divestitures that rely on free market competitive processes to remedy competitive concerns with a merger rather than behavioral relief that regulates conduct.\u00a0 Doing so places risks of failure on the merging parties and relies on ongoing mechanisms to enforce settlement terms.\n\nA crucial aspect of a consent decree is the ability to enforce it to ensure that the remedy that was necessary to preserve competition is fully implemented.\u00a0 In that regard, we have implemented a number of changes in the Division\u2019s practices to strengthen our ability to ensure decree compliance.\u00a0 First, we are now incorporating a set of provisions as standard improvements in our consent decrees that will make decrees more enforceable.\u00a0 Under these provisions, negotiated with the settling parties, the Division may establish a violation of a consent decree by a preponderance of the evidence (rather than the more exacting clear and convincing evidence standard), thereby using the same standard in a decree violation lawsuit that applies to proving liability in a civil antitrust case in the first instance.\n\nAnother of the new provisions permits the government to apply for an extension of a decree\u2019s term if the court finds a violation of the decree.\u00a0 An additional new term requires defendants to reimburse the taxpayers for attorneys\u2019 fees, expert fees, and costs incurred in connection with any consent decree enforcement effort.\u00a0 After a certain number of years, typically five, another new provision gives the Division the ability to terminate a decree upon notice to the court and defendants if it concludes in its discretion the decree is no longer necessary to protect competition.\u00a0 We are also establishing a new Office of Decree Enforcement in the Division to dedicate Division personnel to ensuring proactive enforcement of consent decrees.\n\nLast, but not least, we are in the midst of a robust effort to review nearly 1,300 so-called \u201clegacy\u201d judgments, some of which date back about a century.\u00a0 Our review considers changes in industry conditions, changes in economics, and changes in law to determine whether these decrees are necessary to protect competition and consumers. \u00a0Some of them may be affirmatively harmful to competition.\u00a0 We have begun the process of filing motions in federal district courts to terminate decrees that are no longer needed to protect competition.\u00a0 In August, the D.C. District Court granted our first motion to terminate 19 such judgments.\u00a0 (Order Terminating Final Judgments,U.S. v. American Amusement Ticket Manufacturers Association, 1:18-mc-00091-BAH (D.D.C Aug. 15, 2018),/media/1183021/dl?inline.) This ongoing effort will continue to identify and eliminate unnecessary restrictions on individuals and businesses who remain subject to legacy decrees so that we may better focus the Division\u2019s resources and attention on protecting competition.\n\nAs part of this effort, we also announced our review of the Paramount Consent Decrees, which for over seventy years have regulated how certain movie studios distribute films to movie theatres.\u00a0 The public is invited to comment on the Paramount Consent Decrees until the comment period closes tomorrow, October 4.\u00a0 (Press Release, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, Department of Justice Opens Review of Paramount Consent Decrees (Aug. 2, 2018),https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-opens-review-paramount-consent-decrees.)\n\nPolicy and Program Initiatives\n\nApart from our direct enforcement efforts, the Division has implemented a wide range of initiatives designed to advance competition both nationally and internationally.\u00a0 These efforts do not always draw the same interest as our enforcement cases, but can be just as essential, if not more so, to our efforts to protect American consumers and businesses.\u00a0 I will discuss briefly a few of them.\n\nInternational: Multilateral Framework on Procedures\n\nToday, companies must regularly navigate the antitrust and competition enforcement authorities that now exist across the globe.\u00a0 To promote competition and due process, the United States regularly reaches out to our international counterparts in efforts to harmonize practices around those that best promote competition and to help ensure that competition laws around the world are enforced efficiently, effectively, and fairly.\u00a0 In June, the United States, in partnership with leading antitrust agencies around the world, advanced an effort to better align with one another on a core set of procedural norms through the Multilateral Framework on Procedures in Competition Law Investigation and Enforcement (or \u201cMFP\u201d).\u00a0 (SeeMakan Delrahim, Assistant Att\u2019y Gen., Antitrust Div., U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, Remarks on Global Antitrust Enforcement at the Council on Foreign Relations (June 1, 2018),https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/assistant-attorney-general-makan-delrahim-delivers-remarks-global-antitrust-enforcement.)\u00a0 We are working closely with our international colleagues to achieve consensus on, and publicly commit to, fundamental procedural protections necessary to ensure due process such as non-discrimination, transparency, timely resolution, confidentiality, conflicts of interest, proper notice, opportunity to defend, access to counsel, and judicial review.\n\nGiven the complex array of antitrust issues we address with our sister competition agencies across the globe, we are also improving the way we tackle these issues internally.\u00a0 For example, we established formal internal working groups that incorporate staff from all sections in the Division.\u00a0 These working groups meet regularly, sometimes with input from outside speakers.\u00a0 The goal is to learn about new and ongoing international issues, share ideas, discuss best practices, forge consensus, and identify the people and resources that can help address these challenges.\n\nAppellate: Amicus Initiative\n\nThe Division has recently expanded our amicus program to increase our participation in private litigation not only in the Supreme Court, but at the district and appellate courts as well.\u00a0 In that way, we can more proactively and more effectively promote appropriate use of antitrust and competition principles across the judiciary.\u00a0 So far, in 2018, the Division has filed five statements of interest at the district court and five amicus briefs in an appeals court in cases where the United States is not a party, as compared to just two amicus briefs in 2017.\n\nThought Leadership\n\nThrough workshops and roundtables, the Division provides a forum for industry participants, academics, consumer advocates, and other interested parties to discuss important developments in particular business sectors, the appropriate scope of various legal doctrines, or recent advancements in our understanding of relevant economic principles.\n\nOn three dates this spring, the Division held a series of public roundtable discussions to explore the relationship between competition and regulation and its implications for antitrust enforcement.\u00a0 (Public Roundtable Discussion Series on Regulation & Antitrust Law, Antitrust Div., U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice,https://www.justice.gov/atr/CompReg(last updated June 25, 2018).)\u00a0 Specific issues included exemptions and immunities from the antitrust laws, the most effective and appropriate scope for consent decrees, and the consumer costs of anticompetitive regulations.\u00a0 Our speakers spanned a diverse range of policy perspectives and stakeholder viewpoints.\u00a0 These were fruitful discussions that are already shaping our actions at the Division, such as recent improvements to the Division\u2019s consent decree practices.\n\nMoreover, in April, the Division hosted a public Roundtable on Criminal Antitrust Compliance to engage with inside and outside corporate counsel, foreign antitrust enforcers, international organization representatives, and other interested stakeholders on the topic of criminal antitrust compliance.\u00a0 (Public Roundtable on Criminal Antitrust Compliance, Antitrust Div., U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice,https://www.justice.gov/atr/public-roundtable-antitrust-criminal-compliance(last updated Sept. 10, 2018).)\u00a0 More than 100 participants attended and discussed the role that antitrust compliance programs play in preventing and detecting criminal antitrust violations, and ways to further promote corporate antitrust compliance.\n\nIn June, the Division also held a joint workshop with the FTC on competition in residential real estate brokerage markets.\u00a0 (Public Workshop: What\u2019s New in Residential Real Estate Brokerage Competition, Antitrust Div., U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice,https://www.justice.gov/atr/events/public-workshop-competition-real-estate(last updated June 25, 2018).)\u00a0 The workshop drew a diverse array of industry participants, thought leaders, and stakeholders.\u00a0 This is a sector that has merited recent competition advocacy from the Division to state officials, and the diverse viewpoints from the workshop will inform the Division\u2019s advocacy and enforcement efforts going forward.\u00a0 We continue to closely monitor industry developments and the state of competition.\n\nIn addition to workshops and roundtables, the Division has also established the Jackson-Nash Addresses, a new lecture series to inspire and educate Division staff and the public about cutting-edge issues and developments in the field.\u00a0 (Press Release, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, Antitrust Division Establishes the \u201cJackson-Nash Address\u201d and Announces Professor Alvin Roth as Inaugural Speaker (Feb. 8, 2018),https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/antitrust-division-establishes-jackson-nash-address-and-announces-professor-alvin-roth.)\u00a0 Through extraordinary, distinguished guest speakers, we recognize and celebrate the role of economics in advancing the objectives of the antitrust laws and the mission of the Division.\u00a0 In so doing, the series will honor the weighty contributions to the field of antitrust from former Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson and Nobel laureate economist John Nash.\u00a0 We were proud to have our inaugural address feature Alvin Roth, also a Nobel Prize winning economist, who is lauded for his important contributions to game theory and market design that shaped the way medical students are matched with residency programs and patients are matched with kidney donors.\u00a0 Our second address featured George Akerloff, another Nobel Prize winning economist, who is lauded for his important contributions to markets characterized by asymmetric information, such as markets for lemons, and John Q. Barrett, a professor of law at St. John\u2019s University who is writing a biography on Justice Jackson.\n\nLooking to the Future\n\nIt is indeed an exciting time to be at the Antitrust Division as we work to achieve important results for American consumers.\u00a0 One of the not-so-secret secrets to our success is our talented and devoted staff.\u00a0 It is critical that the Division continues to attract and retain bright, talented, and passionate individuals\u2014whether they be attorneys, economists, paralegals, or support staff.\n\nOne way we will draw talent is through the recently established James F. Rill Fellowship Program.\u00a0 (The James F. Rill Fellowship, Antitrust Div., U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice,https://www.justice.gov/oarm/james-f-rill-fellowship(last updated Aug. 13, 2018).)\u00a0 The Fellowship is designed to provide elite candidates of the Honors Program with a special opportunity to participate in antitrust enforcement actions and in the development and implementation of antitrust policy.\u00a0 I feel fortunate that through this fellowship I can honor one of the greats in the antitrust field, a man whose contributions span public service and private practice, administrations of all stripes, and the field of competition law not just domestically but across the globe.\u00a0 I hope that the fellowship will draw future great contributors to the field of antitrust.\u00a0 I look forward to working with this Committee on finding further means to ensure the Antitrust Division has the resources and talent it needs to protect and promote competition.\n\nConclusion\n\nI have been the AAG of the Antitrust Division for one year and one week now, and it has been an exhilarating experience.\u00a0 I am honored to have the support of this Committee, and to be working with the dedicated women and men of the Antitrust Division to protect American consumers.\u00a0 We have done much, but much more remains to be done.\u00a0 I look forward to the coming challenges, knowing the importance of our work.\n\nMr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to speak here today.\u00a0 I look forward to further discussion of these issues.",

FlanagansentencedKURT MICHAEL KROL,36, ofFayetteville, North Carolinato 72 months imprisonment, followed by3years of supervised release. Additionally,KROLagreed to forfeit to the government all counterfeit articles seized; proceeds of $156,932 seized from four BB&T bank accounts, proceeds of $51,988 seized from two USAA bank accounts; a residence located in Fayetteville; a residence located in Raeford; and a money judgment in the amount of the gross proceeds of the offense.\n\n\n\nKROLwas named ina Criminal Informationfiled onOctober 14, 2015, which charged him withtrafficking in counterfeit goods from September 2012 to February 2015.On December 15, 2015,KROLpled guilty to the charge.\n\n\n\nThe investigation revealed that on January 22, 2008,KROLfounded Universal Mania, Inc. (UM), an internet based marketplace for consumer electronics located in Fayetteville.KROL, president and CEO of UM, initially sold legitimate consumer electronic equipment; however, in 2011 or 2012, he was introduced to a representative of a company in Hong Kong, China, that sold counterfeit Otterbox products (OBP). Thereafter,KROLbegan purchasing counterfeit OBP from that company.\n\n\n\nOn October 31, 2012, Otterbox alleged that UM had infringed on their federal trademark registrations. UM subsequently filed a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment against Otterbox in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina on February 8, 2013. Otterbox filed a counter-claim on April 12, 2013. On December 17, 2013, the court entered a Consent Judgment ordering UM to pay Otterbox $200,000 for trademark infringement. The court also entered a permanent injunction, prohibiting UM from the unauthorized use of any Otterbox trademark.\n\n\n\nHowever, the investigation discovered thatKROLmet with a representative from the Chinese company in Fayetteville to find out what products they could counterfeit.KROLthen imported counterfeit products including L\u2019Oreal (Clarisonic), HSI Professional, and Conair (Babyliss) beauty products; Garmin products; Choon\u2019s Design (Rainbow Loom) toys; Philips (Sonicare) products; Zing Anything bottles; Harman International Industries (JBL), LG, and Bose speakers and/or headphones; and Spectrum Brands FURminator dog brushes. The investigation found that 2,047 shipments originating in Hong Kong were addressed to KROL between August 2012 and February 2015.\n\n\n\nKROLsold counterfeit merchandise, as well as merchandise from legitimate distributors on the internet. He comingled the sales proceeds from the counterfeit products with proceeds from legitimate sales. When one internet business discovered UM was selling counterfeit items through its website, they terminated UM\u2019s accounts.KROLthen solicited UM employees, friends, and family members to establish accounts on the website to sell UM\u2019s counterfeit products.\n\n\n\n\u201cDefendants such as Krol while trafficking in counterfeit goods, undermine our fair trade and free market system to generate illicit proceeds,\u201d said HSI North Carolina Assistant Special Agent in Charge Christopher Healy, \u201cThis significant sentence will let people, such as Krol, know that this illegal activity impacts not only our national economy but the local economies where these illegal traffickers operate.\u201d\n\n\n\nBetween October 2013 and January 2015, agents with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) seized counterfeit items from several different locations. During the execution of a search warrant at UM on February 25, 2015, HSI agents seized multiple counterfeit products andKROLacknowledged that he sold counterfeit items, despite the Otterbox civil judgment against him, the receipt of numerous seizure notices from DHS, and warnings from an online distributor.\n\n\n\nThis investigation was conducted by HSI in Raleigh.",

            "article_text": "Roanoke, VIRGINIA \u2013 A former Virginia Tech professor studying artificial sweeteners was found guilty last week of conspiring to commit federal grant fraud, making false statements and obstruction by falsification, First Assistant United States Attorney Daniel P. Bubar announced today.\n\nChief Judge Michael F. Urbanski of the Western District of Virginia released his Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law February 20, 2019 in which he found Yiheng Percival Zhang, 47, of Blacksburg, Va., guilty of one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, three counts of making false statements, and one count of obstruction by falsification. The ruling comes following a September 2018 bench trial in U.S. District Court in Roanoke.\n\n\u201cThis verdict shows our commitment to hold individuals accountable who seek to fraudulently obtain federal funds. \u00a0Mr. Zhang used his position of prominence to unlawfully seek money from federal grant programs and will now pay for it,\u201d FAUSA Bubar said today. \u201cI am proud of our team of investigators and prosecutors that worked tirelessly to ensure that tax payer dollars are not being misused.\u201d\n\n\u201cSmall Business Innovation Research (SBIR) \u00a0and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) grants are intended to promote scientific innovation in the private sector by providing capital to entrepreneurial teams at a very early stage when the technological risk associated with their ideas generally precludes private sector funding,\u201d said Allison Lerner, Inspector General for the National Science Foundation (NSF). \u201cThe NSF Office of Inspector General remains committed to ensuring the integrity of the SBIR/STTR programs by holding accountable those who attempt to hide behind sophisticated schemes aimed at diverting Federal research funds.\u00a0I commend the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and our investigative partners for their strong support in this effort.\u201d\n\nAccording to evidence presented at trial, Zhang, who at the time of the offenses was a biological systems engineering professor at Virginia Tech, founded Cell-Free Bioinnovations, Inc. (\u201cCFB\u201d), a research firm located in Blacksburg, Virginia. CFB relied exclusively on federal grants for funding its research activities. Zhang began working as a paid researcher for the Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences by, at least, 2014.\u00a0 In 2015, Zhang caused fraudulent grant proposals to be submitted to the NSF. Evidence presented at trial indicated grant funds obtained would be used for research Zhang knew had already been done in China. Zhang intended to use the grant funds for other CFB projects rather than for the projects for which the funds were requested. To obstruct the investigation, Zhang submitted falsified timesheets to government investigators.\n\nThe investigation of the case was conducted by the Department of Energy-Office of the Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the National Science Foundation-Office of the Inspector General with the assistance of the Blacksburg Police Department and the Virginia Tech Police Department.\u00a0 Assistant United States Attorneys Steve Pfleger and Randy Ramseyer prosecuted the case for the United States.",

            "article_text": "SAN JOSE \u2013 Hao Zhang, 41, of China, was found guilty of economic espionage, theft of trade secrets, and conspiring to commit both offenses today, announced the Department of Justice.\u00a0 The ruling was handed down by the Honorable Edward J. Davila, U.S. District Judge, following a four-day bench trial.\n\nEvidence submitted during the course of the trial demonstrated that from 2010 to 2015, Zhang conspired to and did steal trade secrets from two companies: Avago, a designer, developer, and global supplier of a broad range of analog, digital, mixed signal and optoelectronics components and subsystems with a focus in semiconductor design and processing, headquartered in San Jose, California, and Singapore; and Skyworks, an innovator of high performance analog semiconductors headquartered in Woburn, Massachusetts.\u00a0 Judge Davila found that Zhang intended to steal the trade secrets for the benefit of the People\u2019s Republic of China\n\n\u201cA free nation is naturally innovative.\u00a0 No nation is more innovative than the United States.\u00a0 Countries without freedom cannot match our innovation, and inevitably must resort to theft.\u00a0 Theft is not innovation.\u00a0 By combatting theft, we protect innovation and freedom,\u201d said U.S. Attorney David L. Anderson for the Northern District of California.\n\n\u201cThe defendant plotted with Tianjin University to take trade secrets from two U.S. companies, including his own employer, to China for the benefit of the Chinese Government,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers.\u00a0 \u201cToday\u2019s guilty verdict on all counts is an important step in holding accountable an individual who robbed his U.S. employer of trade secrets and sought to replicate the company\u2019s technology and replace its market share.\u00a0 The Department of Justice\u2019s commitment to prosecuting these cases should serve as a cautionary tale to anyone considering doing the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cEconomic Espionage is a pervasive threat throughout the United States, particularly to the San Francisco Bay Area and Silicon Valley which is the center of innovation and technology,\u201d said FBI Special Agent in Charge John F. Bennett.\u00a0 \u201cWhile this case exemplifies how easily a few motivated employees can conspire to misappropriate intellectual property for the benefit of the People\u2019s Republic of China, Zhang\u2019s conviction should serve as a warning to our adversaries that the FBI and our partners remain committed to aggressively investigating and prosecuting these crimes.\u201d\n\nAccording evidence presented during the bench trial, Zhang stole trade secrets relating the performance of wireless devices.\u00a0 Specifically, Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) and Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW) filters are used in wireless devices to eliminate interference and improve other aspects of device performance.\u00a0 Film Bulk Acoustic Resonators (FBAR) are one type of BAW filter.\u00a0 The most common and most profitable application of FBAR technology is as a radio frequency (RF) filter for mobile phones and other wireless devices.\u00a0 Technological advances in FBARs have played a substantial role in creating smaller, more efficient wireless devices for both consumer and military applications.\u00a0 Avago, one of the victims of Zhang\u2019s theft, was the leading company in the United States manufacturing and selling FBARs.\u00a0 Zhang\u2019s other victim, Skyworks, was developing its own BAW technology.\n\nEvidence at trial further showed that in October 2006, Zhang and his co-conspirators started a business in China to compete with Avago and Skyworks.\u00a0 One of Zhang\u2019s co-conspirators, Wei Pang, started working at Avago at the same time.\u00a0 Zhang and Pang illicitly shared trade secrets with each other and with co-conspirators in China while they worked for the U.S. companies.\u00a0 Zhang and Pang then connected their venture to Tianjin University (TJU) in China, an instrumentality of the Chinese government.\u00a0 By 2009, they left their work in the United States to relocate to China, following a plan laid out by TJU officials to form another company, Novana, in the Cayman Islands.\u00a0 Along the way, Zhang obtained patents in his own name using trade secret information he knew was stolen from Avago.\u00a0 Zhang also worked with stolen trade secrets in a lab he founded at TJU while developing his new FBAR business.\n\nThe FBAR processes that Zhang and his co-conspirators stole took Avago over twenty years of research and development to build.\u00a0 Additional evidence during the bench trial demonstrated that Zhang engaged in economic espionage to help TJU and Zhang\u2019s Chinese company unfairly compete in the multi-billion dollar global market for cell phone RF filters.\n\nZhang was charged in a superseding indictment returned by a federal grand jury on April 1, 2015.\n\nZhang is currently released on a $500,000 secured bond.\n\nZhang\u2019s sentencing hearing is scheduled for Aug. 31, 2020, before Judge Davila in San San Jose.\u00a0 The maximum statutory penalty for each count in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01831 is 15 years in custody and a fine of $250,000, plus restitution if appropriate.\u00a0 The maximum statutory penalty for each count in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01832 is 10 years in custody and a fine of $250,000, plus restitution if appropriate. \u00a0However, any sentence will be imposed by the court after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553.\n\nMichelle J. Kane and Susan Knight are the Assistant U.S. Attorneys who are prosecuting the case with the assistance of Rebecca Shelton, Susan Kreider, and Laurie Worthen.\u00a0 The prosecution is the result of an investigation by the FBI.",

Xi, a naturalized U.S. citizen and a native of the People\u2019s Republic of China, is a world-renowned expert in the field of magnesium diboride thin film superconducting technology. The fraud, it is alleged, was an effort to assist Chinese entities in becoming world leaders of the superconductivity field.\n\n\n\nThe charges were announced today by United States Attorney Zane David Memeger, and FBI Special Agent-in-Charge Edward J. Hanko.\n\n\n\nThe indictment alleges that, in 2002, Xi participated in China\u2019s 863 Program, which was a Chinese government program intended to boost high-technology innovation and development in China. Thereafter, in 2002 to 2003, the indictment alleges that Xi took a sabbatical from his university position and worked with a U.S. company in the field of thin film superconductivity research. During his tenure at the company, individuals there invented a piece of technology which revolutionized the field of superconducting magnesium diboride thin film growth. The indictment alleges that, starting in January 2004, Xi made efforts to obtain the technology from the company. The indictment further alleges that Xi applied for and was awarded a U.S. Defense Department grant to finance his purchase of the device for research relevant to the Department of Defense. In January 2006, Xi obtained the device for 12 months subject to an agreement that he not reproduce, sell, transfer or otherwise distribute the device or any copies of the device to any third party. The indictment alleges that Xi signed this agreement as part of a scheme to defraud the company into providing him the technology, so that he could provide it to entities in China and assist those entities in further exploitation and use of the technology. The indictment further alleges that Xi repeatedly reproduced, sold, transferred, distributed, and otherwise shared the device with, and exploited it for the benefit of, government entities and other third parties in China. It is further alleged that, in exchange for his efforts, Xi repeatedly sought lucrative and prestigious appointments in China.\n\n\n\nAccording to the indictment, Xi\u2019s emails include a communication on May 14, 2010, to an associate in China, confirming the delivery of certain technology to a laboratory in China; and three emails to separate associates in China, in June 2010 and December 2010, in which Xi offers to build a world-class thin film laboratory.\n\n\n\nIf convicted the defendant faces a maximum possible sentence of 80 years in prison, three years of supervised release, a fine of up to $1 million, and a $400 special assessment.\n\n\n\nThe case was investigated by the FBI and is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Jennifer Arbittier Williams.\n\n\n\nAn Indictment is an accusation.\u00a0 A defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.",

Stewart for the Middle District of Alabama, and Acting Assistant Attorney General Mark J. Lesko of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division.\n\nAccording to court documents, Xiaoming Zhang, 69, a naturalized citizen of Chinese descent living in Montgomery, Alabama, began working as an Air War College (AWC) professor in July 2003. During his tenure at the AWC, Zhang would travel to China on a regular basis for work-related purposes, research and to visit family living there.\n\nBeginning sometime in 2012, Zhang developed a relationship with a known foreign official working with the Shanghai Municipal Government. Records indicate that Zhang met with the official in person on approximately six occasions and exchanged approximately 40 emails with him from December 2012 to January 2017. At some point during this period, Zhang became aware that the official was using, or attempting to use, their relationship to gain access to sensitive information in Zhang\u2019s possession, as well as to make contact with other potentially valuable individuals.\n\nAs part of his employment at the AWC, Zhang held a \u201csecret\u201d security clearance and attended annual security training that informed him of reporting requirements about suspicious foreign contacts and relationships with foreign government officials, along with other briefings concerning reporting requirements. Despite all the trainings and briefings, Zhang failed to report the relationship with the foreign official even after he came to understand that the official was attempting to gather sensitive information from Zhang.\n\nAccording to the factual basis contained in the plea agreement, Zhang made multiple misleading or false statements to authorities in an attempt to hide his relationship with the Chinese official. In August of 2017, Zhang denied knowing the foreign official when questioned by U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigators who were verifying his continued eligibility for a security clearance. When the FBI interviewed Zhang in July of 2020, he initially made more false statements, but eventually admitted to meeting with the official in China on numerous occasions and to being untruthful concerning that information. Zhang also acknowledged that he had concealed the relationship with the official because he knew it was improper.\n\nZhang pleaded guilty to making false statements to a federal agent and faces a maximum of five years in prison at sentencing. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nThe FBI investigated the case, with valuable assistance provided by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, the Department of the Air Force\u2019s Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), and the Department of Defense.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Brett Talley of the Middle District of Alabama is prosecuting the case with assistance from Trial Attorney Scott Claffee of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.",

From 2010 to 2012, Lin and others, including a former member of the United States Marine Corps and National Guard, exported multiple shipments of high-powered firearms from the United States to China.\u00a0 Lin and his accomplices secreted the weapons in packages and transported them to shipping companies in Queens, New York, and elsewhere, to be sent to Shanghai, China\u2019s largest city.\u00a0 The weapons included dozens of semi-automatic handguns, rifles, shotguns, and military-style assault weapons.\n\nThe sentence was announced by Loretta E.

According to court documents, Zheng was employed at GE Power in Schenectady, New York, as an engineer specializing in turbine sealing technology.\u00a0He worked at GE from 2008 until the summer of 2018. The trial evidence demonstrated that Zheng and others in China conspired to steal GE\u2019s trade secrets surrounding GE\u2019s ground-based and aviation-based turbine technologies, knowing or intending to benefit the PRC and one or more foreign instrumentalities, including China-based companies and universities that research, develop, and manufacture parts for turbines.\n\n\u201cThis is a case of textbook economic espionage. Zheng exploited his position of trust, betrayed his employer and conspired with the government of China to steal innovative American technology,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G.

            "article_text": "PORTLAND, Ore.\u2014A Pennsylvania man who completed more than 7,800 individual darknet fentanyl sales in less than two years and was linked by investigators to dozens of fatal overdoses across the United States was sentenced to life in federal prison today for distributing a fentanyl analogue on AlphaBay, a former darknet marketplace, that caused the overdoses of three people in Oregon, two of whom died.\n\nHenry Konah Koffie, 38, of Darby, Pennsylvania, was sentenced to life in federal prison and three years\u2019 supervised release.\n\n\u201cHenry Koffie\u2019s overdose victims purchased fentanyl from him on the darknet for as much as $40 a gram, waited for it to arrive, consumed it, and tragically overdosed. Today, individuals seeking fentanyl need only walk to a nearby street corner and hand over a dollar or two for a similar quantity. In many ways, it is darknet dealers like Henry Koffie who paved the way for the fentanyl crisis still gripping our communities,\u201d said Natalie Wight, U.S. Attorney for the District of Oregon. \u201cWe know no sentence can heal the trauma experienced by families who have lost loved ones, but it is our hope that today\u2019s sentence, and knowing Henry Koffie cannot take any more innocent lives, will bring some degree of closure for them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile no sentence can bring back the lives lost to the blatant indifference and outright greed of this drug trafficker, he will no longer pose a threat to communities across the country,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Robert Hammer, overseeing Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) operations in the Pacific Northwest. \u201cIn less than two years, Koffie used the darknet to conduct thousands of drug transactions that could have resulted in more fentanyl overdose deaths. Through our numerous partnerships with local and federal law enforcement, HSI will continue conducting investigations to unveil the anonymity drug dealers attempt to use to avoid getting caught while selling deadly illicit narcotics.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s sentencing of Henry Koffie, the culmination of a collaborative effort between federal and local law enforcement agencies in Portland, we see justice prevail. The United States Postal Inspection Service extends its gratitude to the Portland Police Bureau, Homeland Security Investigations, and the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for their invaluable partnerships that led to the conviction of this purveyor of death on a national scale. Henry Koffie's reckless actions, demonstrating a blatant disregard for the lives of others, are reprehensible and have now met their reckoning,\u201d said Tony Galetti, Inspector in Charge of the United States Postal Inspection Service (USPIS), Seattle Division. \u201cToday's verdict is a resolute statement that such behavior will not go unpunished. Our thoughts are with the victims and their families, hoping that this outcome brings them a measure of closure and marks the beginning of the healing process.\u201d\n\n\u201cFentanyl has killed and destroyed too many lives in our community,\u201d said Bob Day, Chief of the Portland Police Bureau (PPB). \u201cWe want to thank our partners for joining efforts to investigate and prosecute this important case. Combatting dangerous illegal drugs in our community remains a priority as we work to prevent further heartbreaking and senseless deaths. I also want to extend my sincere sympathy to the families of the victims and hope today\u2019s sentencing brings some comfort to them.\u201d\n\nAccording to court documents, in just over a year, three Portland residents overdosed on furanyl fentanyl supplied by Koffie, a darknet narcotics vendor known as DNMKingpin and later Narcoboss on AlphaBay. The first victim was a 19-year-old student at Portland State University who, on May 2, 2016, overdosed 30 minutes after ingesting powdered furanyl fentanyl. Paramedics administered Naloxone and breathing assistance to the student, saving her life. Investigators interviewed the student\u2019s source who said he supplied the student with the powdered furanyl fentanyl he purchased from DNMKingpin on AlphaBay.\n\nOne year later, on May 6, 2017, PPB officers responded to a fatal overdose of a 27-year-old in southeast Portland. The victim\u2019s roommates told the officers that the victim had ordered fentanyl from Narcoboss on AlphaBay who had advertised the furanyl fentanyl as \u201cChina White.\u201d One roommate further told officers that he and the victim had ordered a gram of fentanyl from Narcoboss for $40 and that it had arrived in a USPS priority mail envelope shipped from Philadelphia.\n\nThree weeks later, on May 29, 2017, PPB officers responded to a fatal overdose of another 27-year-old who had resided in northeast Portland. Officers located a small vial of furanyl fentanyl in the victim\u2019s residence as well as a notebook containing information on accessing AlphaBay and a Bitcoin wallet. They further located an envelope in the victim\u2019s trash can with a return address in Philadelphia.\n\nBetween May 25 and June 21, 2017, investigators conducted five controlled buys of powdered fentanyl from Narcoboss. All five orders were fulfilled from addresses in and around Philadelphia. Around the same time, investigators in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania located and identified Koffie\u2019s fingerprints on packages of furanyl fentanyl resembling those shipped to law enforcement in Portland that were purchased from AlphaBay via Narcoboss.\n\nFurther investigation revealed that between April 6, 2016, and May 23, 2017, Koffie received 14 packages of furanyl fentanyl totaling approximately seven kilograms from distributors in China and Hong Kong. In May and June of 2017, two additional packages shipped to Koffie containing another half kilogram of furanyl fentanyl were intercepted by United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP). It was later determined that Koffie used an online postage company called Stampnik to purchase more than 5,700 postage labels he used to ship furanyl fentanyl throughout the United States, including the labels affixed to parcels seized in Oregon, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania.\n\nIn just under two years, Koffie used AlphaBay to sell approximately 43 pounds of furanyl fentanyl in 7,849 individual transactions to customers in all 50 states. In addition to the three overdoses Koffie was convicted of causing in Oregon, investigators identified at least 27 other people who ordered furanyl fentanyl from Koffie and, shortly after, overdosed and died. Koffie was also linked to 27 other non-fatal overdoses.\n\nOn July 12, 2017, Koffie was charged by criminal complaint in the District of Oregon with distribution of a controlled substance resulting in serious bodily injury or death. Later, on April 21, 2021, he was charged by superseding indictment with conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance, distribution of a controlled substance resulting in serious bodily injury, distribution of a controlled substance resulting in death, and distribution of a controlled substance.\n\nOn March 7, 2023, a federal jury found Koffie guilty on two counts of distribution of a controlled substance resulting in death, one count of distribution of a controlled substance resulting in serious bodily injury, and five counts of distribution of a controlled substance.\n\nKoffie is under federal indictment in two other judicial districts. On August 1, 2017, a federal grand jury in the Western District of Pennsylvania returned an indictment charging Koffie with four counts of distributing a controlled substance. On September 20, 2017, a federal grand jury in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania returned a two-count indictment charging Koffie with distributing a controlled substance and distributing a controlled substance within 1,000 feet of a playground. Both cases are pending.\n\nThis case was investigated by HSI, USPIS, and PPB with assistance from the FBI, Oregon-Idaho High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) task force, CBP, Philadelphia Police Department, and Pennsylvania State Police. It was prosecuted by Scott M. Kerin, Parakram Singh, and Andrew T. Ho, Assistant U.S. Attorneys for the District of Oregon.\n\nOn July 20, 2017, the Justice Department, in partnership with the FBI, United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), HSI and IRS-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI), seized and shut down AlphaBay, which, at the time, was the largest criminal marketplace online. At the time of its seizure, AlphaBay had operated for over two years on the darknet and was used to sell illegal drugs, stolen and fraudulent identification documents and access devices, counterfeit goods, malware and other hacking tools, firearms, and toxic chemicals throughout the world.\n\nIf you or someone you know suffers from addiction, please call the Lines for Life substance abuse helpline at 1-800-923-4357 or visitwww.linesforlife.org.

            "article_text": "WASHINGTON\u2014 The Department of Justice announced today that Van Andel Research Institute (VARI) has agreed to pay $5,500,000.00 to resolve allegations that it violated the False Claims Act by submitting federal grant applications and progress reports to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in which VARI failed to disclose Chinese government grants that funded two VARI researchers.\u00a0 The settlement further resolves allegations that in a Dec. 21, 2018 letter, VARI made certain factual representations to NIH with deliberate ignorance or reckless disregard for the truth regarding the Chinese grants.\n\nAndrew Birge, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Michigan, said, \u201cOur local institutions, like VARI, serve a vital role in raising West Michigan\u2019s profile as a national player in cutting-edge biomedical research, but institutions everywhere must deal honestly and transparently when applying for U.S. government funding and respond appropriately when compliance issues arise. It\u2019s unfair to other grant applicants and to the NIH for any institution to withhold requested information about whether the research that an institution wants the NIH to support may be getting funding from outside sources, specifically including foreign governments. False Claims Act penalties are harsh by design. I sincerely hope the word gets out on the importance of full disclosure with the government.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that recipients of NIH grant funds properly report all sources of research support, financial interests and affiliations of individual researchers to ensure the proper and effective use of taxpayer dollars,\u201d said Lamont Pugh III, Special Agent in Charge of HHS-OIG\u2019s Chicago Region.\u00a0 \u201cHHS-OIG will continue to investigate allegations of failures to properly report information to ensure the integrity of Departmental programs.\u201d\n\nObtaining research funding from NIH is a highly competitive process, with only a small portion of eligible applications receiving funding each year.\u00a0\u00a0 Nondisclosures and false statements to granting agencies are especially harmful because they distort competition, disadvantage applicants who play by the rules, and undermine agencies\u2019 decision-making on the use of their limited resources.\n\nAs part of its grants application process, NIH requires recipient institutions to disclose all financial resources\u2014including any other research grants\u2014that are available to researchers and other key research personnel in support of their research endeavors (known as \u201cOther Support\u201d disclosures).\u00a0 Other Support disclosures allow NIH to independently evaluate, among other things, whether research submitted for taxpayer support is being funded by another source.\u00a0 During the term of a grant, NIH also requires recipient institutions to disclose whether certain aspects of federally-funded research will be, or have been, performed outside of the United States (known as \u201cForeign Component\u201d disclosures). Research institutions, which apply for NIH grants on behalf of researchers and groups of collaborating researchers, make these Other Support and Foreign Component disclosures on or in connection with NIH forms.\n\nVARI is an independent research institute in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\u00a0 Between Jan. 1, 2012, and Aug. 31, 2019, VARI received NIH grants for two researchers, including a researcher identified here as \u201cProfessor 1.\u201d\u00a0 The government alleged that in applying for the NIH grants, and in submitting claims for federal grant funds, VARI did not disclose any foreign research funding for those researchers or any foreign components of their NIH-sponsored research.\u00a0 The government alleged, however, that both researchers received research funding from Chinese sources while VARI was applying for and receiving NIH funds on their behalf.\u00a0 The government specifically alleged that between Jan. 2012 and Dec. 2018, Professor 1 received grants and research support from a variety of Chinese sources, including the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s Thousand Talents Program.\u00a0 The Thousand Talents Program is in place with the purpose of returning talent, research, and technology to China for China\u2019s benefit.\n\nThe government claimed that between Jan. 2012 and June 2018, VARI should have known about these foreign grants and disclosed them to NIH.\u00a0 The government alleged that while VARI had institutional policies and procedures in place to address conflicts of interest, VARI did not take adequate additional steps to investigate the researchers\u2019 foreign funding sources despite receiving specific information about their Chinese affiliations.\u00a0 The government claimed, for example, that a Chinese institution sent VARI a letter stating that Professor 1 was receiving \u201cgenerous support\u201d from the Chinese Thousand Talents Program.\u00a0 The government also alleged that VARI knew that Professor 1 held a directorship at a Shanghai-based research institute\u2014a collaboration between VARI and the Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica\u2014that would involve Professor 1 applying for Chinese research grants to support work at the foreign institution.\n\nThe government claimed that VARI learned about certain of Professor 1\u2019s Chinese grants in June 2018 while reviewing a press release for one of Professor 1\u2019s publications. \u00a0The government claimed that rather than confirming and disclosing the information to the NIH, VARI removed references to those grants from the proposed funding attributions in its press release.\u00a0 The government alleged that shortly thereafter, VARI received an Aug. 20, 2018 letter from NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D. that reminded recipient institutions of the need to disclose \u201csupport coming from foreign governments or other foreign entities\u201d for their researchers.\u00a0 The government alleged that VARI then received a Nov. 30, 2018 e-mail from NIH that cited specific concerns about potential nondisclosures relating to Professor 1.\u00a0 The government claimed that VARI did not disclose Professor 1\u2019s Chinese grants to NIH even after receiving this correspondence.\n\nThe government claimed that VARI instead retained an outside consulting firm, and, relying on that firm\u2019s advice, sent a Dec. 21, 2018 letter to NIH in which VARI stated that it was not required to disclose information about Professor 1\u2019s foreign grants because \u201cthere was no undisclosed overlap of any budgetary resources, commitment, or scientific endeavor\u201d between the Chinese grants and the NIH grants.\u00a0 NIH, however, requires disclosure of all financial resources available in support of an individual\u2019s research endeavors.\u00a0 The government further alleged that VARI, in representing to the agency that \u201cthere was no undisclosed overlap\u201d between the Chinese grants and the NIH grants, did not know whether that statement was true.\n\nU.S. Attorney Birge added that institutions concerned about a prior statement on a grant application should know that it is Department of Justice policy that entities or individuals that make \u201cproactive, timely, and voluntary self-disclosures to the Department about misconduct will receive credit during the resolution of a False Claims Act case.\u201d\n\nThis case was a cooperative effort among HHS-OIG, the FBI, and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Michigan.\u00a0 Assistant U.S. Attorney Adam B. Townshend represented the United States\n\nThe claims resolved by the settlements are allegations only.\u00a0 There has been no determination of liability.\n\n\n\n###",

            "article_text": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2013 Jonathan Yet Wing Soong pleaded guilty today to violating export control laws in connection with a scheme to secretly funnel sensitive aeronautics software to a Beijing university, announced United States Attorney Stephanie M. Hinds; Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent in Charge Robert K. Tripp; Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, Office of Export Enforcement (BIS), Special Agent in Charge John D. Masters; Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) Special Agent in Charge Bryan D. Denny. The plea was accepted by the Hon. Susan Illston, United States District Judge.\n\nBetween August 2016 and September 2020, Soong, 35, of Castro Valley, Calif., was employed as a program administrator by Universities Space Research Association (USRA), a nonprofit research corporation focusing on advancing space science and technology. In April of 2016, USRA contracted with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to, among other things, license and distribute aeronautics-related Army flight control software for a fee. Soong\u2019s duties included, among other things, conducting and servicing software license sales, conducting export compliance screening of customers, generating software licenses, and exporting software pursuant to purchased licenses. As part of his duties, Soong was responsible for vetting customers to ensure they did not appear on certain restrictive lists\u2014including the Department of Commerce\u2019s Entity List and other U.S. government lists\u2014that placed limitations on the transfer of products to identified entities. In pleading guilty, Soong admitted that he willingly exported and facilitated the sale and transfer of restricted software to Beihang University knowing that the university was on the Department of Commerce\u2019s Entity List. According to government filings in the case, Beihang University was added to the Entity List due to the University\u2019s involvement in People\u2019s Republic of China military rocket systems and unmanned air vehicle systems. In his plea agreement, Soong acknowledged he used an intermediary to complete the export of the program to avoid detection that the real purchaser was on the Entity List.\n\nAt issue in the case is a software package referred to as CIFER, a tool that allows a user to develop a dynamic model of an aircraft, based on collective flight test data using system identification techniques. According to government filings, the package could be used to analyze and design aircraft control systems. According to his plea agreement, Soong was aware in April of 2017 that the CIFER software was subject to Export Administration Regulations and that Beihang University was on the Entity List thus making it necessary to obtain a license prior to exporting the CIFER software to the university. Soong acknowledged that he nonetheless arranged to sell and transfer the CIFER software package to the entity without obtaining a license.\n\nThe plea agreement describes how, on May 1, 2017, a representative of the university communicated with Soong and expressed an interest in exploring an arrangement in which rather than use Beihang University as the purchaser of the CIFER software, the purchase would be made in the name of a third-party small company. For the next several months, Soong communicated with the representative and then, in late 2017, Soong communicated with a representative from Beijing Rainbow Technical Development Ltd. (Beijing Rainbow), identified as being the third-party intermediary for the sale of the CIFER software to Beihang University. Soong ultimately exported directly to Beihang University. In July 2018, Soong also arranged to have the passcodes for the CIFER software package forwarded to Beihang University with payment coming from Beijing Rainbow.\n\nOn September 26, 2022, Soong was charged by information with one count of violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), in violation of 50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1702 and 1705. Pursuant to today\u2019s agreement, Soong pleaded guilty to the count.\n\nThe IEEPA violation carries a statutory maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $1,000,000 fine. In addition, as part of any sentence, the court may order restitution and up to three years of supervised release. However, any sentence after conviction will be imposed by the court only after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553.\n\nSoong remains out of custody pending sentencing. Judge Illston scheduled Soong\u2019s sentencing hearing for April 28, 2023. Assistant United States Attorney Barbara Valliere of the United States Attorney\u2019s Office\u2019s Special Prosecutions Section is prosecuting the case with the assistance of Maddi Wachs and Kathy Tat. The prosecution is the result of an investigation by the BIS, DCIS, and the FBI with assistance from the NASA Office of Inspector General; U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Division; the U.S. Army Counterintelligence; and the Department of Homeland Security, Homeland Security Investigations.",

            "article_text": "Yu Long, 38, a citizen of China and lawful permanent resident of the U.S., waived his right to be indicted and pleaded guilty today in New Haven federal court in Connecticut, to charges related to his theft of numerous sensitive military program documents from United Technologies and transporting them to China.\n\nLong pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to engage in the theft of trade secrets knowing that the offense would benefit a foreign government, foreign instrumentality or foreign agent, an offense that carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 15 years. He also pleaded guilty to one count of unlawful export and attempted export of defense articles from the U.S. in violation of the Arms Export Control Act, an offense that carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years. The maximum statutory sentence is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes. If convicted of any offense, the sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the court based on the advisory Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nThe announcement was made by Acting Assistant Attorney General for National Security Mary B. McCord, U.S. Attorney Deirdre M. Daly for the District of Connecticut, Special Agent in Charge Matthew Etre of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in Boston, Massachusetts, Special Agent in Charge Craig W. Rupert of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) Northeast Field Office, Special Agent in Charge Patricia M. Ferrick of the FBI\u2019s New Haven Division and Special Agent in Charge Danielle Angley with the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI).\n\n\u201cLong admitted to stealing and exploiting highly sensitive military technology and documents, knowing his theft would benefit China\u2019s defense industry and deliberately contravene the embargo on U.S. Munitions List technology the United States has imposed on China,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General McCord. \u201cExport laws exist as an important part of our national security framework and disrupting and prosecuting this kind of economic espionage is one of the National Security Division\u2019s highest priorities.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn an effort to further his own career, this defendant stole an extraordinary amount of proprietary military program information from United Technologies and transported much of that stolen information to China,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Daly. \u201cHis actions, which he knew would benefit China, not only violated his employment agreement and damaged the company, but have threatened our country's national security interests. U.S. companies continue to be targeted by those who seek to steal intellectual property, trade secrets and advanced defense technology \u2013 whether through a computer hack or cyber intrusion, or through a rogue employee. Working closely with our nation\u2019s defense contractors, we will relentlessly investigate and prosecute those who steal, or attempt to steal, trade secrets and sensitive military information, whether for their own personal gain or for the benefit of foreign actors.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese sophisticated technologies are highly sought after by our adversaries,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Etre. \u201cThey were developed to give the United States and its allies a distinct military advantage, which is why HSI and our law enforcement partners will continue to aggressively target the individuals who steal the ideas of others and sell these items.\u201d\n\n\"Today's plea demonstrates the commitment of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service and our federal law enforcement partners to identifying those who illegally export sensitive defense information to adversarial Foreign governments,\" said Special Agent in Charge Rupert. \"DCIS will continue to safeguard sensitive technology and to shield America's investment in national defense by disrupting efforts of groups and individuals who try to illegally acquire our national security assets.\"\n\n\u201cThis case highlights the complexity in which the FBI and law enforcement are being challenged to keep the integrity of our industry intellectual property intact,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Ferrick. \u201cInvestigating criminal activity of this nature will continue to be a priority.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis case was enabled by the outstanding teamwork of the FBI, DCIS, HSI, AFOSI and the U.S. Attorney's office,\u201d said, Special Agent in Charge Angley. \u201cIn addition, it demonstrates the focus of law enforcement agencies to protect our nation's critical resources.\u201d\n\nAccording to court documents and statements made in court, from approximately May 2008 to May 2014, Long worked as a Senior Engineer/Scientist at United Technologies Research Center (UTRC) in Connecticut. Long\u2019s employment at UTRC included work on F119 and F135 engines. The F119 engine is employed by the U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptor fighter aircraft, and the F135 engine is employed by the U.S. Air Force F-35 Lightning II fighter aircraft.\n\nBeginning in 2013, Long expressed his intent to individuals outside UTRC to return to China to work on research projects at certain state-run universities in China using knowledge and materials he had acquired while employed at the UTRC. To that end, Long interacted with several state-run institutions in China, including the Chinese Academy of Science (CAS) and the Shenyang Institute of Automation (SIA), a state-run university in China affiliated with CAS.\n\nDuring 2013 and 2014, Long was recruited by SIA and other state-run universities, during which he leveraged information that he had obtained while working at UTRC to seek employment in China, culminating in his travel to China in the possession of voluminous documents and data containing highly sensitive intellectual property, trade secrets and export controlled technology, which he had unlawfully stolen from UTRC.\n\nIn December 2013, after Long agreed in principle to join SIA, an SIA-CAS Director and an SIA-CAS Recruiter asked Long to provide documents from his work at UTRC and examples of projects on which he had worked to substantiate the claims Long made in his application, and interview with SIA. Long agreed.\n\nOn Dec. 24, 2013, Long emailed several documents to the SIA-CAS Director, including a document that contained the cover page of an export controlled UTRC presentation on Distortion Modeling dated Sept. 30, 2011.\n\nWhile negotiating with SIA, Long also continued to explore other opportunities at other state-run institutions in China. In one email, Long stated: \u201cI have made my mind to return to China, so have prepared a research plan based on my industry experience and current projects.\u201d In the research plan, Long stated: \u201cIn the past five years, I have been working with Pratt Whitney, also other UTC business units, like UTAS (including Hamilton Sundstrand and Goodrich), Sikorsky, CCS (including Carrier and Fire & Security), and Otis. These unique working experiences have provided me a great starting point to perform R&D and further spin off business in China. I believe my efforts will help China to mature its own aircraft engines.\u201d\n\nOn May 30, 2014, Long left UTRC. In June 2014, Long traveled to China and began working for SIA. Beginning in July 2014, digital evidence and forensic analysis indicated that Long brought with him and accessed in China a UTRC external hard drive that had been issued to him and that he unlawfully retained.\n\nIn July 2014, Long was listed as the project leader on a lengthy research plan for CAS involving fourteen other individuals. The plan was replete with references to how the proposed research and development would benefit China. The plan stated: \u201cThe three major engine companies in the world, i.e. GE, Pratt & Whitney in the US and Rolls-Royce in the UK, are all using this technology. . . Our nation lacks the ability to process high performance components, such as airplane wings, tail hooks on carrier aircrafts, and blisks . . . Because of the technology embargo imposed by western developed countries, it is very difficult for us to obtain more advanced design and manufacturing technology . . . This research project will increase our independent ability, efficient and quality in key component manufacturing.\u201d\n\nOn or about Aug. 12, 2014, the document on Distortion Modeling \u2013 the same document from which Long had sent the cover page to the SIA-CAS Director on Dec. 24, 2013 \u2013 was accessed on the external hard drive. Travel records and forensic analysis confirmed that both Long and the external hard drive were in China when this file was accessed.\n\nOn Aug. 19, 2014, Long returned to the U.S. from China through John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. During a secondary inspection screening by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers, Long was found in the possession of a largely completed application for work with a state-controlled aviation and aerospace research center in China. The application highlighted certain parts of Long\u2019s work related to the F119 and F135 engines while at UTRC.\n\nOn or about Aug. 20, 2014, Long emailed an individual at a university in China, attaching an updated \u201cachievement and future plan.\u201d In the plan, Long discussed his work related to the F119 and F135 U.S. military fighter jet engines and stated that he also had knowledge of unpublished UTRC projects in which the U.S. Air Force had shown interest.\n\nOn Nov. 5, 2014, Long boarded a flight from Ithaca, New York to Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey, with a final destination of China. During Long\u2019s layover in Newark, CBP officers inspected Long\u2019s checked baggage and discovered that it contained sensitive, proprietary and export controlled documents from another defense contractor, Rolls Royce.\n\nFurther investigation determined that the U.S. Air Force had convened a consortium of major defense contractors, including Pratt and Rolls Royce, to work together to see whether they could collectively lower the costs of certain metals used. As part of those efforts, members of the consortium shared technical data, subject to restrictions on further dissemination. Rolls Royce reviewed the documents found in Long\u2019s possession at Newark Liberty Airport and confirmed that it provided the documents to members of the consortium, which included Pratt. Rolls Royce further confirmed that Long was never an employee of Rolls Royce. A review of UTRC computer records indicated that Long had printed the documents while employed at UTRC.\n\nLong was arrested on a federal criminal complaint on Nov. 7, 2014. A review of Long\u2019s digital media seized at the time of his arrest revealed voluminous files protected by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations and Export Administration Regulations, and voluminous files proprietary to various U.S. companies. In short, the investigation revealed that Long took his laptop and the UTRC external hard drive with him to China in 2014, at which time there was a substantial body of highly sensitive, proprietary and export controlled materials present on that digital media. UTRC has confirmed that the hard drive that Long unlawfully retained and accessed in China contained not only documents and data from projects on which Long worked while employed at the company but also from projects on which he did not work to which he would have had access.\n\nA sentencing date has not been set. Long has been detained since his arrest.\n\nThis investigation is being led by the FBI in New Haven in coordination with Homeland Security Investigations in New Haven and Newark; the Defense Criminal Investigative Service in New Haven; the U.S. Air Force\u2019s Office of Special Investigations in Boston, Massachusetts; and, the Department of Commerce\u2019s Boston Office of Export Enforcement. U.S. Attorney Daly and Acting Assistant Attorney General McCord also thanked the FBI in Newark, Ithaca and Syracuse, New York, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Service in New York and Newark, and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices for the Northern District of New York and the District of New Jersey, for their efforts and assistance in this matter.This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Tracy Lee Dayton and Stephen B. Reynolds of the District of Connecticut, and Trial Attorneys Brian Fleming and Julie Edelstein of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.",

            "article_text": "CLARKSBURG \u2013 Dr. James Patrick Lewis, of Fairview, West Virginia, has admitted to a fraud charge involving West Virginia University, the Department of Justice announced.\n\nLewis, age 54, pleaded guilty to a one-count information charging him with \u201cFederal Program Fraud.\u201d From 2006 to August 2019, Lewis was a tenured professor at West Virginia University in the physics department, specializing in molecular reactions used in coal conversion technologies. In July 2017, Lewis entered into a contract of employment with the People\u2019s Republic of China through its \u201cGlobal Experts 1000 Talents Plan.\u201d China\u2019s Thousand Talents Plan is one of the most prominent Chinese Talent recruit plans that are designed to attract, recruit, and cultivate high-level scientific talent in furtherance of China\u2019s scientific development, economic prosperity and national security. These talent programs seek to lure overseas talent and foreign experts to bring their knowledge and experience to China and reward individuals for stealing proprietary information.\n\n\u201cLewis defrauded a public university into giving him leave, so that he could satisfy his competing obligations to a Chinese institution, which he hid from the school,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers. \u00a0\u201cI applaud the increased focus of the academic community to detect conflicts of interest and conflicts of commitment. \u00a0Only with more transparency will we stem the tide of covert ties to Chinese institutions and programs, ties meant by the Chinese government to result in the transfer of intellectual property from the United States. \u201d\n\n\u201cThis case represents an attempt to serve China to the detriment of West Virginia University and the United States. Academia is a prime target for these activities and we will remain committed to prosecuting such fraud wherever it is found. I want to thank the FBI, the IRS and our prosecution team for a job well done,\u201d said U.S Attorney Bill Powell, Northern District of West Virginia.\n\n\u201cThe FBI knows the Chinese government intentionally targets the advanced technologies and technical expertise developed in the U.S. to give themselves a competitive advantage in the world marketplace,\u201d said FBI Pittsburgh Special Agent in Charge Robert Jones. \u201cParticipation in a talent plan like the one Dr. Lewis was part of it is not illegal. But FBI investigations have revealed participants are often incentivized to transfer proprietary information or research conducted in the U.S. to China. This remains a significant threat and a high priority threat for the FBI. We are dedicated to making sure foreign governments know U.S. trade secrets cannot and will not be bought.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lewis\u2019s contract, the Chinese Academy of Sciences agreed to employ Lewis as a professor for at least three years. In return, Lewis agreed to maintain an active research program that yielded publications in high quality, peer-reviewed journals, and to provide research training and experience for Chinese Academy of Sciences students.\n\nAs a part of the program, Lewis was promised benefits, including a living subsidy of 1 million Yuan (approximately $143,000), a research subsidy of 4 million Yuan (approximately $573,000), and a salary of 600,000 Yuan (approximately $86,000). To receive the benefits, Lewis would have to work full time in China for three consecutive years, for no less than nine months per year, and would have to begin work no later than Aug. 8, 2018.\n\nIn March 2018, Lewis submitted a request to WVU for an alternate/parental work assignment, requesting to be released from his teaching duties for the fall 2018 semester in order to serve as the primary caregiver for a child he and his wife were expecting in June 2018. In fact, however, Lewis knew this request was fraudulent. Rather than caring for his newborn child, Lewis planned to work in China during the fall 2018 semester as a part of his agreement with the \u201c1000 Talents Plan.\u201d Based on the false justification Lewis offered, WVU granted his request.\n\nIn the fall of 2018, Lewis spent all but three weeks of the semester in China while his newborn child remained in the United States. During this period, Lewis received his full salary from WVU pursuant to his alternate/parental work assignment. Lewis\u2019s scheme allowed him to fraudulently obtain $20,189 from WVU.\n\nAs a part of the plea agreement, Lewis has agreed to pay restitution in the amount of $20,189 in full to WVU. \u00a0Lewis is no longer employed by WVU, having resigned in August 2019.\n\nLewis faces up to 10 years incarceration and a fine of up to $250,000. Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, the actual sentence imposed will be based upon the seriousness of the offenses and the prior criminal history, if any, of the defendant.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Jarod J. Douglas and Trial Attorney Evan N. Turgeon with the Department of Justice\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section, National Security Division, are prosecuting the case on behalf of the government. The FBI and the Internal Revenue Service investigated. WVU cooperated in the investigation of this case.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Michael John Aloi presided.",

            "article_text": "Remarks as Prepared for Delivery\n\nThank you, to the Cybersecurity Coalition and the Cyber Threat Alliance, for the invitation to speak at CyberNext DC.\n\nWhen I was preparing my remarks, I noticed that the theme of the conference is \u201cPrivacy, Partnerships, Protection.\u201d That\u2019s a helpful framework for my remarks today, because I want to talk about all three of those.\n\nProtection\n\nI will start with protection, which is at the core of law enforcement\u2019s mission. Investigating crimes, building cases, and holding individuals, entities, and even nations, accountable, is a large part of how the Justice Department protects the public and contributes to cybersecurity.\n\nIt is fairly straightforward why: criminal prosecution is a means of reinforcing the difference between right and wrong, between acceptable state behavior, on the one hand, and that which violates accepted norms of conduct on the Internet.\n\nAnd imposing consequences, whether through imprisonment, fines or sanctions, or other tools, is a way of deterring malicious conduct, by raising its costs (personal, reputational, financial, and otherwise). As the First Pillar of the Administration\u2019s recent National Cyber Strategy puts it, \u201cLaw enforcement actions to combat criminal cyber activity serve as an instrument of national power by, among other things, deterring those activities.\u201d\n\nThe last year has seen significant prosecutions of foreign hackers, including those acting on behalf of foreign governments, for computer intrusions and attacks. It is worth recounting some of them, for what they show about the Department\u2019s priorities and the lengths we will go in doing our part to enforce the law and protect the public.\n\nBoyusec\n\nIn October 2017, the Department announced charges against three Chinese nationals and residents who worked for a purported Internet security firm known as Guangzhou Bo Yu Information Technology Company Limited (a/k/a \u201cBoyusec\u201d).\n\nThe defendants are accused of computer hacking and trade secret theft between December 2015 and March 2016. Among other things, the indictment alleges they stole a prominent economist\u2019s e-mail messages and trade secrets related to global navigation technology that \u201chad no military application,\u201d but was marketed to construction, land survey, and agricultural sectors.\n\nNow, the Indictment does not allege action by the Chinese state. But what made the defendants\u2019 alleged trade secret theft notable (besides the fact that they worked for a firm that marketed its cybersecurity services), was that it continued after China committed in September 2015 (1) not to steal trade secrets or confidential business information \u201cwith the intent of providing competitive advantages\u201d to its own companies, and (2) to cooperate with requests to investigate cybercrimes emanating from its territory, which this did.\n\nThe September 2015 commitment ushered in broad, public acceptance of a norm against computer espionage for economic benefit (soon accepted by all of the other members of the G-20). And it was incumbent on the U.S. government to hold China to the commitments it made.\n\nAs we previously revealed, the Boyusec indictment was returned under seal, while we sought China\u2019s assistance in investigating and putting a stop to Boyusec\u2019s activities.\u00a0 When we received \u201cno meaningful response\u201d to those requests, there was no longer a basis to keep the charges sealed, and we made them public.\n\nThereafter, the U.S. Trade Representative cited the Boyusec indictment in its March 2018 study of China\u2019s trade practices under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which concluded that a combination of China\u2019s practices are unreasonable, including its outbound investment policies and sponsorship of unauthorized computer intrusions.\n\nIn this way, you can draw a direct line from the DOJ\u2019s indictment of China\u2019s military officers in 2014, through China\u2019s commitments in 2015, to our monitoring for compliance with those commitments, and this Administration\u2019s response to China\u2019s economic aggression, which includes state-sponsored theft of intellectual property.\n\nMabna Institute\n\nIn March of 2018, the Department announced charges against nine Iranian nationals associated with the Mabna Institute in Iran for a massive coordinated hacking campaign that targeted intellectual property and other research at more than 300 colleges and universities around the world.\n\nThe very purpose of the Mabna Institute, according to the indictment, was to assist Iranian universities and scientific and research organizations obtain access to scientific resources outside Iran. It contracted with the Iranian government (including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.) as well as private organizations, and it sold some of the stolen data on websites marketed to Iranian customers.\n\nThe indictment alleges the campaign was executed in three phases:\n\n\n\nOver the course of four years, the Mabna Institute and these nine individuals are accused of stealing more than 31 terabytes of academic data, intellectual property, and communications.\u00a0 That amounts to 7.75 trillion sheets of paper. (And that\u2019s printing double-sided.) U.S. universities had collectively spent $3.4 billion to have access to that intellectual property.\n\nThe charges themselves virtually guarantee the defendants cannot leave Iran without arrest. And on the day they were announced, the Department of the Treasury, leveraging our investigation, sanctioned the Mabna Institute and the defendants \u201cfor engaging in malicious cyber-enabled activities related to the significant misappropriation of economic resources or personal identifiers for private financial gain,\u201d under a provision of Executive Order 13694 (2015).\n\nDPRK\n\nIn September, the Department unsealed a massive complaint, outlining some of the government\u2019s proof behind its prior, higher-level attribution that North Korea launched a destructive malware attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014, stole $81 million from the Bank of Bangladesh in 2016 (and attempted to steal at least $1 billion from other banks), and created the malware used in the WannaCry 2.0 global ransomware attack last year.\n\nThe complaint lays out more than 170 pages of evidence that a single conspiracy, backed by the North Korean government, was responsible for those crimes among others, and it identifies one of the men who was a member of that conspiracy.\n\nAs the complaint makes clear, however, the U.S. government was not alone in this investigation.\u00a0 The complaint cites to security researchers whose expertise and dogged pursuit of the threat was critical to the allegations of the complaint. Our investigative efforts not only validate theirs, they yield specific information that expanded the security community\u2019s understanding of the Lazarus Group (a popular name for the intrusion set) and how best to protect against it.\n\nUSADA, et al.\n\nFinally, this brings me to this morning\u2019s announcement of an indictment in Pittsburgh (where the first public national security cyber case was unsealed in 2014).\n\nA grand jury there has indicted seven Russian GRU officers with an international hacking conspiracy targeting international anti-doping organizations, among others.\n\nAmong the conspiracy\u2019s goals: to publicize stolen information as part of an influence and disinformation campaign designed to undermine, retaliate against, and otherwise delegitimize those organizations, which had publicly exposed Russia\u2019s state-sponsored athlete doping program; and to damage the reputations of athletes around the world by falsely claiming that such athletes were using banned or performance-enhancing drugs.\n\nThe indictment also alleges how, when the efforts to obtain remote access failed to achieve their objectives, the GRU sent several of the defendants to locations where their targets were physically located. Then, using specialized equipment, those close access teams hacked the WiFi networks used by the victim organizations or their personnel (like hotel networks where they were staying).\n\nThere are some who question this approach, of criminally investigating and charging hackers sponsored by foreign states, often because we have not yet arrested the defendants I have described above.\n\nIt is probably easy to forget that, until relatively recently, such charges were unheard of, because for a long time, we viewed the problem of foreign state-sponsored hacking through the lens of intelligence collection alone, without regard to disruption and deterrence (which are our objectives in confronting terrorism, espionage, and other challenging national security threats).\n\nBut imagine a world in which there arenocriminal charges, no detailed, formal allegation of wrongdoing (which the government is prepared to stand behind in court). The private sector would be left alone to accuse the guilty, without recourse.\u00a0 What message doesthatsend to a foreign hacker?\n\nCertainly not the same message we have sent to Karim Baratov, the 23-year-old hacker who worked with FSB officers to hack into e-mail accounts around the world, who was recently sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment after being arrested in Canada and waiving extradition.\u00a0 Or to Ardit Firizi, the Kosovar who was arrested in Malaysia, pled guilty here, and was sentenced to 20 years in prison, for giving ISIS PII for 1,300 military and government personnel, which he stole from the network of a U.S. retailer. Or to countless other hackers arrested on purely criminal charges, who thought they were safe from the consequences for their actions, because they operated under regimes that ignored (if not sponsored) their crimes.\n\nAnd even in the cases above (where we have yet to apprehend a defendant), the charges were never the end of the story: whether it is trade remedies, sanctions, contributions to network defense, or diplomatic efforts to rally likeminded nations to confront an adversary together, all of those charges served a greater purpose.\n\nPrivacy\n\nSo often, privacy is spoken about as if it is a value opposed to law enforcement. But each of the cases I described vindicates the right to privacy, whether it is the right of a company to control who has access to its trade secrets, or of professors to prevent their hard-earned research from being stolen, preempted, and plagiarized; the expectation of privacy we have in our e-mail communications or our medical records.\n\nPrivacy isn\u2019t dead, but it is under attack, and much of what we are doing through law enforcement honors the privacy of innocent persons, by investigating those who would breach it. As the Sony case as well as the GRU cases illustrate, data breaches are not just trees that fall in forests when no one else is around; their consequences are often painfully visible to their victims (and the rest of the world).\n\nBut leaving aside these examples of DOXing, I want to shift gears for a moment, to talk about the Department of Justice\u2019s changing approach to personal privacy, and why the privacy of your personal information can be a matter of national security.\n\nThis portion of my remarks comes from a different vantage point, from my experience with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (or CFIUS), where I represent the Department.\n\nNow CFIUS, for those of you who are not familiar, is a committee of federal departments that reviews foreign acquisitions of U.S. businesses for national security risk. When it finds risks that cannot be mitigated, it recommends actions to the President, who has the authority to prohibit a transaction.\n\nCFIUS does not review the vast majority of foreign investments in the United States. Even among those transactions we do review, we usually conclude that there are no unresolved national security concern.\n\nA classic example of the risk CFIUS examines arises when the target of an acquisition is in close proximity to a DOD facility. But an increasing focus of DOJ\u2019s work on the committee relates to data security, to the potential national security consequences of personal information ending up in the wrong hands. The kind of information I am talking about is collected every day, from thousands or even millions of consumers. Transaction information, PII, health information, even smartphone habits.\n\nNow you might ask why the security of that kind of consumer data would be relevant to CFIUS, whose mission is to protect national security. And ten years ago, or so, such information did not seem like it would be. But a few things have changed.\n\nFirst, the volume and variety of data has increased exponentially. Information that was not previously stored in a digital form now is. And the rate at which data are being created, the velocity of data growth, is increasing.\n\nConsider the increasing connectedness of physical devices and sensors, often referred to as the Internet of Things. Everything from medical devices, such as pacemakers, to fitness trackers, to the control systems that deliver water and power to our businesses and homes. One estimate predicts the number of Internet-connected devices will reach more than 20 billion by 2020.\u00a0 These Internet-connected devices have increased the volume, variety, and velocity of information.\n\nTake cars, for example. Not long ago, a car was essentially a mechanical device, an engine with seats that moved you from point A to point B. Whatever limited electronic components it had were self-contained.\n\nToday\u2019s cars, by contrast, contain communication devices, sensors, GPS navigation, and other computers with a variety of functions. They allow drivers to check fuel levels and tire pressure on their cell phones, track a stolen vehicle over the Internet, call for help from the car in an emergency, and access the same entertainment they\u2019re used to enjoying in their home.\n\nAnother example: the universe of health information is rapidly expanding.\u00a0 More people are taking advantage of DNA testing to learn about their health, longevity, paternity, and ancestry.\u00a0 According to one 2017 report, the market for testing has become an $830 million industry. Meanwhile, our smartphones and watches are accruing ever more precise information about our health and habits.\n\nNew forms and pools of data merely add to what has been collected for years, and it remains possible for a determined adversary to steal it, given enough time and resources.\n\nA second insight we have developed is that information that seems unimportant, or purely personal, or irrelevant, can, in fact, be used to threaten national security.\n\nIn January, a 20-year-old Australian student discovered that open source maps of where Fitbit and other fitness device users frequently go could be used to identify military facilities in remote areas.\u00a0 As the Washington Post put it, \u201cIn war zones and deserts in countries such as Iraq and Syria, the heat map becomes almost entirely dark \u2014 except for scattered pinpricks of activity. Zooming in on those areas brings into focus the locations and outlines of known U.S. military bases, as well as other unknown and potentially sensitive sites \u2014 presumably because American soldiers and other personnel are using fitness trackers as they move around.\u201d\n\nSome data might be valuable, in and of themselves, like a military secret or the admin password to an industrial control system. But other data are valuable because they are part of what a hacker or other malicious actor needs to achieve their objective, to get to their target.\n\nThe information a modern car collects provides insight into the users\u2019 network of contacts, entertainment preferences, driving habits, and locations visited on a regular basis.\n\nIn the aggregate, this information provides commercial and cultural insights that might have monetary or other use. But this information about the \u201cpattern of life\u201d of a company\u2019s CEO or government official could also be used to target that individual.\n\nBy themselves, the music you favor, your children\u2019s birthdates, your anniversary, and the addresses you\u2019ve lived at\u2014these are not national security secrets.\n\nBut with that information, a criminal hacker could answer password reset questions or use a password cracker to obtain control of your accounts. And even if it is a personal (as opposed to a professional) account, and I might not care about the last photoyouposted from your vacation, masquerading as you online makes it that much easier to trick the people who know you into clicking on a link or otherwise compromising their network security.\n\nOur third insight is this: the fact that most people in a data set might not be targets themselves (in fact, that only a few might be) provides little comfort. Anyone on any form of social media has learned that we are more connected than it seems. In 2016, Facebook reported that its American users were separated by fewer than 3.5 degrees of separation on average. Extrapolating what that means offline, anyone\u2019s information can be useful more for what it tells us about her brother, the CISO at a major bank, or her aunt in the intelligence community.\n\nOur concerns are exacerbated by the fact that traditional methods of de-identification of data (such as anonymization or encryption of content) may be defeated, by, for example, sensor and geolocation data, or by cross-referencing sanitized data sets against others.\n\nResearchers from two studies several years ago reported that, with a sufficient pool of data, they could distinguish a unique user of a cellphone, or a credit card, based on just four geolocations or transactions, respectively, with at least 90 percent accuracy. I cannot vouch for the methodology of those studies, but they give me pause when I think about the potential that nefarious actors could have access to large pools of such data without legal process.\n\nWhat does this mean for companies, and the way they should think about their data?\n\nFirst, and most important, they should not assume that hackers are not interested in the data or that it cannot be used to threaten national security.\n\nSecond, cybersecurity policies and practices need to keep pace as businesses grow and deploy new technologies, such as biometric identification or artificial intelligence.\n\nThird, joint ventures or other arrangements with foreign parties may provide network access or other elements of control over data. Businesses should consider the ways an aggressive foreign intelligence service could exploit that data,in light of other data it might have from other sources.\n\nFourth, and finally, report computer intrusions, because the breach you think is merely a private matter, may in fact be a matter of national security.\n\nPartnerships\n\nThis brings me to the final theme, partnerships. The cases we bring require true partnerships, between law enforcement and the victims who cooperate with us; between us and the intelligence community and other components of the government; and, increasingly, between our government and the governments of likeminded nations, whether in gathering and sharing information, validating our conclusions, extraditing defendants, or imposing other consequences.\n\nBut as much as I believe in the value of criminal prosecutions, we have always known that we will not prosecute our way to cybersecurity. The partnership that may be most critical to our future is among the professionals in and out of government who share common goals. Which is why one of the National Security Division\u2019s greatest successes this year did not result in a criminal charge.\n\nIn May, agents of the FBI were tracking a virulent botnet infecting home and office routers around the world, attributed to the same group responsible for today\u2019s indictment, known to some as \u201cFancy Bear.\u201d\n\nThe botnet was growing at an alarming rate by that point, and private sector researchers studying it told us they felt an increasing urgency to publish what they knew, so that affected router manufacturers, ISPs, and others could take steps to protect the public before it was too late.\n\nThere was no easy technical solution to this pernicious malware. Its second stage (which could steal information and even brick the device) could be cleared from memory with a simple restart, but if a router were infected, complete mitigation could be virtually impossible, short of replacement, because the first stage of malware (the actors\u2019 toe-hold in the system) would just call out for instructions to reinfect.\n\nWith no time to waste, in little more than a week (including late nights and a weekend), agents and prosecutors devised the best mitigation plan they could under the circumstances.\n\nIn a coordinated action,\n\nResearchers drew attention to the botnet at the same time that the FBI executed the orders and blasted out a public service advisory to restart your router, purging the second stage of malware and causing the first stage to call out for instructions, now to the FBI\u2019s server, so that help could be alerted. These efforts were our best effort to identify and remediate the infection worldwide in the time available, before Fancy Bear actors learned of the vulnerabilities in the C2 infrastructure through the research firm\u2019s imminent announcement.\n\nLast week, Cisco Talos, the research firm I mentioned, published a follow-up to its original report. It found that the VPNFilter malware possessed even greater capabilities than previously identified, in the form of third-stage malware modules that provide additional capabilities to map networks, exploit systems connected to infected devices, and obfuscate or encrypt malicious traffic.\n\nBut Cisco Talos also reported, based on information from partners as well as its own analysis, that \u201cit appears that VPNFilter has been entirely neutralized since\u201d the effort I described earlier by a coalition of international partners (which included the Cyber Threat Alliance). So far, they said, there have been no signs of the actors attempting to reconnect with the devices that remain infected with the pernicious first stage of the malware. Not bad, for the first (but I promise you, not the last) effort to mitigate a botnet tied to nation-state actors.\n\nOnce, there was no one. Attribution was whispered in classified channels alone. We spoke, haltingly at first, of cyber threats \u201cemanating from Asia.\u201d Then the U.S. led the way, calling out the malicious behavior of specific foreign states, first in speeches, then by indictment.\n\nToday, we are joined by three other nations in attributing specific conduct to Russia.\n\nI cannot tell you where our commitment to partnership will take us next. But I can tell you, based on this, that there is reason for hope, and to continue working together to maintain an \u201copen, interoperable, reliable, and secure Internet.\u201d",

            "article_text": "PHILADELPHIA, PA \u2013 United States Attorney William M. McSwain announced affirmative civil enforcement (ACE) achievements in 2019 by the Civil Division of the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and its ongoing efforts in the first half of 2020 to stop fraud, waste, and abuse against the government. The number of affirmative civil enforcement settlements rose to an all-time high in 2019, solidifying the Office\u2019s Civil Division as one of the busiest and most productive in the nation.\n\nThe Office\u2019s Civil Division recovered over $260 million in settlements and judgments from civil cases involving fraud against the government in 2019 and the first half of 2020.\u00a0 These matters originated fromqui tam, or whistleblower, filings under the False Claims Act (FCA), referrals from agency partnerships, and proactive efforts including data analytics. In 2019, the Civil Division also opened a record-setting number of ACE investigations into alleged fraud against the government, Controlled Substances Act violations, and civil rights violations. Much of the Office\u2019s affirmative success came from a renewed focus on generating and supporting investigations using data analytics, which helps to identify fraud trends.\n\n\u201cThis past year\u2019s results reflect creative and groundbreaking resolutions across a variety of programs that appropriately address violations by health care providers, government contractors, and federal grant recipients, while encouraging those same entities and their employees to come forward and self-disclose when they are aware of non-compliance with federal laws,\u201d said U.S. Attorney McSwain. \u201cIn our District, we have one of the most sophisticated whistleblower bars in the country. We thank those whistleblowers and their counsel who have brought allegations of fraud to our attention. The willingness of whistleblowers, or relators, to come forward and shed light on claims of fraud resulted in the return of millions of dollars to the federal government programs that were defrauded.\u201d\n\nU.S. Attorney McSwain continued, \u201cWe also thank our federal enforcement partners for their dedication in the matters summarized below, including: the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Inspector General; the Defense Investigative Service, Office of the Inspector General; the Department of Veterans Affairs; the Drug Enforcement Administration; the United States Office of Personnel Management, Office of the Inspector General; and the United States Postal Inspection Service. My Office would not have achieved the level of success it did without the benefit of their dedication and expertise.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur Civil Division\u2019s affirmative achievements show that we will fight fraud and hold companies and individuals accountable, no matter the methods, schemes, or amounts at play,\u201d U.S. Attorney McSwain said. \u201cI look forward to ongoing ACE success and continued enforcement in the areas of health care fraud, grant fraud, Controlled Substances Act enforcement, and civil rights enforcement.\u201d\n\nBelow are some of the case highlights from 2019 and thus far in 2020.\n\n2019 ACE Achievements Spanned Multiple Enforcement Areas\n\nFCA Healthcare Fraud Settlements\n\nPentec Health.Pentec Health, a provider of compounded infusion drugs and nutritional supplements for use by patients with end-stage renal disease, paid $17 million to resolve allegations that, from 2007 to 2018, it billed Medicare and other federal healthcare programs for excessive amounts of product wasted during the compounding of its nutritional supplement Proplete for dialysis patients, and routinely waived patient copayments and deductible obligations in order to induce prescriptions and use of Proplete. Along with this settlement, Pentec executed a Corporate Integrity Agreement with the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General.https://www.justice.gov/usao-edpa/pr/pentec-health-inc-pay-17-million-settle-false-claims-act-allegations\n\nMallinckrodt/Questcor Pharmaceuticals.\u00a0 Mallinckrodt ARD LLC (formerly known as Mallinckrodt ARD, Inc. and previously Questcor Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) paid $15.4 million to resolve claims that Questcor paid illegal kickbacks to doctors from 2009 through 2013 in the form of lavish dinners and entertainment, to induce prescriptions of the company\u2019s drug, H.P. Acthar Gel, for the treatment of complications from multiple sclerosis. The company allegedly paid kickbacks to induce referrals from health care providers in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute and to induce the submission of false claims to Medicare.https://www.justice.gov/usao-edpa/pr/drug-maker-mallinckrodt-agrees-pay-154-million-resolve-false-claims-act-allegations\n\nHeritage Pharmaceuticals.Generic drug manufacturer Heritage Pharmaceuticals paid $7.1 million to resolve allegations that from 2012 to 2015, it engaged in a scheme to artificially inflate generic drug prices and other anti-competitive behavior, causing a loss to Medicare, Medicaid, and the Department of Defense\u2019s Tricare program beneficiaries, as well as the Department of Veterans Affairs. Separately, Heritage entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement with the Antitrust Division with regard to a criminal charge that the company conspired to suppress and eliminate competition by allocating customers, rigging bids, and fixing and maintaining prices in violation of the Sherman Act.https://www.justice.gov/usao-edpa/pr/heritage-pharmaceuticals-pays-over-7-million-resolve-civil-false-claims-act-allegations\n\nControlled Substances Act Enforcement\n\nSpiro Kassis, M.D.Dr. Kassis paid $1.4 million, committed to never obtaining a controlled substance registration, and consented to a 15-year exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid to resolve allegations that he improperly prescribed Schedule II controlled substances to patients between 2014 and 2017.\n\nIn a parallel criminal proceeding, Kassis pled guilty to 14 counts of illegal distribution of controlled substances. According to the criminal charges, Kassis, who claimed to be a specialist in psychiatry and addiction medicine, operated medical offices in East Norriton Township, PA and Scranton, PA and used his offices to operate a prescription \u201cpill mill\u201d where he sold medically unnecessary prescriptions for opioids such as oxycodone for approximately $200 cash each.\n\nThis opioid settlement, the first of its kind in this Office, simultaneously resolved all three aspects of liability \u2013 under the Controlled Substances Act, FCA, and forfeiture statutes \u2013 in a single civil settlement agreement.https://www.justice.gov/usao-edpa/pr/montgomery-county-doctor-agrees-pay-14-million-resolve-allegations-improper-opioid\n\nFCA Procurement and Grant Fraud Settlements\n\nDrexel University. Drexel agreed to pay the United States $189,062 to resolve potential FCA liability for a former professor\u2019s use of grant funds to fund trips to \u201cgentlemen\u2019s clubs,\u201d sports bars, and other improper purchases. The government\u2019s investigation began in 2017 after Drexel voluntarily disclosed the improper charges to eight federal grants for energy and naval technology related research that it received from the Department of the Navy, the Department of Energy, and the National Science Foundation.https://www.justice.gov/usao-edpa/pr/drexel-university-pay-189062-resolve-potential-false-claims-liability\n\nAmbu.Ambu, a provider of medical supplies, paid $3.3 million to resolve allegations that it submitted false claims for manufactured products in China and Malaysia for sale to United States government agencies in violation of the Trade Agreements Act (\u201cTAA\u201d). The TAA requires that products sold to government agencies must come only from countries with which the United States has a trade agreement.https://www.justice.gov/usao-edpa/pr/defense-contractor-pay-33m-resolve-false-claims-act-allegations\n\nOur Lady of Lourdes.Our Lady of Lourdes Health Foundation and two related Our Lady of Lourdes companies paid $1,143,881 to resolve claims arising from Lourdes\u2019 administration of community service grants funded through the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS)\u2019s Senior Corps program. Specifically, the fraud affected the Foster Grandparent Program, which places seniors in school and community settings to serve alongside youth with exceptional needs, and the Senior Companion Program, which places seniors in community and residential settings to assist other seniors who have difficulty with tasks of daily living. These programs provide small hourly stipends to the volunteers performing these services, who must clear criminal history checks to ensure their suitability for service. Lourdes allegedly either failed to perform these criminal history checks or failed to keep records of doing so for 46 individuals. When a monitoring visit was scheduled in 2017, Lourdes employees cut-and-pasted other background checks in an attempt to conceal this failure from CNCS officials.https://www.justice.gov/usao-edpa/pr/our-lady-lourdes-agrees-pay-over-11m-resolve-claims-it-failed-perform-background-checks\n\nCivil Rights Settlements\n\nThomas Jefferson University Hospital.\u00a0 Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals, Inc., and Outpatient Imaging Affiliates, LLC, the owners and operators of Jefferson Outpatient Imaging and Radiology (\u201cJefferson Outpatient\u201d), resolved allegations that Jefferson Outpatient violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by denying full and equal access to services based on an individual\u2019s disability and use of a wheelchair. Under the ADA, facilities like Jefferson Outpatient, as a place of public accommodation, must provide outpatient and radiology services to members of the general public. In response to allegations that it failed to provide access to DEXA bone density scans to individuals with disabilities at its facilities in the greater Philadelphia area, Jefferson Outpatient agreed to comply with its obligations under the ADA, provide employee training, pay compensatory damages to the complainant, adopt and incorporate a non-discrimination policy into its existing policies, and post the policy in conspicuous locations in all of its offices and on its website.https://www.justice.gov/usao-edpa/pr/eastern-district-pennsylvania-reaches-settlement-agreement-thomas-jefferson-university\n\nACE Achievements Continue in 2020, Despite Coronavirus Pandemic\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has not impeded the Office\u2019s continued work in the civil enforcement area, as resolutions of significant FCA matters have continued into 2020:\n\nIn February 2020,Guardian Elder Care Holdings, Inc., and its related companies, paid over $15 million to settle claims that the skilled nursing home chain provided medically unnecessary rehabilitation therapy to residents in order to meet revenue goals. Guardian Elder Care operates more than fifty facilities throughout Pennsylvania \u2013 including locations in the Lehigh Valley, the Poconos, and Bucks County \u2013 as well as in Ohio and West Virginia.https://www.justice.gov/usao-edpa/pr/pennsylvania-nursing-home-chain-pay-155-million-settle-false-claims-act-allegations\n\nIn April 2020,Logan Laboratories, Inc.and two former executives, Michael T. Doyle and Christopher Utz Toepke, agreed to pay $41 million to resolve alleged FCA violations for billing federal health care programs for medically unnecessary urine drug testing.https://www.justice.gov/usao-edpa/pr/florida-based-laboratory-pain-clinic-and-two-former-executives-agree-pay-41-million\n\nIn July 2020,Universal Health Services, Inc. and UHS of Delaware, Inc. (UHS), headquartered in King of Prussia, PA, agreed to pay $117 million to resolve alleged FCA violations for billing for medically unnecessary inpatient behavioral health services and for failing to provide adequate and appropriate services for adults and children admitted to UHS psychiatric and behavioral treatment facilities nationwide.https://www.justice.gov/usao-edpa/pr/universal-health-services-inc-pay-117-million-settle-false-claims-act-allegations\n\nAs the year continues to unfold, the Office\u2019s Civil Division is prepared to fight any coronavirus-related fraud through the enforcement of the FCA. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act provided $2 trillion in federal funds to fight the ongoing health and economic crisis caused by the coronavirus and was the largest economic stimulus package in U.S. history. It provided $349 billion in loans for small businesses, $130 billion in relief for hospitals and medical suppliers, and $500 billion in assistance to other businesses, states, and municipalities. Unfortunately, there are unscrupulous actors who are attempting to take advantage of these financial outlays by committing fraud, especially when there is so much money at stake.\n\nAttorney General Barr has directed the Department of Justice to prioritize fraud schemes arising out of the coronavirus pandemic. If there are federal funds involved in any coronavirus-related fraud in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, whether through Medicare, Medicaid, defense contracting, or other government contracts, this Office will dedicate resources to holding companies and individuals appropriately accountable. The FCA remains an extremely powerful tool to combat fraud on the government.\n\n\u201cDuring this difficult time, protecting our communities from fraudsters who prey on federal programs and federal taxpayers is paramount,\u201d said U.S. Attorney McSwain. \u201cPrevious experience has shown that there are people who will seek to illegally profit from disasters. But my Office is committed to using all of the criminal and civil tools at our disposal to protect federal programs.\u201d",

            "article_text": "FRESNO, Calif. \u2014 A federal grand jury returned a three-count indictment today against Jia Bei Zhu, aka Jesse Zhu, Qiang He, and David He, 62, a citizen of China who formerly resided in Clovis, charging him with distributing adulterated and misbranded medical devices in violation of the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and for making false statements to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), U.S. Attorney Phillip A. Talbert announced.\n\nAccording to court documents, between January 2020 and March 2023, through the companies Universal Meditech Incorporated (UMI) and Prestige Biotech Incorporated (PBI), Zhu sold hundreds of thousands of COVID-19 test kits to companies throughout the United States. UMI and PBI were based in Fresno and Reedley and did not obtain pre-market approval, pre-market clearance, emergency use authorization, or other applicable exemption from the FDA as was required. UMI and PBI received millions of dollars for the sales of the test kits.\n\nWhen questioned by FDA officials, Zhu made several false statements to them, including that (1) his name was Qiang \u201cDavid\u201d He, (2) he was hired by UMI as a COVID-19 consultant in 2021, (3) he was hired by PBI just a couple of weeks prior to meeting with the FDA to communicate with government agencies on PBI\u2019s behalf, and (4) he did not know anything about the manufacturing or distribution histories for UMI or PBI.\n\nThis case is the product of an investigation by the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations with assistance from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the California Department of Public Health \u2013 Food and Drug Branch. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Joseph D. Barton, Arelis M. Clemente, and Henry Z. Carbajal III are prosecuting this case.\n\nIf convicted, Zhu faces a maximum statutory penalty of three years in prison and a $250,000 fine for the adulterated and misbranding of medical devices charges, and five years in prison and a $250,000 fine for the false statements charge. Any sentence, however, would be determined at the discretion of the court after consideration of any applicable statutory factors and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which take into account a number of variables. The charges are only allegations; the defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.",

Mizer, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division; Deputy Commissioner for Global Regulatory Operations and Policy Howard Sklamberg J.D. of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); Acting Deputy Director J. Reilly Dolan of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection; Acting Deputy Chief Inspector Gary Barksdale of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS); and Chief Richard Weber of the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s (IRS) Criminal Investigation (CI) Division. \u00a0The Department of Defense (DoD) and the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) are also participating in the sweep to unveil new tools to increase awareness of the risks unlawful dietary supplements pose to consumers and, in particular, to assist service members targeted by illegitimate athletic performance supplements.\n\n\u201cThe Justice Department and its federal partners have joined forces to bringing to justice companies and individuals who profit from products that threaten consumer health,\u201d said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Mizer.\u00a0 \u201cThe USPlabs case and others brought as part of this sweep illustrate alarming practices the department found\u2014practices that must be brought to the public\u2019s attention so consumers know the serious health risks of untested products.\u201d\n\nDuring the period of the sweep, 117 individuals and entities were pursued through criminal and civil enforcement actions.\u00a0 Of these, 89 were the subject of cases filed since November 2014.\n\nCriminal Matters\n\nAn 11-count indictment was unsealed earlier today against USPlabs LLC, a Dallas firm, which formerly manufactured highly popular workout and weight loss supplements.\u00a0 The indictment charges USPlabs, S.K. Laboratories Inc., based in Anaheim, California, and their operators with a variety of charges related to the sale of those products.\u00a0 Jacobo Geissler, 39, of University Park, Texas, the CEO of\u00a0 USPlabs; Jonathan Doyle, 37, of Dallas, the president of\u00a0 USPlabs; Matthew Hebert, 37, of Dallas, responsible for product packaging design at USPlabs; Kenneth Miles, 69, of Panama City, Florida, the quality assurance executive in charge of compliance at USPlabs; S.K. Laboratories Inc.; Sitesh Patel, 32, of Irvine, California, the vice president of\u00a0 S.K. Laboratories; and Cyril Willson, 34, of Gretna, Nebraska, a consultant to USPlabs, are charged with various counts associated with the unlawful sale of dietary supplements.\u00a0 Additionally, USPlabs, Geissler, Doyle and Hebert are charged with obstruction of an FDA proceeding and conspiracy to commit money laundering.\n\nFour of the defendants were arrested earlier today and the other two will self-surrender.\u00a0 Along with the arrests, FDA and IRS-CI special agents seized assets in dozens of investment accounts, real estate in Texas and a number of luxury and sports cars.\n\nThe indictment alleges that USPlabs engaged in a conspiracy to import ingredients from China using false certificates of analysis and false labeling and then lied about the source and nature of those ingredients after it put them in its products.\u00a0 According to the indictment, USPlabs told some of its retailers and wholesalers that it used natural plant extracts in products called Jack3d and OxyElite Pro, when in fact it was using a synthetic stimulant manufactured in a Chinese chemical factory.\n\nThe indictment also alleges that the defendants sold some of their products without determining whether they would be safe to use.\u00a0 In fact, as the indictment notes, the defendants knew of studies that linked the products to liver toxicity.\n\nThe indictment also alleges that in October 2013, USPlabs and its principals told the FDA that it would stop distribution of OxyElite Pro after the product had been implicated in an outbreak of liver injuries.\u00a0 The indictment alleges that, despite this promise, USPlabs engaged in a surreptitious, all-hands-on-deck effort to sell as much OxyElite Pro as it could as quickly as possible.\u00a0 It was sold at dietary supplement stores across the nation.\n\n\u201cThis joint agency effort is a testament to our commitment to protecting consumers from potentially unsafe dietary supplements and products falsely marketed as dietary supplements,\u201d said Deputy Commissioner Sklamberg.\u00a0 \u201cThe criminal charges against USPlabs should serve as notice to industry that if products are a threat to public health, the FDA will exercise its full authority under the law to bring justice.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s criminal charges are among 14 criminal cases prosecuted by the Civil Division\u2019s Consumer Protection Branch and U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices across the country from November 2014 to November 2015.\u00a0 See thischart.\u00a0 Of the 14 criminal cases prosecuted during this timeframe, 11 cases against 29 individuals and entities have been filed since November 2014.\n\nThe charges and allegations in the indictments are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\n\nCivil Cases\n\nThe Department of Justice also filed in the past week five civil cases seeking injunctive relief against a number of businesses and individuals that allegedly sold supplements as disease cures or that were otherwise in violation of the law.\u00a0 These matters, investigated by USPIS and the FDA, include the following:\n\n\u201cPostal Inspectors have a long history of effectively enforcing the mail fraud statute to halt snake oil salesmen and medical quacks from using the mails to purvey their wares upon unsuspecting citizens,\u201d said Acting Deputy Chief Postal Inspector Barksdale.\u00a0 \u201cWe look at these latest\u00a0misrepresentations and frauds as \u2018old wine in a new bottle.\u2019\u00a0 Working with our law enforcement and regulatory partners, we hope to protect American consumers by keeping these scams \u2018bottled up\u2019.\u201d\n\nCivil actions brought by the FTC as part of the sweep to combat unsubstantiated supplement claims include the following:\n\n\u201cPeople looking for a dietary supplement to improve their health have to wade through a swamp of misleading ads,\u201d said Director Jessica Rich of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection.\u00a0 \u201cBe skeptical of ads for supplements that claim to cure diseases, reverse the signs of aging or cause weight loss without diet or exercise.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s cases are among 25 civil actions pursued by the Civil Division\u2019s Consumer Protection Branch, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices and the FTC from November 2014 to November 2015.\u00a0 Of the 25 actions, 22 civil cases against 60 individuals and entities have been filed since November 2014.\u00a0 To date, courts have entered judicial orders in 11 cases, requiring dietary supplement makers to change their business practices to ensure that they are selling their products in compliance with the law.\n\nEducational materials\n\nAs part of today\u2019s sweep, the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences\u2019 Consortium for Health and Military Performance partnered, through its Human Performance Resource Center (HPRC), with the USADA to develop educational resources for service members to protect them from risky dietary supplements.\u00a0 Through this partnership, the organizations will jointly launch an online interactive educational module called \u201cGet the Scoop on Supplements: Realize, Recognize, and Reduce Your Risk.\u201d\u00a0 Also launching today are two mobile applications: the HPRC\u2019s Operation Supplement Safety (OPSS) High-Risk Supplement List mobile application for Service members and USADA\u2019s Supplement 411 mobile application for athletes (both accessible via the Google Play and Apple App stores and available to the general public).\n\nThese educational products will augment the important information available on USADA\u2019sSupplement411.orgwebsite and theOPSS website, including the OPSS High-Risk Supplement List which was launched in February 2015. \u00a0To access more information available to service members, consult the OPSS website and a recently released video athttp://hprc-online.org/blog/decoding-the-dietary-supplement-industry.\u00a0 To access the educational resources USADA provides for athletes and general consumers to help realize, recognize and reduce the risks associated with using supplement products visit USADA\u2019s websitehttp://www.supplement411.org.\n\n\u201cEnsuring readiness of the force is one of the Department of Defense\u2019s top goals,\u201d said Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs Dr. Dave Smith of DoD\u2019s Military Health System.\u00a0 \u201cUnsafe dietary supplements are a threat to readiness in DoD.\u201d\n\n\u201cA combined effort like this is vitally important to protecting the health and safety of athletes at every level,\u201d said USADA CEO Travis T. Tygart.\u00a0 \u201cWe work to educate athletes on the risks associated with choosing to use supplements, and we will continue to support further action at a national level to prevent dangerous substances and products from being allowed in the marketplace where they can easily be attained by unsuspecting athletes and other consumers.\u201d\n\nTo promote today\u2019s joint sweep, the FTC created aninfographicto help consumers understand the range of dietary supplement products and claims, the potential risks of taking supplements and questions to ask a health professional before taking any supplements.\u00a0 The FTC also published blogs forconsumersandbusinesses, and has articles and videos with more information atftc.gov/dietary supplements.\n\nThe FDA continues to warn consumers about the risks associated with some over-the-counter products, falsely marketed as dietary supplements, which contain hidden active ingredients that could be harmful.\u00a0 In the last year, the agency haswarned of more than 100 productsfound to contain hidden active ingredients. These products are most frequently marketed forsexual enhancement,weight lossandbody building.\n\nWithin the last year, the FDA also sent warning letters to manufacturers selling dietary supplements that containBMPEAandDMBA, two ingredients that do not meet the statutory definition of a dietary ingredient as well as to several companies sellingpure powdered caffeineproducts that the agency determined to be dangerous and present a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury to consumers.",

            "article_text": "A federal grand jury issued a superseding indictment charging Chen Song with visa fraud, obstruction of justice, destruction of documents, and false statements in connection with a scheme to conceal and lie about her status as a member of the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s military forces while in the United States, the Justice Department announced\u00a0yesterday.\n\n\u201cWe allege that while Chen Song worked as a researcher at Stanford University, she was secretly a member of China\u2019s military, the People\u2019s Liberation Army,\u201d said\u00a0U.S. Attorney David L. Anderson for the Northern District of California.\u201cWhen Song feared discovery, she destroyed documents in a failed attempt to conceal her true identity. This prosecution will help to protect elite institutions like Stanford from illicit foreign influences.\u201d\n\n\"Members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army cannot lie on their visa applications and come to the United States to study without expecting the FBI and our partners to catch them.\" said Assistant Director Alan E. Kohler Jr. of the FBI's Counterintelligence Division. \"Time and again, the Chinese government prioritizes stealing U.S. research and taking advantage of our universities over obeying international norms.\"\n\n\u201cThe FBI\u2019s investigation revealed Song Chen took active steps to destroy evidence of her official affiliation with the Chinese military, including her current PLA credentials depicting her in military dress uniform,\u201d said\u00a0Special Agent in Charge Craig D. Fair of the FBI's San Francisco Field Office. \u201cThe FBI is committed to protecting academic institutions in the Bay Area from PRC military officers who knowingly and willfully lie about their military affiliations to access American research and development. We will exhaust all investigative techniques and measures to ensure the safety, security, and hard work of American universities.\u201d\n\nThe superseding indictment expands on the allegations set out in an affidavit supporting a criminal complaint filed on July 17, 2020, and an indictment filed on Jan. 7, 2021. According to the superseding indictment, Song, 39, a Chinese national, entered the United States on Dec. 23, 2018, using a J-1 non-immigrant visa to conduct research at Stanford University. Song obtained the J-1 visa, a document \u201cfor individuals approved to participate in work-and study-based exchange visitor programs\u201d with an application she submitted in November 2018.\n\nIn that application, Song described herself as a neurologist who was coming to the United States to conduct research at Stanford University related to brain disease. As part of the application, Song stated that she had served in the Chinese military only from Sept. 1, 2000, through June 30, 2011. She further stated that her employer was \u201cXi Diaoyutai Hospital\u201d located at \u201cNo. 30 Fucheng Road, Beijing, 100142,\u201d and that her highest rank was \u201cSTUDENT.\u201d The superseding indictment alleges that these were lies, and that Song was a member of the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA), the Chinese military, when she entered and while she was in the United States, and that the hospital she listed on her visa as her employer was a cover for her true employer, the PLA Air Force General Hospital in Beijing.\n\nThe superseding indictment also adds allegations and charges of obstructive conduct by Song.\u00a0Specifically, the superseding indictment alleges that Song found out about a case against another PLA member, who was charged on June 7, 2020, in the Northern District of California with visa fraud. The superseding indictment alleges that she then attempted to delete a digital folder of documents on an external hard drive that she possessed containing records relating to her military service and visa fraud, including:\n\nFurther, according to the superseding indictment, Song lied to FBI agents when interviewed, denying any affiliation with the PLA after 2011, and information associating Song with the PLA or Air Force General Hospital began to disappear from the Internet after the FBI\u2019s investigation of Song was known to her. Finally, the superseding indictment alleges that, after Song had been charged by criminal complaint in this case, she selectively deleted relevant emails from that account, including certain emails relevant to her military service, employment, and affiliations.\n\nSong is charged with visa fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546(a); obstruction of official proceedings, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01512(c)(2); two counts of alteration, destruction, mutilation, or concealment of records, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01512(c)(1); and making false statements to a government agency, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01001(a)(2).\n\nAn indictment merely alleges that a crime has been committed and Song, like all defendants, is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nIf convicted, she faces a maximum statutory penalty of up to 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000 for the visa fraud count; up to 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000 for each of the obstruction and alteration charges; and up to five years in prison and a fine of $250,000 for the false statements charge. In addition, the court may order additional terms of supervised release.\u00a0However, any sentence following conviction would be imposed by the court only after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553.\n\nSong\u2019s next appearance is scheduled for April 7, 2021, at 12:00 p.m. PST, before the Honorable William Alsup, U.S. District Judge, for pretrial conference, with a trial scheduled to begin on April 12, 2021.\n\nThe FBI San Francisco Field Office led the investigation. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office Special Prosecutions Section is prosecuting the case.",

Hochul, Jr. announced today that the Western District of New York Office recovered in Fiscal Year 2015, $88,246,428.15 as a result of wide-ranging efforts in criminal, civil and asset forfeiture cases. As a result, $9,089,436 was distributed to victims of crime in the past year and a record amount of the recovered monies were provided as aid to law enforcement agencies, and in large part, provided to taxpayers as a result of being transmitted to the United States Treasury.\n\nIn making the announcement, U.S. Attorney Hochul praised the hard work and dedication of Office attorneys and support staff that sought not only to put convicted defendants in jail, but took the profit out of crime in a more literal sense. \u201cThis Office strives mightily to protect the public by prosecuting those who would cause our residents harm.\u00a0 At the same time, we believe in the well-known saying \u201ccrime doesn\u2019t pay.\u201d To help make this phrase a reality for Western New Yorkers, our Office uses asset forfeiture laws and civil lawsuits to recover money for taxpayers, victims of crime, and local police departments.\u00a0 In other words, we don\u2019t just take the profit out of crime, we use it for the public good.\n\nThe $88,246,428.15 represents more than 8 \u00bd times the amount of money it took to operate the entire United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the year. \u201cBecause our budget is approximately $10 million, the recovered money in reality means taxpayers spent nothing for the protection and safety provided by this Office, and while also obtaining an additional $78,000,000 million in money it did not budget receiving through other means,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Hochul.\n\nSpecifically, the Office collected $76,130,788 in criminal and civil actions. Criminal actions, which include fines and restitution, totaled $9,809,269.57, most of which was returned to victims of crime. The Office collected $66,321,518.58 in civil actions, which include proceedings involving health care fraud, government fraud, foreclosures and more.In addition, the Office collected $12,115,640 in criminal and civil forfeitures.\u00a0 Forfeitures generally involve proceeds of crime, as well as property used to commit crime. Of that amount, a record amount of $3,768,043 was shared with state and local law enforcement partners who work with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and the Department of Justice.\n\nSince Mr. Hochul became U.S. Attorney, the Office has recovered and returned to victims, taxpayers and police agencies more than $322,000,000:\n\nFiscal Year 2010: $31,800,000;Fiscal Year 2011: $29,300,000;Fiscal Year 2012: $53,600,000;Fiscal Year 2013: $94,220,000;Fiscal Year 2014: $25,000,000.\n\nIn addition to recovering funds, in September 2015, Asset Forfeiture monies were used to demolish six forfeited drug houses on Buffalo\u2019s East Side.\u00a0 This represented the first time such an undertaking was ever accomplished in the United States. A total of 98 dangerous firearms, along with ammunition, and 79 computers and media devices were also forfeited in FY 2015 as instrumentalities of criminal conduct, mostly related to child exploitation cases.\n\nThe following cases are an example of a successful forfeiture and affirmative civil enforcement cases concluded this past year in the Western District of New York:\n\nUnited States v. Doran Feldman, et al.\n\nDoran Feldman was an anesthesiologist for CGF Anesthesia Associates, P.C. in Buffalo. Co-defendant Debra Bulter, who worked in the Department of Anesthesiology for the University of Rochester, started DJA Solutions, LLC to provide administrative consulting services to CGF. In 2001, CGF contracted with the Department of Anesthesiology at the University of Rochester to provide anesthesiologists at medical facilities served by the Department of Anesthesiology. The 2001 Contract was renewed six times by addenda during the fiscal years 2004 through 2009. In September 2007, in the sixth addendum to the 2001 Contract, CGF agreed to provide the Department of Anesthesiology with five anesthesiologists and up to four additional anesthesiologists if requested by the Department of Anesthesiology. The defendant and Bulter fraudulently used the term in the addendum regarding the four additional anesthesiologists to fraudulently cause the Department of Anesthesiology to pay an annual fee to themselves under the terms of a purported option agreement. As a result of the offense, the Department of Anesthesiology at the University of Rochester sustained a loss of $1,460,000.00. Feldman was sentenced to 24 months in prison and ordered to pay $1,460,000.00 in restitution to the Department of Anesthesiology at the University of Rochester and forfeit a number of bank accounts.\n\nUnited States v. Magness, et al.\n\nA total of over $600,000 was forfeited from defendants Gregory Magness, Eldon Bott, Charles Wright and William Nehill in a case which involved the smuggling of magnesium into the United States from China that was used to produce counter measure flares for the U.S. Department of Defense. The defendants were also ordered to pay restitution totaling $6,246,605 to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection for the loss of duty to the United States. At the time of the importations, the U.S. had a 305.56% antidumping duty in place with respect to magnesium imported from China.\u00a0 In order to avoid the antidumping duty, the defendants falsely mislabeled the magnesium as a magnesium product only subject to a 5% duty, thereby defrauding the United States out of lawful duties.\u00a0 In addition to the over $600,000 forfeited, over $2,000,000 in restitution has already been collected from the defendants towards the restitution.\n\nUnited States v. Cusimano\n\nEric Cusimano and other individuals participated in a scheme to commit securities fraud by registering internet websites to tout and promote publically traded stocks of companies with penny stock prices. Cusimano promoted the stocks on his\u00a0 websites and newsletters to boost the stock value and then sell their shares at the highest value. This is known as a \u201cpump and dump\u201d scheme. Cusimano, along with his wife, fled the United States for Panama upon learning of the investigation. The defendant was eventually arrested and brought back to the United States to face charges. Cusimano was convicted of conspiracy and tax evasion and sentenced to 46 months in prison and ordered to pay restitution to the Internal Revenue Service totaling $657,005.00 and a forfeiture money judgment in the sum of $1,218,783.00. In addition, the defendant forfeited an additional $336,522.86 that he had concealed in a number of bank accounts in Belize, various gold and silver jewelry items valued at $42,000.00 that he was found with in Panama, and a 30 foot pontoon boat that was forfeited early on in the investigation.\n\nUnited States v. AquillaFrank Aquila served as the chief negotiator for the Buffalo Educational Support Team (\"BEST\"), a labor organization comprised of approximately nine hundred (900) City of Buffalo teacher's aides during 2008 collective bargaining negotiations with the City of Buffalo School District. Aquila refused to reach final agreement with the district on a collective bargaining agreement until and unless the district agreed to allow BEST to (1) select its own insurance broker; (2) make commission payments totaling $135,000 per year for four years to an insurance broker selected by BEST; and (3) agreed to make four payments to BEST of $65,000 each for costs and expenses associated with administering health insurance benefits for its members. The defendant failed to disclose to the district or BEST that he would share in commissions paid to the insurance broker selected by BEST, and in payments made to BEST to administer health insurance benefits for its members. Aquila was convicted and required to pay restitution in the amount of $332,500 to the City of Buffalo School District. The defendant also forfeited an additional $33,000 to the government.\n\nUnited States v. Fitzgerald\n\nCharles Darwin Fitzgerald was convicted of possession with intent to distribute various synthetic controlled substances and synthetic controlled substance analogues at both his residence in Rochester and at one of his stores that he owned, the 420 Emporium located in Batavia, NY.\u00a0 The defendant was Fitzgerald was sentenced to 30 months in prison and ordered to forfeit $771,109 in U.S. currency that was seized during the execution of a search warrant at his residence.\n\nUnited States v. Amedisys\n\nBetween 2008 and 2010, certain Amedisys offices improperly billed Medicare for ineligible patients and services. Amedisys allegedly billed Medicare for nursing and therapy services that were medically unnecessary or provided to patients who were not homebound, and otherwise misrepresented patients\u2019 conditions to increase its Medicare payments. These billing violations were the alleged result of management pressure on nurses and therapists to provide care based on the financial benefits to Amedisys, rather than the needs of patients. The settlement was for $150 million dollars.\u00a0 The majority was paid up from and $35 million paid this year.\n\nFor further information, the United States Attorneys\u2019 Annual Statistical Reports can be found on the internet at:\n\nhttp://www.justice.gov/usao/reading_room/foiamanuals.html.\\\n\n",

            "article_text": "HOUSTON \u2013 U.S. Attorney Alamdar S. Hamdani has announced he will resign as chief law enforcement officer for the Southern District of Texas (SDTX) effective midnight Jan. 19.\n\n\u201cServing as the 24th Presidentially Appointed U.S. Attorney for this incredible district has been the honor of a lifetime,\u201d said Hamdani. \u201cOver the past two years, we have made significant strides across multiple fronts, strengthening our community, upholding justice and ensuring safety for all citizens.\"\n\nHamdani was responsible for prosecuting and defending the interests of the United States in one of the largest districts in the country - covering 44,000 square miles and representing over nine million people. He oversaw over 400 employees, including approximately 200 Assistant U.S. Attorneys who cover the seven offices across the district.\n\nIn just over two years as U.S. Attorney, Hamdani led the office in approximately more than 10 thousand criminal cases against over 12 thousand defendants while maintaining an average 95% conviction rate. From fentanyl to the cartels, crimes involving children to human smuggling and white collar crime to cybercrime, Hamdani worked to ensure justice was served every day and the SDTX was a safe place to live.\n\nThe Civil Division filed more than 2,500 cases in fiscal years 2023-2024, which included a historic$85 million settlementagainst a cardiac imaging company. \u201cPatients deserve care based on their medical need and not on a doctor or company\u2019s financial interest or gain,\u201d Hamdani said. The Texas Medical Center also agreed to pay a record$15 millionfor allegations of concurrent billing claims for critical surgeries.\n\nThe office was at the forefront of numerous new and ongoing issues to include violent crime, which was at record levels when he took office. He made several announcements on numerous cases againstfelons illegally in possession of firearmsto those involvingknown gang members. As part of those efforts, the office partnered with the Department of Justice\u2019s Violent Crime and Racketeering Section as part of the Department\u2019s Violent Crime Initiative which contributed to a reduction in violent crime over the past two years.\n\nHe also worked with the three other Texas U.S. Attorneys in acoordinated announcementon a statewide effort targeting machine gun conversion devices.\n\nHamdani placed particular emphasis on cases linked to Mexican cartels, often noting how their violence spreads into the district. This included a matter out of the Galveston Division which saw thearrest of 23in a poly-drug indictment. Noting that \u201cFentanyl-laced pills disguised as something else are killing our kids,\u201d Hamdani and his office targeted those dealing the drug that destroys lives and families andanyonewho provided it to others. As part of the effort, Hamdani also announced charges against aChinese nationalfor his alleged part in a conspiracy involving the importation of what is believed to be the largest amount of fentanyl precursors - chemicals used to make fentanyl - in the SDTX.\n\nHe also targeted cybercrime, often speaking and participating in numerous conferences on the topic. In one matter of note, the office helped disrupt abotnetthat used hundreds of U.S.-based small office/home office routers so that People\u2019s Republic of China state-sponsored hackers could monitor key parts of American infrastructure.\n\nSpending much of his career prosecuting cases involving national security matters, Hamdani continued that focus as U.S. Attorney, from thoseattempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organizationto another whoallegedly exported U.S. technology to Iran.\n\nHamdani\u2019s office also targeted deadly human smuggling organizations, including a Brownsville matter that saw the conviction of six men who werechargedin an alien smuggling ring which resulted in the death of eight people. To further combat the issue, the office also participated in Joint Task Force Alpha, which the Attorney General created to marshal and combat the rise in prolific and dangerous smuggling and trafficking groups operating in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. And just a few weeks ago, as part of that mission, the officeunsealed chargesagainst several defendants for the death of over 50 migrants in an overturned trailer in Chiapas, Mexico.\n\nA similar issue due to the proximity to the border is human trafficking, and the office continued its efforts to combat this troubling crime throughout the district and provide for victims, such as a woman who received30 yearsfor forcing young girls to engage in commercial sex.\n\nA father himself, Hamdani also sought to make sure those committing crimes against children were held accountable. One such criminal was recently sentenced to100 yearsin prison for raping two children. On the other end of the spectrum, he emphasized protecting the elderly from those who take advantage of them, such as those who tricked a WWII veteran out of $300,000 to many that are involved inIndian call centerswho often target the elderly.\n\nThe office increased efforts to hold those committing white collar crime and health care fraud accountable, such as a Houston man who wasconvictedin a $160M Medicare fraud scheme.\u00a0Another significant matter and a focus of the office was a company charged with violating theForeign Corrupt Practices Actwho agreed to pay $160 million. \u201cProsecuting and investigating this type of crime is an important role our office takes seriously in order to ensure fair and equal playing fields for U.S. companies and consumers,\u201d Hamdani noted.\n\nIn October 2023, Attorney General Merrick Garland picked Hamdani to serve on the Attorney General\u2019s Advisory Committee. Hamdani, along with 13 other U.S. Attorneys, advised the Attorney General on behalf of the U.S. Attorney community. While in this role, he also led the Border and Immigration Law Enforcement Subcommittee which included U.S. Attorneys along the Northern and Southern borders working together to secure both those borders from transnational criminal organizations, cartels, gun, drugs and human smuggling.\n\nDuring his tenure, Hamdani made it a priority to get the news of the office\u2019s important work to the people, so as to inform some and deter others from committing crime. He used multiple platforms, including the use of social media clips, to ensure these messages were heard.\n\nHe is\u00a0proud to have run his office under the \u201cmama rule.\u201d Citing his own mother\u2019s history as a poor migrant and her age, his mantra was that you treat and protect others as you would your own \u201cmama.\u201d\n\nHamdani was the first Asian in Texas that was presidentially appointed and senate confirmed as U.S. Attorney. He was born in England to Indian parents who had moved there from India. The family immigrated to Texas when he was 10. He received his J.D. from the University of Houston Law Center in 1999 and his B.B.A. from the University of Texas at Austin in 1993.\n\nHamdani joined the SDTX in 2014, but has been with the Department of Justice since 2008. As an AUSA with the SDTX, he was primarily responsible for the investigation and prosecution of national security and official corruption crimes. From 2010 to 2014, Hamdani served in the Counterterrorism Section of the Department of Justice\u2019s National Security Division, holding the position of deputy chief from 2012 to 2014. Before that, he was an AUSA in the Eastern District of Kentucky.\n\nPrior to his government service, Hamdani was in private practice.\n\nHe is married and is a proud father of two teenagers, a University of Texas Longhorn and Bellaire High School Cardinal.\n\nAs he departs the office, he is reminded of the privilege he enjoyed to lead a group of dedicated public servants who work every day to make Texas safer, noting that \u201cwe love mercy, walk humbly and always, always, seek justice.\u201d",

            "article_text": "BOSTON \u2013 The former men\u2019s soccer coach at the University of California \u2013 Los Angeles (UCLA), entered a guilty plea today in connection with his involvement in a scheme to use bribery and fraud to facilitate the admission of applicants to UCLA.\n\nJorge Salcedo, 47, of Los Angeles, Calif., entered a guilty plea as to one count of conspiracy to commit racketeering. U.S. District Court Judge Indira Talwani deferred acceptance of the plea until sentencing, which is scheduled for Nov. 24, 2020. According to the terms of the plea agreement, the government will recommend a sentence at the low end of the sentencing guidelines, one year of supervised release, a fine, forfeiture in the amount of $200,000 and restitution.\n\nIn 2016, Salcedo agreed with William \u201cRick\u201d Singer, Ali Khosroshahin \u2013 a former head coach of women\u2019s soccer at the University of Southern California \u2013 and others to facilitate the admission of the daughter of Davina and Bruce Isackson to UCLA as a purported women\u2019s soccer recruit. Salcedo emailed the UCLA women\u2019s soccer coaches the Isacksons\u2019 daughter\u2019s transcript, test scores, and a fake soccer profile that he had received from Singer and Khosroshahin. When UCLA compliance officers questioned how the Isacksons\u2019 daughter was discovered and whether she actually played soccer, Salcedo created a fake backstory about how he learned about the Isacksons\u2019 daughter through a club team coach. Around June 29, 2016, UCLA provisionally admitted the Isacksons\u2019 daughter as a recruited walk-on for the women\u2019s soccer team. For his part in the deal, Salcedo received $100,000 of the $250,000 that the Isacksons paid Singer.\n\nIn 2018, Salcedo agreed with Singer and Khosroshahin to \u201crecruit\u201d the son of Xiaoning Sui, another client of Singer\u2019s, to the UCLA men\u2019s soccer team despite the fact that Sui\u2019s son did not play soccer competitively. In the recruitment paperwork, Salcedo falsely reported that he had seen Sui\u2019s son play in China and that he planned to offer him a 25% scholarship which would be \u201cgood value\u201d for a player of his quality. Around Nov. 6, 2018, as a result of Salcedo\u2019s recruitment, Sui\u2019s son was admitted to UCLA as a student-athlete on the men\u2019s soccer team with a 25% scholarship. In exchange, Salcedo accepted a $100,000 bribe from Singer, who had been paid $400,000 by Sui.\n\nSalcedo also agreed with Singer to recruit another student. During a consensually recorded call on Nov. 30, 2018, Singer proposed to Salcedo that he had another student for Salcedo to recruit who was not a \u201creal soccer player.\u201d Singer asked Salcedo if they could \u201cdo the same deal we did with\u201d Sui\u2019s son. After Singer clarified that the deal would be for 2020, Salcedo affirmed that he could give the student a scholarship in return for $100,000.\n\nSinger, Khosroshahin, Davina and Bruce Isackson, and Sui have all pleaded guilty to their roles in the offense. Sui was sentenced to time served of approximately five months in prison. Singer, Khosroshahin and Davina and Bruce Isackson are cooperating with the government\u2019s investigation.\n\nCase information, including the status of each defendant, charging documents and plea agreements are available here:https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/investigations-college-admissions-and-testing-bribery-scheme.\n\nThe charge of racketeering conspiracy provides for a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release, a fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss, whichever is greater and restitution. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nUnited States Attorney Andrew E. Lelling; Joseph R. Bonavolonta, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Boston Field Division; and Kristina O\u2019Connell, Special Agent in Charge of the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s Criminal Investigations in Boston made the announcement today. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Eric S. Rosen, Justin D. O\u2019Connell, Leslie A. Wright, Kristen A. Kearney, Karin M. Bell and Stephen E. Frank of Lelling\u2019s Criminal Division are prosecuting the case.",

Anderson and Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent in Charge John F. Bennett.\n\nAccording to court documents filed today and a complaint which was unsealed on Monday, Wang entered the United States on March 26, 2019, after receiving a multiple entry J1 non-immigrant visa in December of 2018.\u00a0 Wang\u2019s visa application stated that the purpose of his visit was to conduct scientific research at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).\u00a0 Wang is alleged to have made fraudulent statements on this visa application.\u00a0 Specifically, in his visa application, Wang stated that he had served as an Associate Professor in Medicine in the PLA, from September 1, 2002 through September 1, 2016.\n\nIn reality, when interviewed by officers of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at LAX on June 7, 2020, Wang provided information that he was, in fact, still currently a \u201cLevel 9\u201d technician in the PLA, employed by a military university lab.\u00a0 CBP officers also obtained information that this roughly corresponded with the level of Major, and that Wang had received compensation from the PLA and the China Scholarship Council\u2014in addition to compensation from UCSF\u2014while in the United States.\u00a0 According to court documents, Wang was still employed by the PLA while he was studying in the United States and he made false statements about his military service in his visa application in order to increase the likelihood that he would receive his J1 visa.\n\nAlso according to court documents, Wang provided information to CBP that he had been instructed by his supervisor, the director of his military university lab in the PRC, to observe the layout of the UCSF lab and bring back information on how to replicate it in China.\u00a0 CBP received information that Wang had studies from UCSF with him which he was taking to share with his PLA colleagues, and he had sent research to his lab in China via email.\u00a0 Wang similarly told his supervising UCSF professor that he had duplicated some of the work of that professor at the lab in China.\u00a0 Some of the work of the UCSF lab was funded by grants from the United States Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health (NIH).\u00a0 Wang also wiped his personal phone of WeChat messaging content earlier the morning he arrived at LAX.\n\nWang is charged with visa fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01546(a).\u00a0 If convicted, he faces a maximum statutory penalty of ten years in prison and a fine of $250,000.\n\nWang made his initial appearance on Monday, June 8, 2020, in the Central District of California before Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Chooljian, and was detained for further proceedings.\u00a0 His next appearance is scheduled for Friday, June 12, 2020, at 10 a.m., before Judge Chooljian, for a detention hearing.\n\nThe case is being prosecuted by the Special Prosecutions Section of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.\u00a0 The case is being investigated by the FBI.",

            "article_text": "FRESNO, Calif. \u2014 Jia Bei Zhu, aka Jesse Zhu, aka Qiang He, aka David He, 62, a citizen of China who formerly resided in Clovis, was arrested today on a criminal complaint for manufacturing and distributing misbranded medical devices in violation of the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and for making false statements to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), U.S. Attorney Phillip A. Talbert announced.\n\n\u201cAs part of his scheme, the defendant changed his name, the names of his companies, and their locations,\u201d U.S. Attorney Talbert said. \u201cThe disarray at the Reedley lab led to the glare of publicity he was trying to avoid, and the ensuing investigation unraveled his efforts to circumvent the requirements that are designed to ensure that medical devices are safe and effective.\u201d\n\n\u201cProviding materially false information to FDA inspectors regarding medical device manufacturing and distribution impedes the agency\u2019s ability to protect public health, especially when those false statements relate to unauthorized and misbranded COVID-19 tests. Consumers who unknowingly use these misbranded COVID tests run the risk of incorrect results about their COVID status, which can lead to further spread of the virus,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Robert M. Iwanicki, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations Los Angeles Field Office. \u201cWe will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who jeopardize the health of U.S. consumers.\u201d\n\nAccording to court documents, between December 2020 and March 2023, Zhu and others manufactured, imported, sold, and distributed hundreds of thousands of COVID-19 test kits, in addition to test kits for HIV, pregnancy, clinical urinalysis, and other conditions in the United States and China. They did so through the companies Universal Meditech Incorporated (UMI) and Prestige Biotech Incorporated (PBI), which were based in Fresno and Reedley. UMI and PBI did not obtain the required authorizations to manufacture and distribute the test kits and mislabeled some of the test kits. When questioned by FDA officials, Zhu made false statements about his identity, his ownership and control of UMI and PBI, and the activities of UMI and PBI.\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint, Reedley Code Enforcement officials received a complaint regarding a warehouse in Reedley for using non-permitted plumbing that was visible from outside the warehouse. When code enforcement officials went to the warehouse the next day, they saw various types of in vitro diagnostic test kits, related manufacturing equipment, and shipping supplies.\n\nFurther investigation found that UMI first registered as a medical device manufacturer with the FDA in November 2015 in Tulare and moved to Fresno in 2018. FDA records show that its registration lapsed in 2022, and it is no longer permitted to manufacture or import any in vitro diagnostic test kits in the United States. Any test kits that the company manufactured or imported after that date are considered misbranded medical devices.\n\nTo manufacture, import, and distribute COVID-19 test kits in the United States during the pandemic, a company must have applied for, and ultimately received, an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA. According to FDA records, UMI applied for an EUA for its COVID-19 test kits, but never received it due to major deficiencies in UMI\u2019s test studies.\n\nIn November 2022, Fresno County officials notified UMI that they were going to inspect UMI\u2019s Fresno facility to ensure everything was up to code following a fire that occurred at the facility. FDA officials then received an email from UMI\u2019s attorney saying that the company had gone out of business and sold its assets to PBI, a company that was formed in Las Vegas, Nevada. PBI was never registered with the FDA to manufacture or import any in vitro diagnostic test kits in the United States, and never received an EUA to manufacture and distribute COVID-19 test kits. Therefore, any such test kits would be misbranded medical devices.\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint, during the investigation, Zhu made several false statements to FDA officials, including that his name was Qiang \u201cDavid\u201d He; that he was hired by UMI as a COVID-19 consultant in 2021; that he was hired by PBI just a couple of weeks ago to communicate with government agencies and dispose of property at the warehouse as requested by those agencies; that he did not know anything about the manufacturing or distribution histories for UMI or PBI; and that he knew nothing about an Amazon webpage showing PBI\u2011branded pregnancy test kits for sale or a shipment of 47,500 pregnancy test kits from China to UMI at an address in Las Vegas.\n\nThis case is the product of an investigation by the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, with assistance from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the California Department of Public Health \u2013 Food and Drug Branch. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Joseph D. Barton, Arelis M. Clemente, and Henry Z. Carbajal III are prosecuting this case.\n\nIf convicted, Zhu faces a maximum statutory penalty of three years in prison for the misbranding of medical devices charge, and five more years in prison for the false statements charge. Any sentence, however, would be determined at the discretion of the court after consideration of any applicable statutory factors and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which take into account a number of variables. The charges are only allegations; the defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.",

            "article_text": "TAMPA,  Fla. \u2013 The Missal of Ludovico da  Romagnano, a 15th century manuscript known as the San Lorenzo, was repatriated to  the Italian government Monday by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s  (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). It was stolen nearly 25 years ago  from the Capitular Archive of the Archdiocese in Turin, Italy.\n\nA. Lee Bentley III, U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Florida, Susan  McCormick, special agent in charge of HSI Tampa, , and Adolfo Barattolo, the consul general for the Italian  Consulate in Miami, participated in the repatriation ceremony.\n\nIn 1990, the Archdiocese in Turin hired a team of  professors to inventory the church\u2019s ancient archives in preparation for an  upcoming exhibit. After that inventory concluded, the Archdiocese determined  263 parchment pages had been cut from a missal, a breviary and an antiphonary.  They were all from the same collection. Additionally, a number of rare books  were missing from the archives.\n\nItalian authorities conducted an investigation that  resulted in the arrest of two individuals \u2013 Pier Luigi Cimma and Franca Gatto.  These individuals, husband and wife, were two of the professors who  participated in the 1990 inventory, which provided them access to the church\u2019s  ancient archives.\u00a0 Cimma and Gatto  confessed to the authorities that they had stolen several items, most of which  they sold to a bookseller in Turin, Italy. The Monza Nucleo dei Carabinieri  Tutela Patrimonio Culturale in Italy, a specialized police unit for cultural  property, recovered some of the stolen items from Sotheby\u2019s in London.\n\nIn April 2011, an officer from the Carabinieri unit discovered  a newspaper article from January 2006 online. That article detailed information  on an upcoming exhibition at the Florida International Museum called \u201cInk and  Blood.\u201d The exhibit detailed the development of the Bible. The article touched  on an illuminated manuscript promised to the Special Collections Department at  the University of South Florida Library. The manuscript was from a 15th  century Italian missal, which was not only a religious document, but also a common  form of art in the Middle Ages.\n\nThe Carabinieri called Professor Constanza Montel  Segre as an expert witness in June 2011 to confirm the manuscript featured in  this newspaper article was the one stolen from the archives. She confirmed with  certainty that the 15th century manuscript was the San Lorenzo, page  212 from the Missal of Ludovico da Romagnano.\n\nIn March 2012, HSI Tampa received a mutual legal  assistance treaty request from the Italian government for assistance in, among  other things, recovering the manuscript. With assistance of the University of  South Florida, HSI special agents located the manuscript at a residence in St.  Petersburg. The individuals in possession of the manuscript were unaware it had  been stolen and exported from Italy in violation of Italian law. They had  purchased the manuscript in 1997 from an art dealer in Islamorada, and they  provided a receipt for the purchase.\n\nWith information taken from the sale receipt, HSI  special agents located and interviewed the owners of the Islamorada antique  book and map store where the St. Petersburg couple purchased the manuscript. The  store owners often traveled to England to attend book auctions and other  similar events to obtain items for their store. The item was likely purchased  in England \u2013 where the Italian government had previously located several other  stolen Italian artifacts \u2013 and transported back to the United States. The store  owners did not know the manuscript was stolen.\n\nThrough his attorney, the individual in possession of  the manuscript voluntarily surrendered the stolen manuscript to the U.S.  government in June 2012.\n\n\u201cInternational cooperation with our law enforcement  partners was essential to the success of our investigation,\u201d said Susan  McCormick, special agent in charge of HSI Tampa. \u201cThrough our partnership with  Italian authorities, we were able to track down and authenticate that the  manuscript we located in St. Petersburg was indeed the 15th century  San Lorenzo, an important piece of Italy\u2019s cultural heritage.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Washington Office of Homeland Security Investigations  informed me that a manuscript stolen from the ancient curial archives in Turin,  Italy, was recovered through the University of South Florida, who posted its  photo on their website, ultimately leading the Homeland Security investigators  to its recovery,\u201d said Adolfo Barattolo, consul general for the Italian  Consulate in Miami. \u201cThe significance of criminal theft of national treasures  goes well beyond its monetary and artistic values, as it is a crime against  culture itself, which is of great importance to Italy. \u00a0Italy has more  items on the Unesco World Heritage List than any other country, including  historic cities, monuments, works of art, sculptures and landscapes. In this  context, I am grateful to Tampa Homeland Security Investigations for recovering  the artifact and for their prompt and constant contact and courtesy provided to  this consulate general in Miami.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, the United States  returns to Italy a stolen manuscript that, 700 years ago, was beautifully hand  painted by an unknown Lombardian monk,\u201d said A. Lee Bentley III, acting U.S. attorney.  \u201cIn doing so, we have faithfully discharged our duties under our Treaty with the  Republic of Italy, knowing that we have protected the interests of our friend  and ally and protected a small piece of a historical legacy that belongs to all  of us.\u201d\n\nHSI  plays a leading role in criminal investigations that involve the illegal  importation and distribution of cultural property, including the illicit  trafficking of cultural property, especially objects that have been reported  lost or stolen. The HSI Office of International Affairs, through its 67 attach\u00e9  offices in 48 countries, works closely with foreign governments to conduct  joint investigations, when possible.\n\nHSI  specially trained investigators, assigned to both domestic and international  offices, partner with governments, agencies and experts to protect cultural  antiquities. They also provide cultural property investigative training to law  enforcement partners for crimes involving stolen property and art, and how to  best enforce the law to recover these items when they emerge in the  marketplace.\n\nSince  2007, more than 7,150 artifacts have been returned to 26 countries, including  paintings from France, Germany, Poland and Austria, 15th to 18th century  manuscripts from Italy and Peru, as well as cultural artifacts from China, Cambodia  and Iraq.\n\nMembers of the public who have information about  suspected stolen cultural property are urged to call the toll-free HSI tip line  at 1-866-DHS-2-ICE or complete itsonline tip form.\n\n(Download Factual Basis )\n\n(Photograph   )",

            "article_text": "\u201cCollege\u201d created as part of Homeland Security Investigations sting operation\n\nNEWARK, N.J. -\u00a0Twenty-one brokers, recruiters, and employers from across the United States who allegedly conspired with more than 1,000 foreign nationals to fraudulently maintain student visas and obtain foreign worker visas through a \u201cpay to stay\u201d New Jersey college were arrested this morning by federal agents, New Jersey U.S. Attorney Paul J. Fishman announced.\n\nThe defendants (see chart below) were arrested in New Jersey and Washington by special agents with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and charged in 14 complaints with conspiracy to commit visa fraud, conspiracy to harbor aliens for profit, and other offenses. All the defendants, with the exception of Yanjun Lin, will appear today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Steven C. Mannion in Newark federal court.\u00a0 Lin will appear before U.S. Magistrate Judge Karen L. Strombom in the Western District of Washington federal court.\n\n\u201c\u2018Pay to Stay\u2019 schemes not only damage our perception of legitimate student and foreign worker visa programs, they also pose a very real threat to national security,\u201d U.S. Attorney Fishman said. \u201cToday\u2019s arrests, which were made possible by the great undercover work of our law enforcement partners, stopped 21 brokers, recruiters and employers across multiple states who recklessly exploited our immigration system for financial gain.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile the United States fully supports international education, we will vigorously investigate those who seek to exploit the U.S. immigration system,\u201dsaid ICE Director Sarah R. Salda\u00f1a. \u201cAs a result of this operation, HSI special agents have successfully identified and shut down multiple operations which have abused the student visa program.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndividuals engaged in schemes that would undermine the remarkable educational opportunities afforded to international students represent an affront to those who play by the rules. These unscrupulous individuals undermine the integrity of the immigration system,\u201d said ICE Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent in Charge Terence S. Opiola. \u201cOur special agents are committed to addressing, identifying fraud in order to better protect the system as a whole.\u201d\n\nAccording to the complaints unsealed today and statements made in court:\n\nThe defendants, many of whom operated recruiting companies for purported international students, were arrested for their involvement in an alleged scheme to enroll foreign nationals as students in the University of Northern New Jersey, a purported for-profit college located in Cranford, New Jersey (UNNJ). Unbeknownst to the defendants and the foreign nationals they conspired with, however, the UNNJ was created in September 2013 by HSI federal agents.\n\nThrough the UNNJ, undercover HSI agents investigated criminal activities associated with the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), including, but not limited to, student visa fraud and the harboring of aliens for profit.\u00a0 The UNNJ was not staffed with instructors or educators, had no curriculum, and conducted no actual classes or education activities. The UNNJ operated solely as a storefront location with small offices staffed by federal agents posing as school administrators.\n\nUNNJ represented itself as a school that, among other things, was authorized to issue a document known as a \u201cCertificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant (F-1) Student Status - for Academic and Language Students,\u201d commonly referred to as a Form I-20.\u00a0 This document, which certifies that a foreign national has been accepted to a school and would be a full-time student, typically enables legitimate foreign students to obtain an F-1 student visa.\u00a0 The F-1 student visa allows a foreign student to enter and/or remain in the United States while the student makes normal progress toward the completion of a full course of study in an SEVP accredited institution.\n\nDuring the investigation, HSI special agents identified hundreds of foreign nationals, primarily from China and India, who previously entered the U.S. on F-1 non-immigrant student visas to attend other SEVP- accredited schools.\u00a0 Through various recruiting companies and business entities located in New Jersey, California, Illinois, New York, and Virginia, the defendants then enabled approximately 1,076 of these foreign individuals \u2013 all of whom were willing participants in the scheme \u2013\u00a0to fraudulently maintain their nonimmigrant status in the U.S. on the false pretense that they continued to participate in full courses of study at the UNNJ.\n\nActing as recruiters, the defendants solicited the involvement of UNNJ administrators to participate in the scheme. During the course of their dealings with undercover agents, the defendants fully acknowledged that none of their foreign national clients would attend any actual courses, earn actual credits, or make academic progress toward an actual degree in a particular field of study.\u00a0 Rather, the defendants facilitated the enrollment of their foreign national clients in UNNJ to fraudulently maintain student visa status, in exchange for kickbacks, or \u201ccommissions.\u201d\u00a0 The defendants also facilitated the creation of hundreds of false student records, including transcripts, attendance records, and diplomas, which were purchased by their foreign national conspirators for the purpose of deceiving immigration authorities.\n\nIn other instances, the defendants used UNNJ to fraudulently obtain work authorization and work visas for hundreds of their clients.\u00a0 By obtaining this authorization, a number of defendants were able to outsource their foreign national clients as full-time employees with numerous U.S.-based corporations, also in exchange for commission fees.\u00a0 Other defendants devised phony IT projects that were\u00a0purportedly to occur at the school.\u00a0 These defendants then created and caused to be created false contracts, employment verification letters, transcripts, and other documents.\u00a0 The defendants then paid the undercover agents thousands of dollars to put the school\u2019s letterhead on the sham documents, to sign the documents as school administrators, and to otherwise go along with the scheme.\n\nAll of these bogus documents created the illusion that prospective foreign workers would be working at the school in some IT capacity or project.\u00a0 The defendants then used these fictitious documents fraudulently to obtain labor certifications issued by the U.S. Secretary of Labor and then ultimately to petition the U.S. government to obtain H1-B visas for non-immigrants.\u00a0 These fictitious documents were then submitted to the U.S. Customs and Immigration Services (USCIS).\u00a0 In the vast majority of circumstances, the foreign worker visas were not issued because USCIS was advised of the ongoing undercover operation.\n\nIn addition, starting today, HSI Newark is coordinating with the ICE Counterterrorism and Criminal Exploitation Unit (CTCEU) and the SEVP to terminate the nonimmigrant student status for the foreign nationals associated with UNNJ, and if applicable, administratively arrest and place them into removal proceedings.\n\nThe chart below outlines the charges for each defendant. The charges of conspiracy to commit visa fraud and making a false statement each carry a maximum potential penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. The charges of conspiracy to harbor aliens for profit and H1-B Visa fraud each carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and $250,000 fine.\n\nThe charges and allegations contained in the complaints are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\n\nU.S. Attorney Fishman credited special agents of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, under the leadership of Director Sarah R. Salda\u00f1a; HSI Newark, under the leadership of Special Agent in Charge Terence S. Opiola; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Counterterrorism and Criminal Exploitation Unit, under the leadership of Unit Chief Robert Soria;\u00a0 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Fraud Detection and National Security Section, under the leadership of Associate Director Matthew Emrich; the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, under the leadership of Deputy Assistant Director Louis M.

Brouillette; U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Office of Fraud Prevention Programs, under the leadership of Director Josh Glazeroff; and the FBI, Joint Terrorism Task Force, under the leadership of Timothy Gallagher in Newark, for their contributions to the investigation.\n\nHe also thanked the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges (ACCSC), under the leadership of Executive Director Michale S. McComis, and the N.J. Office of Higher Education, under the leadership of Secretary of Higher Education Rochelle R. Hendricks, for their assistance. In addition, U.S. Attorney Fishman thanked the N.J. Motor Vehicle Commission and the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles, as well as the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices for the Central District of California, Eastern District of New York, Eastern District of Virginia, Southern District of New York, Central District of Illinois, Peoria Division, and the Northern District of Georgia for their help.\n\nThe government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney Dennis C.

            "article_text": "ALBUQUERQUE \u2013 This afternoon, a federal judge in the District of New Mexico sentenced two Chinese nationals for conspiring to violate the Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) by scheming to illegally export defense articles with military application to the People\u2019s Republic of China, announced Assistant Attorney General for National Security John P. Carlin and U.S. Attorney Damon P. Martinez of the District of New Mexico.\n\nBo Cai, 29, of Nanjing, China, was sentenced to 24 months in prison and his cousin Wentong Cai, 30, of Chifeng, China, was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison.\u00a0 Both will be deported after completing their prison sentences.\u00a0 The two men were charged in three-count superseding indictment with a scheme to illegally export sensors primarily manufactured for sale to the U.S. Department of Defense for use in high-level applications, such as line-of-sight stabilization and precision motion control systems.\u00a0 The Arms Export Control Act and the ITAR prohibit the export of defense-related materials from the United States without obtaining a license or written approval from the U.S. Department of State.\n\nBo Cai entered a guilty plea to all three counts of the superseding indictment in July 2014, and Wentong Cai pleaded guilty to Count 3 of the superseding indictment in December 2014.\u00a0 In entering the guilty pleas, each admitted that from March 2012 to December 2013, they conspired with each other to illegally export sensors from the United States to China without first obtaining the required export license.\u00a0 Bo Cai admitted that in March 2012, while he was employed by a technology company in China, he embarked on an illegal scheme to smuggle sensors out of the United States to China for one of his customers despite knowledge that the sensors could not be exported without a license and that the United States did not issue licenses to export the sensors to China.\u00a0 Wentong Cai admitted that while he was in the United States on a student visa, Bo Cai enlisted him to acquire the sensors under the ruse that he planned to use the sensors at Iowa State University where he was a graduate microbiology student.\n\nCourt filings indicate that the investigation of this case began in October 2013, when an undercover U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agent responded to Wentong Cai\u2019s overtures. \u00a0After negotiations by telephone and email, in December 2013, Bo Cai and Wentong Cai traveled to New Mexico, where they obtained a sensor from undercover HSI agents and developed a plan for smuggling the sensor out of the United States to China.\u00a0 On Dec. 11, 2013, Bo Cai was arrested at an airport in Los Angeles, as he was preparing to board a flight to China, after the sensor was discovered concealed in a computer speaker in his luggage.\u00a0 Wentong Cai subsequently was arrested on Jan. 22, 2014, in Ames, Iowa.\n\nThe HSI Albuquerque, New Mexico, office led the investigation of this case with assistance from the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations, the Defense Security Service, HSI in Iowa and Los Angeles, the FBI and the U.S. Department of State.\u00a0 Iowa State University cooperated throughout with HSI\u2019s investigation.\u00a0 Assistant U.S. Attorneys Dean S. Tuckman and Fred J. Federici of the District of New Mexico prosecuted the case with assistance from Deputy Chief Deborah Curtis and Trial Attorneys David Recker and Brian Fleming of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division. \u00a0The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office of the Central District of California and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office of the Southern District of Iowa also assisted in the prosecution.",

            "article_text": "Tampa, Florida \u2013 U.S. District Judge William F. Jung today sentenced Pen Yu (51, Taiwan) to three years and eight months in federal prison for conspiracy to commit wire fraud, followed by three years of supervised release. As part of his sentence, the court also entered an order of forfeiture in the amount of $100,000, the proceeds of the wire fraud.\n\nYu was found guilty on May 2, 2024. Co-conspirator Gregory Mu\u00f1oz was found guilty on May 9, 2024, and co-conspirator Jonathan Thyng was found guilty on July 23, 2024.\n\nAccording to court documents, beginning in at least July 2016 and continuing through at least May 2023, Yu ordered biochemical products from MilliporeSigma, a subsidiary of multinational science and technology company Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, with help from Mu\u00f1oz, a MilliporeSigma salesperson, by falsely representing that Yu was affiliated with a biology research lab at a large Florida university. This fictitious affiliation led MilliporeSigma to provide Yu over $4.9\u00a0million worth of discounts and other benefits, such as free overnight shipping, not available to the public. Yu gave Mu\u00f1oz thousands of dollars in gift cards for facilitating these fraudulent discounted orders. When the products arrived at the university stockroom, a stockroom employee diverted the products to Yu, who repackaged them and shipped them to China. To avoid scrutiny, Yu made false statements about the value and contents of these shipments in export documents.\n\nThis scheme continued until MilliporeSigma compliance personnel identified certain orders as suspicious, prompting the company to retain outside counsel who voluntarily disclosed the misconduct to the Department of Justice\u2019s National Security Division only a week later. MilliporeSigma made the disclosure well before its counsel had completed their investigation and understood the full nature and extent of the scheme. MilliporeSigma offered exceptional cooperation to the prosecution team, including by proactively identifying and producing documents to the Department that established probable cause to search residences and electronic devices of culpable individuals. MilliporeSigma\u2019s cooperation allowed investigators to quickly identify the individuals responsible for the scheme, including Yu, Mu\u00f1oz, and Thyng, and secure their felony guilty pleas.\n\nThe Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, and Homeland Security Investigations investigated the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel J. Marcet for the Middle District of Florida and Trial Attorney Garrett Coyle of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting the cases.",

            "article_text": "ST. PAUL, Minn. \u2013 A Hopkins man has been sentenced to life in prison for distributing controlled substances, including fentanyl, which resulted in the deaths of eleven people and caused serious bodily injury to four people, announced U.S. Attorney Andrew M. Luger.\n\n\u201cEleven lives lost. Families, friends, and communities forever changed by the devastation brought on by Aaron Broussard\u2019s deadly fentanyl. Although the trauma felt by the victims can never be undone and the true cost can never be calculated, Mr. Broussard will now spend the remainder of his life behind bars,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Andrew M. Luger.\n\n\u201cLet today\u2019s sentencing serve as a wakeup call to the drug traffickers pushing fentanyl in and around our communities,\u201d Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Omaha Division Special Agent in Charge Justin C. King said. \u201cA mere two milligrams of fentanyl, equivalent in size to a few grains of salt, is enough to potentially kill a person. The threat of fentanyl is real, and the traffickers pushing this deadly substance will be held accountable for the lives they\u2019ve taken, the families they\u2019ve hurt and the communities they\u2019ve devastated.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s sentencing of Aaron Broussard sends a clear message in how critical a role the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and its law enforcement partners play in protecting American consumers from illegal narcotics being shipped via the U.S. Mail. U.S. Postal Inspectors are committed to continuing our work to dismantle drug trafficking operations to keep USPS customers and employees safe from greedy drug traffickers who favor profit over human lives,\u201d stated Inspector in Charge Ruth M. Mendon\u00e7a of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Denver Division.\u201d\n\nAccording to the evidence presented at trial, from 2014 through December 6, 2016, Aaron Rhy Broussard, 31, obtained controlled substances, including fentanyl, from China-based drug suppliers. Broussard conspired with his China-based suppliers to smuggle what would prove to be deadly drugs into the country. Broussard marketed these drugs for sale on his website, PlantFoodUSA.net, under the guise of selling plant food. He then used the United States mail and a United States Postal Service \u201cClick-N-Ship\u201d account to send out packages of deadly drugs around the country.\n\nOn March 12, 2016, Broussard placed a drug order for 100 grams of 4-FA, a controlled substance analogue, which was shipped from China. The package actually contained 100 grams of 99% pure fentanyl. Although Broussard had experienced a similar mix-up in August 2015 and was repeatedly told to test his drugs, he did not do so. Between March 31 and April 27, 2016, Broussard sent his branded packages containing fentanyl to more than a dozen customers throughout the United States. The customers had ordered and were expecting to receive an amphetamine analogue, similar to Adderall. They were not opiate users and had no tolerance for the deadly fentanyl Broussard sent them. After ingesting the fentanyl, believing it was Adderall, eleven of the customers died from a fentanyl overdose, and at least four customers suffered serious bodily injury.\n\nBroussard continued distributing his deadly packages despite hearing about adverse reactions. Even after he learned that several customers had been hospitalized and nearly died, Broussard never warned his customers not to take the deadly drugs. Broussard did reach out to his suppliers in China to request a discount on his next drug delivery.\n\nOn March 31, 2022, following a 10-day jury trial before Senior U.S. District Judge Susan Richard Nelson, Broussard was convicted on 17 counts, including conspiracy, importation of fentanyl, possession with intent to distribute fentanyl, distribution of fentanyl resulting in death, distribution of fentanyl resulting in serious bodily injury, and possession with intent to distribute controlled substance analogues.\n\nDuring the sentencing hearing, Senior U.S. District Judge Susan Richard Nelson lauded the bravery shown by victims and their families in providing their victim impact statements to the Court. In imposing the life sentence, Judge Nelson told Broussard, \u201cYour disregard for human life is terrifying.\u201d\n\nThis case is the result of an investigation conducted by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, in partnership with Homeland Security Investigations, Customs and Border Protection, the University of Minnesota Police Department, the Peoria Heights (Illinois) Police Department, the Dallas (Texas) Police Department, the Broome County (New York) Sheriff\u2019s Office, the Volusia County (Florida) Sheriff\u2019s Office, the Orange County (California) Sheriff\u2019s Office, Garrard County (Kentucky) Sheriff\u2019s Office, Hazel Green (Wisconsin) Police Department, and the Atlanta (Georgia) Police Department.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorneys Thomas M. Hollenhorst and Melinda A. Williams prosecuted the case.",

            "article_text": "CHICAGO \u2014 John R. Lausch, Jr., United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, today provided an update on federal prosecutions and strategies to combat violent crime in Chicago and the surrounding area.\n\nThe centerpiece of the federal fight against violent crime continues to be the revitalizedProject Safe Neighborhoods, as well asProject Guardian, which focuses on firearms prosecutions, andOperation Legend, the Department of Justice\u2019s recent initiative to address violent crime in several U.S. cities, including Chicago, which has been facing a significant increase in homicides and shootings.\u00a0 These initiatives have enabled the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Chicago to sustain significant levels of federal prosecutions of violent offenders despite the recent unprecedented challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cDespite a global health crisis that continues to impact the criminal justice system, our office has maintained or exceeded its recent levels of prosecutions of violent criminals, including trigger-pullers, carjackers, and those who illegally use and possess firearms,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Lausch.\u00a0 \u201cWe are using every available federal law enforcement tool to reduce violent crime in Chicago and hold violent offenders accountable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe number one priority of government is to keep its citizens safe,\u201d said Attorney General William P. Barr. \u00a0\u201cViolating federal firearms laws is a serious crime and offenders face serious consequences.\u00a0 The Department of Justice is committed to investigating and prosecuting individuals who illegally buy, sell, use, or possess firearms.\u201d\n\nAccording to preliminary data for the 2020 Fiscal Year, which ended Sept. 30, 2020, 262 defendants were charged with a firearm offense in the Northern District of Illinois.\u00a0 This number is higher than 14 of the previous 15 years, with the lone exception being 2019, which had 8% more firearm defendants.\u00a0 The number of firearm defendants in FY20 was 33% higher than 2018, and 48% higher than 2017, according to preliminary data.\u00a0 These increases were particularly significant considering that, prior to 2019, the 2018 and 2017 fiscal years stood as the two highest years of federal firearm defendants in more than a decade.\n\nThe sustained focus on federal prosecution of firearm offenses in the Northern District of Illinois was enhanced by Operation Legend, which launched in Chicago in July.\u00a0 Under Operation Legend, approximately 176 defendants have been charged with federal offenses impacting violent crime in Chicago, including 130 charged with firearms-related offenses, 40 charged with narcotics-related offenses, and 6 charged with other violent crimes.\u00a0 Approximately1,057 defendants have been charged throughout the countryunder Operation Legend, including 568 with firearms-related offenses, 411 with narcotics-related offenses, and 78 with other violent crimes.\n\n\u201cThe number of violent crimes in Chicago remains stubbornly high, including homicides, shootings, and carjackings, and we have seen troubling increases in these areas in 2020,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Lausch.\u00a0 \u201cOur goal as federal prosecutors is not simply to bring more cases against more defendants, but rather to reduce violent crime, and one way to do that is by continuing to bring quality, impactful cases.\u00a0 As federal prosecutors, we endeavor to disrupt violent crime by seeking pre-trial detention for defendants who pose a danger to the community, employing federal resources to enhance law enforcement\u2019s efforts to build strong cases, and pursuing appropriate sentences in federal prison to deter dangerous individuals from continuing to wreak havoc in our neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nNationally, the Department of Justiceannouncedlast\u00a0week that more than 14,200 defendants were charged in federal courts across the country with firearms-related crimes during Fiscal Year 2020.\n\n\u201cReducing gun violence requires a coordinated effort, and we could not have charged more than 14,000 individuals with firearms-related crimes without the hard work of the dedicated law enforcement professionals at the\u00a0U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF),\u00a0our U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices across the country, and especially all of our state and local law enforcement partners,\u201d said Attorney General Barr.\n\nThrough enforcement actions, prosecutions, and community partnerships, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office works to reduce violent crime and make neighborhoods safer.\n\nEnforcement Actions and Prosecution Activity\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office works closely with U.S. law enforcement agencies, including ATF, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), Postal Inspection Service (USPIS), Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI), and U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) to investigate and prosecute a variety of violent crimes.\u00a0 State and local partners in this effort include the Chicago Police Department (CPD), Illinois State Police (ISP), Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC), Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office, Rockford Police Department, and other local departments throughout northern Illinois.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office\u2019sGun Crimes Prosecution Teamcontinues to enhance the prosecution of illegal firearm possession in certain police districts in Chicago. \u00a0Working collaboratively with federal and local law enforcement, the team focuses on charging Chicago\u2019s most dangerous criminals quickly after arrest, endeavoring to disrupt the cycle\u00a0of violence in the\u00a0neighborhoods\u00a0most in need.\n\n\u201cOur Gun Crimes Prosecution Team has had tremendous success investigating and prosecuting firearms cases from those Chicago neighborhoods suffering from the most violent crimes,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Lausch.\u00a0 \u201cOur partnerships with CPD and other state and local law enforcement have never been better.\u201d\n\nFirearm and violent crime investigations in Chicago have also been bolstered by an important tool from ATF: the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network (NIBIN).\u00a0 NIBIN is the only national network that allows for the capture and comparison of ballistic evidence to aid in solving and preventing violent crimes involving firearms. \u00a0NIBIN is a proven investigative and intelligence tool that can link firearms from multiple crime scenes, allowing law enforcement to quickly disrupt shooting cycles.\u00a0 Federal, state and local law enforcement in Chicago have used NIBIN extensively to help solve violent crimes and prosecute trigger-pullers and other gun offenders.\n\nFollowing up on the activities our office reported inOctober of last year, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office remains active in fighting violent crime through various enforcement actions, prosecutions, and sentencings, as illustrated below:\n\nGang-Related Prosecutions\n\n\u201cCombating the unacceptable level of gang violence in Chicago has been and will continue to be a top priority in our office,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Lausch.\n\nFirearm Trafficking and Firearm Theft Prosecutions\n\n\u201cStraw purchasers and firearms traffickers enable unlawful possession of guns and the violence that may follow,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Lausch.\u00a0 \u201cWe will continue to work with our law enforcement partners, including our colleagues in the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Indiana, to hold accountable those who engage in illicit firearm transactions.\u201d\n\nCarjacking and Robbery Prosecutions\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office works closely with federal, state, and local law enforcement to prosecute violent crimes, such as carjacking, that violate federal law,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Lausch.\n\nIllegal Possession of Firearms Prosecutions\n\n\u201cIf you are a felon and thinking about picking up a gun in Chicago, you should expect to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, and face the possibility of going to federal prison for a long time,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Lausch.\n\nOpioid Prosecutions\n\nOpioids are a class of highly addictive drugs that includes heroin, fentanyl, and prescription painkillers such as oxycodone and hydrocodone.\u00a0 Public safety is being threatened by unprecedented levels of opioid misuse, addiction, and overdose.\u00a0 The Department of Justice is committed to using every available tool to enforce federal drug laws and combat the opioid epidemic.\n\nIn the Northern District of Illinois, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office has deployed a strategy of aggressive investigations and prosecutions of those who are most responsible for this epidemic.\u00a0 This includes prosecuting the leaders of traditional drug trafficking organizations, as well as rogue healthcare providers, pharmacists, pharmacist technicians, and others who contribute to the supply and overuse of opioids.\n\n\u201cThe current opioid epidemic is the deadliest drug crisis in American history,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Lausch.\u00a0 \"We are actively attacking this crisis from all investigative and prosecutorial angles.\u201d\n\nOther Significant Drug Trafficking Prosecutions\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office targets traffickers who bring illegal drugs into Illinois from other states or countries, with a focus on organizations or individuals who use guns, violence and threats of violence to protect and promote their illegal businesses.\u00a0 The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office works directly with the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office to ensure that individuals trafficking drugs are charged with appropriate offenses in either federal or state court.\n\nCommunity Partnerships\n\nThe revitalized PSN program continues to invest resources in violence-prevention initiatives.\u00a0 Members of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office have participated in offender notification meetings and youth outreach forums.\u00a0 Even during the current COVID-19 pandemic, these meetings and forums are still being held, including in a virtual environment, to maintain the outreach to former offenders.\n\nOffender notification meetings provide an opportunity for individuals who have been convicted of a state or federal offense to make an informed choice not to engage in further criminal activity.\u00a0 Researchers at Arizona State University found thatthe forums have a positive influence on the offenders\u2019 perception of policeand help create an understanding that criminal activity results in a higher risk to return to prison.\u00a0 Researchers at Yale University found that ex-offenders who attend an offender notification meeting in Chicago are30% less likely to commit a new offensethan those who did not attend a meeting.\n\nThe quarterly youth forums assist children aged 13-17 to identify a path other than gang membership.\u00a0 The youth forums are conducted in partnership with CPD, the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center, and the University of Chicago Crime Lab, which tracks the progress of the children to assess results.",

(Skyworks) in Massachusetts.\u00a0 The stolen trade secrets alleged in the indictment belong to Avago and Skyworks.\n\nAvago is a designer, developer and global supplier of FBAR technology, which is a specific type of radio frequency (RF) filter.\u00a0 While Zhang was employed there, Skyworks also designed and developed FBAR technology.\u00a0 FBAR technology is primarily used in mobile devices like cellular telephones, tablets, and GPS devices.\u00a0 FBAR technology filters incoming and outgoing wireless signals so that a user only receives and transmits the specific communications intended by the user.\u00a0 Apart from consumer applications, FBAR technology has numerous applications for a variety of military and defense communications technologies.\n\nAccording to the indictment, in 2006 and 2007, Pang, Zhang, and other co-conspirators prepared a business plan and began soliciting PRC universities and others, seeking opportunities to start manufacturing FBAR technology in China.\u00a0 Through efforts outlined in the indictment, Pang, Zhang, and others established relationships with officials from Tianjin University.\u00a0 Tianjin University is a leading PRC Ministry of Education University located in Tianjin, PRC, and one of the oldest universities in China.\n\nAs set forth in the indictment, in 2008, officials from the Tianjin University flew to San Jose, California, to meet with Pang, Zhang, and other co-conspirators.\u00a0 Shortly thereafter, Tianjin University agreed to support\u00a0 Pang, Zhang, and others in establishing an FBAR fabrication facility in China.\u00a0 Pang and Zhang continued to work for Avago and Skyworks in close coordination with Tianjin University.\u00a0 In mid-2009, both Pang and Zhang simultaneously resigned from the U.S. companies and accepted positions as full professors at Tianjin University.\u00a0 Tianjin University later formed a joint venture with Pang, Zhang, and others under the company name ROFS Microsystem, intending to mass produce FBARs.\n\nThe indictment alleges that Pang, Zhang, and other co-conspirators stole recipes, source code, specifications, presentations, design layouts, and other documents marked as confidential and proprietary from the victim companies and shared the information with one another and with individuals working for Tianjin University.\n\nAccording to the indictment, the stolen trade secrets enabled Tianjin University to construct and equip a state-of-the-art FBAR fabrication facility, to open ROFS Microsystems, a joint venture located in PRC state-sponsored Tianjin Economic Development Area (TEDA), and to obtain contracts for providing FBARs to commercial and military entities.\n\nUnited States Attorney Melinda Haag stated, \u201cAs this case demonstrates, sensitive technology developed by U.S. companies in Silicon Valley and throughout California continues to be vulnerable to coordinated and complex efforts sponsored by foreign governments to steal that technology. Combating economic espionage and trade secret theft remains one of the top priorities of this Office.\u201d\n\nFBI San Francisco Special Agent-in-Charge David Johnson stated, \u201cThe conduct alleged in this superseding indictment reveals a methodical and relentless effort by foreign interests to obtain and exploit sensitive and valuable U.S. technology through the use of individuals operating within the United States.\u00a0 Complex foreign-government sponsored schemes, such as the activity identified here, inflict irreversible damage to the economy of the United States and undercut our national security.\u00a0 The FBI is committed to rooting out industrial espionage that puts U.S. companies at a disadvantage in the global market.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to the charges in the indictment, the defendants leveraged their access to and knowledge of sensitive U.S. technologies to illegally obtain and share U.S. trade secrets with the PRC for economic advantage,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Carlin.\u00a0 \u201cEconomic espionage imposes great costs on American businesses, weakens the global marketplace and ultimately harms U.S. interests worldwide.\u00a0 The National Security Division will continue to relentlessly identify, pursue and prosecute offenders wherever the evidence leads.\u00a0 I would like to thank all the agents, analysts and prosecutors who are responsible for this indictment.\u201d\n\nThe six indicted defendants include:\n\nThe maximum statutory penalty for each of the charges alleged in the Superseding Indictment is as follows:\n\nThe defendant was arrested on May 16, 2015, upon landing at the Los Angeles International Airport on a flight from the PRC. He made his initial appearance yesterday afternoon in Los Angeles before The Honorable Alicia G. Rosenberg, United States Magistrate Judge, who ordered the defendant transported in custody to San Jose for further proceedings. His next scheduled appearance will be before The Honorable Edward J. Davila, United States District Judge, at a date to be determined.\n\nThe case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Matthew Parrella and David Callaway of the Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property Unit of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in San Francisco, in consultation with the Counterespionage Section of the U.S. Department of Justice in Washington, D.C.\u00a0 The investigation is being conducted by the Palo Alto Resident Agency/San Francisco Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nPlease note, an indictment contains only allegations and, as in all cases, the defendants must be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.",

            "article_text": "SAN JOSE \u2013 Hao Zhang was sentenced yesterday to eighteen months in prison and ordered to pay $476,835 in restitution following his conviction at trial on charges of economic espionage, theft of trade secrets, and conspiring to commit both offenses, announced United States Attorney David L. Anderson and Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent in Charge John F. Bennett\n\n\u201cI am gratified by a sentence that recognizes the seriousness of the offense,\u201d said U.S. Attorney David L. Anderson for the Northern District of California. \u00a0\u201cCommand-and-control countries cannot match the innovation of a free nation, and inevitably resort to theft. \u00a0We will protect Silicon Valley. \u00a0We will protect our intellectual property.\u201d\n\n\u201cHao Zhang committed these acts to benefit himself, his co-conspirators, and the government of China. This is not competition \u2013 this is economic espionage, theft, and conspiracy,\u201d said FBI Special Agent in Charge Bennett. \u201cThe FBI will not allow American research and development to be stolen. We encourage companies to come to us both proactively and when suspicious activity is observed so that we can work together to protect American businesses and ensure our national economic security.\u201d\n\nEvidence admitted during the bench trial demonstrated that, from 2010 to 2015, Zhang conspired to and did steal trade secrets relating to Surface Acoustic Wave (\u201cSAW\u201d) and Bulk Acoustic Wave (\u201cBAW\u201d) filters, including Film Bulk Acoustic Resonators (\u201cFBAR\u201d), one type of BAW filter. These filters are commonly used as radio frequency (\u201cRF\u201d) filters for mobile phones and other devices for consumer and military applications. Zhang and his co-conspirator Wei Pang stole the trade secrets from two companies: Avago, a designer, developer, and global supplier of a broad range of analog, digital, mixed signal and optoelectronics components and subsystems with a focus in semiconductor design and processing, headquartered in San Jose, California, and Singapore; and Skyworks, an innovator of high performance analog semiconductors headquartered in Woburn, Massachusetts. \u00a0U.S. District Judge Edward J. Davila found that Zhang committed economic espionage because he intended to start a new business in China using the stolen information and knew that the business would benefit instrumentalities of the People\u2019s Republic of China, including Tianjin University (\u201cTJU\u201d).\n\nEvidence introduced at trial further showed that, by October 2006, Zhang and his co-conspirators were formulating the plan to start a business in China to compete with Avago and Skyworks. \u00a0In 2006, Zhang had graduated with a Ph.D. from the University of Southern California and taken a job at Skyworks while co-conspirator Wei Pang started working at Avago. \u00a0Zhang and Pang illicitly shared trade secrets with each other and with co-conspirators in China while they worked for the U.S. companies. \u00a0In 2009, Zhang and Pang obtained professorships at TJU based on their academic and professional experience and their commitment to start a Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (\u201cMEMS\u201d) lab at the university. TJU was aware of the trade secrets the defendants brought. With guidance from TJU, the defendants filed Chinese patent requests and created a shell company in the Cayman Islands they called Novana. Novana and a TJU subsidiary called MNMT created the new company, ROFS, as a joint venture to manufacture product realized from use of the trade secrets. Along the way, Zhang also obtained U.S. patents in his own name using trade secret information he knew was stolen from Avago.\n\nZhang, 41, of China, was charged in a superseding indictment by a federal grand jury on April 1, 2015.\n\nThe sentence was handed down by The Honorable Edward J. Davila, U.S. District Court Judge, following a four-day bench trial on one count of conspiracy to commit economic espionage, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1831(a)(5), one count of conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1832(a)(5), twelve counts of economic espionage and aid and abetting, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1831(a)(1)-(3) and 2, and twelve counts of theft of trade secrets and aiding and abetting, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1832(a)(1)-(3) and 2. \u00a0Judge Davila also sentenced the defendant to a three year period of supervised release and ordered him to pay restitution to Avago and Skyworks. \u00a0Zhang consented to the court-ordered forfeiture of the U.S. patents obtained with stolen Avago technology. The defendant will begin serving the sentence on October 22, 2020.\n\nMichelle J. Kane and Susan Knight are the Assistant U.S. Attorneys who are prosecuting the case with the assistance of Jessica Rodriguez Gonzalez, Susan Kreider, and Laurie Worthen. \u00a0The prosecution is the result of an investigation by the FBI.",

            "article_text": "The former Chair of Harvard University\u2019s Chemistry and Chemical Biology Department was convicted by a federal jury today in connection with lying to federal authorities about his affiliation with the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s Thousand Talents Program and the Wuhan University of Technology (WUT) in Wuhan, China, as well as failing to report income he received from WUT.\n\nDr. Charles Lieber, 62, was convicted following a six-day jury trial of two counts of making false statements to federal authorities, two counts of making and subscribing a false income tax return and two counts of failing to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts (FBAR) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). U.S. Senior District Court Judge Rya W. Zobel will sentence Lieber at a later date that has not yet been scheduled. Lieber was indicted in June 2020 and was subsequently charged in a superseding indictment in July 2020.\n\nLieber served as the Principal Investigator of the Lieber Research Group at Harvard University, which received more than $15 million in federal research grants between 2008 and 2019. Unbeknownst to his employer, Harvard University, Lieber became a \u201cStrategic Scientist\u201d at WUT and, later, a contractual participant in China\u2019s Thousand Talents Plan from at least 2012 through 2015. China\u2019s Thousand Talents Plan is one of the most prominent talent recruitment plans designed to attract, recruit and cultivate high-level scientific talent in furtherance of China\u2019s scientific development, economic prosperity and national security.\n\nUnder the terms of Lieber\u2019s three-year Thousand Talents contract, WUT paid Lieber a salary of up to $50,000 per month, living expenses of up to $150,000 and awarded him more than $1.5 million to establish a research lab at WUT. In 2018 and 2019, Lieber lied to federal authorities about his involvement in the Thousand Talents Plan and his affiliation with WUT.\n\nIn tax years 2013 and 2014, Lieber earned income from WUT in the form of salary and other payments made to him pursuant to the Strategic Scientist and Thousand Talents Contracts, which he did not disclose to the IRS on his federal income tax returns. Lieber, together with WUT officials, opened a bank account at a Chinese bank during a trip to Wuhan in 2012. Thereafter, between at least 2013 and 2015, WUT periodically deposited portions of Lieber\u2019s salary into that account. U.S. taxpayers are required to report the existence of any foreign bank account that holds more than $10,000 at any time during a given year by the filing an FBAR with the IRS. Lieber failed to file FBARs for the years 2014 and 2015.\n\nThe charge of making false statements provides for a sentence of up to five years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000. The charge of making and subscribing false income tax returns provides for a sentence of up to three years in prison, one year of supervised release and a $100,000 fine. The charge of failing to file an FBAR provides for a sentence of up to five years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nActing U.S. Attorney Mendell; National Security AAG Olsen; FBI SAC Bonavolonta; DCIS SAC Hegarty; NCIS SAC Wiest; HHS OIG SAC Coyne; and IRS CI SAC Simpson made this announcement. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason Casey of Mendell\u2019s National Security Unit and Assistant U.S. Attorney James R. Drabick of Mendell\u2019s Securities, Financial & Cyber Fraud Unit are prosecuting the case.",

            "article_text": "In three separate cases in the U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices for the Eastern District of New York and the District of New Jersey, the Justice Department has charged 13 individuals, including members of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) security and intelligence apparatus and their agents, for alleged efforts to unlawfully exert influence in the United States for the benefit of the government of the PRC.\n\nIn the Eastern District of New York, an eight-count indictment was unsealed on Oct. 20 charging seven PRC nationals \u2013 two of whom were arrested on Oct. 20 in New York \u2013 with participating in a scheme to cause the forced repatriation of a PRC national residing in the United States. The defendants are accused of conducting surveillance of and engaging in a campaign to harass and coerce a U.S. resident to return to the PRC as part of an international extralegal repatriation effort known as \u201cOperation Fox Hunt.\u201d\n\nA criminal complaint was unsealed today in federal court in Brooklyn charging two People\u2019s PRC intelligence officers with attempting to obstruct a criminal prosecution in the Eastern District of New York. The defendants remain at large.\n\nIn the District of New Jersey, an indictment was unsealed today charging four Chinese nationals, including three Ministry of State Security (MSS) intelligence officers, in connection with a long-running intelligence campaign targeting individuals in the United States to act as agents of the PRC.\n\n\u201cAs these cases demonstrate, the government of China sought to interfere with the rights and freedoms of individuals in the United States and to undermine our judicial system that protects those rights. They did not succeed,\u201d said U.S. Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \u201cThe Justice Department will not tolerate attempts by any foreign power to undermine the Rule of Law upon which our democracy is based. We will continue to fiercely protect the rights guaranteed to everyone in our country. And we will defend the integrity of our institutions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe actions announced today take place against a backdrop of malign activity from the government of the People\u2019s Republic of China that includes espionage, attempts to disrupt our justice system, harassment of individuals, and ongoing efforts to steal sensitive U.S. technology,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco. \u201cThe men and women of the Department of Justice will continue to defend the United States, our institutions, and our people from foreign threats that violate the law \u2014 no matter what form they take.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese indictments of PRC intelligence officers and government officials \u2013 for trying to obstruct a U.S. trial of a Chinese company, masquerading as university professors to steal sensitive information, and trying to strong-arm a victim into returning to China \u2013 again expose the PRC\u2019s outrageous behavior within our own borders,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \u201cThe FBI, working with our partners and allies, will continue to throw the full weight of our counterintelligence and law enforcement authorities into stopping the Chinese government\u2019s crimes against our businesses, universities, and Chinese-American communities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese cases highlight the threat the PRC government poses to our institutions and the rights of people in the United States,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division. \u201cWe will not tolerate these brazen operations: the harassment and attempted repatriation by force of individuals living in the U.S.; the effort to corrupt our judicial system; and the attempt to recruit agents for the PRC under the cover of a front academic organization. Countering such threats is a cornerstone of the mission of the National Security Division.\u201d\n\nUnited States v. Quanzhong An, et al.,Eastern District of New York\n\nAneight-count indictmentwas unsealed on Oct. 20 in Brooklyn charging a total of seven nationals of the PRC \u2013 Quanzhong An, 55, of Roslyn, New York; Guangyang An, 34, of Roslyn, New York; Tian Peng, 38, of the PRC; Chenghua Chen of the PRC; Chunde Ming of the PRC; Xuexin Hou, 52, of the PRC; and Weidong Yuan, 55, of the PRC \u2013 with participating in a scheme to cause the forced repatriation of a PRC national residing in the United States. The lead defendant, Quanzhong An, allegedly acted at the direction and under the control of various officials with the PRC\u2019s government\u2019s Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection (Provincial Commission) \u2013 including Peng, Chen, Ming, and Hou \u2013 to conduct surveillance of and engage in a campaign to harass and coerce a U.S. resident to return to the PRC as part of an international extralegal repatriation effort known as \u201cOperation Fox Hunt.\u201d\n\nQuanzhong An and Guangyang An were arrested on Thursday and were arraigned that afternoon before U.S. Magistrate Judge Ramon E. Reyes Jr. The remaining defendants remain at large.\n\n\u201cAs alleged, the defendants engaged in a unilateral and uncoordinated law enforcement action on U.S. soil on behalf of the government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, in an effort to cause the forced repatriation of a U.S. resident to China,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York. \u201cThe United States will firmly counter such outrageous violations of national sovereignty and prosecute individuals who act as illegal agents of foreign states.\u201d\n\nAs alleged in the indictment, the defendants participated in an international campaign to threaten and intimidate John Doe-1, a resident of United States, and his family to force John Doe-1 to return to the PRC. These efforts were part of \u201cOperation Fox Hunt,\u201d an initiative by the PRC\u2019s Ministry of Public Security to locate and repatriate alleged fugitives who flee to foreign countries, including the United States. The PRC government has targeted these alleged fugitives and their families to compel cooperation with the PRC government and self-repatriation to the PRC. The PRC government has taken such law enforcement actions on U.S. soil in a unilateral manner without approval, of or coordination with the U.S. government.\n\nQuanzhong An, who is a businessman operating in Queens, New York, and the majority shareholder of a hotel in Flushing, acted as the primary U.S.-based liaison for the Provincial Commission\u2019s targeting of John Doe-1 and his family members, including his son, John Doe-2, both in the United States and in the PRC. As part of the scheme, various PRC-based conspirators forced a relative in the PRC (John Doe-3) to travel from the PRC to the United States in September 2018 to meet with John Doe-2 and convey threats that were intended to coerce John Doe-1\u2019s return to the PRC. Yuan \u2013 John Doe-3\u2019s superior at the PRC\u2019s State Administration of Taxation \u2013 escorted John Doe-3 from the PRC to the United States, under the guise of a visit with a tour group.\n\nPRC-based defendants and coconspirators also engaged in a pattern of harassment targeting John Doe-1\u2019s family members. In November 2017, Hou wrote John Doe-2 warning him that \u201ccoming back and turning yourself in is the only way out.\u201d Hou further threatened that \u201cavoidance and wishful thinking will only result in severe legal punishments.\u201d The PRC government also harassed John Doe-1 and John Doe-2 through the filing of a lawsuit in New York State court, alleging that John Doe-1 had stolen funds from his former PRC based employer and that John Doe-2 had knowledge of and benefitted from his father\u2019s scheme.\n\nIn a series of recorded meetings in 2020, 2021, and 2022, Quanzhong An repeatedly met with John Doe-2 and attempted to persuade John Doe-2 to cause the return of John Doe-1 to the PRC. In these meetings, Quanzhong An acknowledged that he is a member of the Standing Committee of the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), which enforces the rules and regulations of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) abroad. At various times, he attributed his instructions to Chen, Ming, and Peng and acknowledged that the Fox Hunt operation was motivated by the PRC government\u2019s need to \u201csave their faces\u201d and repatriate as many fugitives as possible.\n\nQuanzhong An admitted that he was acting as an agent of the Provincial Commission to increase his standing in the PRC. During his meetings with John Doe-2, Quanzhong An repeatedly transmitted threats on behalf of the PRC government. If John Doe-1 did not return, the PRC government would \u201ckeep pestering you, [and] make your daily life uncomfortable,\u201d in addition to actions to \u201ctarget and monitor\u201d John Doe-1\u2019s relatives in the PRC. On another occasion, he stated that \u201cthey will definitely find new ways to bother you\u201d and \u201cit is definitely true that all of your relatives will be involved.\u201d\n\nAs set forth in the detention memorandum, Quanzhong An met with John Doe-2 again on Sept. 29, 2022. During this meeting, Quanzhong An pressed for John Doe-1 to execute an agreement to return to the PRC in advance of the CCP\u2019s 20th National Congress, which began on Oct. 16, 2022. As part of such agreement, Quanzhong An sought a written confession from John Doe-1, which would be submitted directly to the PRC government.\n\nThe charges in the indictment are allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. If convicted of acting as agents of the PRC, Quanzhong An faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. The money laundering conspiracy charge against Quanzhong An and Guangyang An carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. The remaining charges, including conspiring to act as agents of the PRC and conspiring to commit interstate and international stalking, carry a maximum sentence of five years in prison.\n\nThe government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Alexander A. Solomon, Sara K. Winik, and Antoinette N. Rangel and Trial Attorney Scott A. Claffee of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section. Assistant U.S. Attorney Brian Morris of the Office\u2019s Asset Recovery Section is handling forfeiture matters.\n\nUnited States v. Dong He, et al.,Eastern District of New York\n\nAcriminal complaintwas unsealed today in federal court in Brooklyn charging two People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) intelligence officers with attempting to obstruct a criminal prosecution in the Eastern District of New York. The defendants remain at large.\n\nAccording to court documents, Dong He, aka Guochun He and aka Jacky He, and Zheng Wang, aka Zen Wang, allegedly orchestrated a scheme to steal files and other information from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of New York related to the ongoing federal criminal investigation and prosecution of a global telecommunications company (Company-1) based in the PRC, including by paying a $41,000 Bitcoin bribe to a U.S. government employee who the defendants believed had been recruited to work for the PRC, but who in fact was a double agent working on behalf of the FBI.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s complaint underscores the unrelenting efforts of the PRC government to undermine the rule of law,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York. \u201cAs alleged, the case involves an effort by PRC intelligence officers to obstruct an ongoing criminal prosecution by making bribes to obtain files from this Office and sharing them with a global telecommunications company that is a charged defendant in an ongoing prosecution. We will always act decisively to counteract criminal acts that target our system of justice.\u201d\n\nDong He and Zheng Wang are charged with attempting to obstruct a criminal prosecution of Company-1 in federal district court in the Eastern District of New York. Defendant He also is charged with money laundering based upon a bribe payment of $41,000 in Bitcoin made in furtherance of the scheme.\n\nAccording to the complaint, the defendants are PRC intelligence officers conducting foreign intelligence operations targeting the United States, on behalf of the PRC government and for the benefit of Company-1. Starting in 2019, they directed an employee at a U.S. government law enforcement agency (GE-1), whom they believed they had recruited as an asset, to steal confidential information about the criminal prosecution of Company-1 in order to interfere with that prosecution. In actuality, GE-1 was working as a double agent on behalf of the FBI.\n\nIn September 2021, the defendants tasked GE-1 with reporting about meetings that GE-1 was purportedly having with prosecutors in Brooklyn at the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of New York. In written communications, the defendants said they were particularly interested in knowing which Company-1 employees had been interviewed by the government and in obtaining a description of the prosecutors\u2019 evidence, witness list and trial strategy.\n\nIn October 2021, GE-1 used an encrypted messaging program to send the defendants a single page from a purported internal strategy memorandum from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of New York regarding the Company-1 case. The document appeared to be classified as \u201cSECRET\u201d and to discuss a plan to charge and arrest two current Company-1 employees living in the PRC. Dong He responded that the document was \u201cexactly what I am waiting for\u201d and that he was \u201cwaiting for the feedback from some guys\u201d about whether there were any questions about the document. Dong He then paid GE-1 approximately $41,000 in Bitcoin for stealing that document.\n\nGE-1 also asked the defendants for any feedback about the \u201cSECRET\u201d document. In November 2021, Dong He stated that \u201c[Company-1] didn\u2019t give me specifically feedback now yet, but they are obviously interested in it, and my boss and they need further information.\u201d Dong He further told GE-1 that \u201c[Company-1] obviously will be interested\u201d in GE-1 stealing another part of the strategy memorandum, and \u201cmaybe will offer more\u201d for that information. In December 2021, in response to a further request by GE-1 for feedback or guidance from Company-1 about \u201cwhat they want me to get,\u201d Dong He explained that \u201cthey didn\u2019t give me any positive feedback yet and demanded to communicate with you directly.\u201d Dong He said that he refused Company-1\u2019s request to speak directly to GE-1 because \u201cit\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d\n\nThe charges in the complaint are allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. If convicted, Dong He faces up to 40 years of imprisonment and Wang faces up to 20 years of imprisonment.\n\nThe government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Alexander A. Solomon and Meredith A. Arfa and Trial Attorney Scott A. Claffee of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.\n\nUnited States v. Wang Lin et al.,District of New Jersey\n\nAfederal indictmentwas unsealed today charging four Chinese nationals, including three Ministry of State Security (MSS) intelligence officers, in connection with a long-running intelligence campaign targeting individuals in the United States to act as agents of the PRC.\n\nAs alleged in the indictment, from at least 2008 to 2018, Wang Lin, 59; Bi Hongwei, age unknown; Dong Ting, aka Chelsea Dong, 40; Wang Qiang, 55, and others engaged in a wide-ranging and systematic effort to target and recruit individuals to act on behalf of the PRC in the United States with requests to provide information, materials, equipment, and assistance to the Chinese government in ways that would further China\u2019s intelligence objectives. These recruitment efforts included targeting professors at universities, a former federal law enforcement and state homeland security official, and others to act on behalf of, and as agents of, the Chinese government.\n\nAs part of the conspiracy, MSS intelligence officers Wang Lin, Dong Ting, and others used a purported academic institute at Ocean University of China \u2013 referred to as the Institute for International Studies (IIS) \u2013 as cover for their clandestine intelligence activities. Acting under cover as the purported director of the IIS, Wang Lin, in coordination with other MSS operatives operating under the guise of academics at the IIS, targeted professors at American universities and others in the United States with access to sensitive information and equipment.\n\nAccording to the indictment unsealed today, MSS intelligence officers Wang Lin, Bi, Dong, and others, acting for and on behalf of the MSS and the Chinese government, systematically targeted United States persons, including but not limited to a coconspirator who was a resident of the state of New Jersey and a second individual who was a former federal law enforcement officer and state homeland security official and a professor at an American university.\n\nAmong other things, the conspiracy targeted the second individual by inviting the individual in 2008 and 2018 on all-expenses-paid trips to China sponsored by the IIS. During those trips, Wang Lin, Dong, and others sought to recruit this individual as a human source, requesting that the individual provide sensitive fingerprint technology, information, and assistance with stopping planned protests along the 2008 Olympic Games torch route in the United States, which the conspirators expressed would be \u201cembarrassing\u201d to China. The individual also was requested to sign a contract for purported consulting services with a Chinese company whose \u201ccore value\u201d was the \u201cnational interest and national security\u201d of China, with an objective to \u201cprotect the national interest and Chinese enterprises\u2019 overseas interest[s]\u201d and to \u201cbuild sources and channels to collect security information.\u201d Recognizing Wang Lin, Dong, and others as Chinese intelligence officers, the individual refused these requests and reported them to law enforcement.\n\nThe conspiracy also targeted the coconspirator in New Jersey by tasking the coconspirator to take specific action in the United States in furtherance of the MSS\u2019 intelligence objective. Wang Qiang coordinated a meeting in 2016 between the coconspirator, Wang Lin, and Bi Hongwei in the Bahamas, at which time MSS intelligence officers Wang Lin and Bi directed the coconspirator to obtain U.S. currency and provide it to a designated individual in New Jersey. The coconspirator returned to New Jersey and did as Wang\u00a0Lin and BI instructed. Wang Qiang then visited the coconspirator in New\u00a0Jersey, at which time Wang Qiang and the coconspirator discussed in detail their and others\u2019 activities taken on behalf of the Chinese government in the United States.\n\nLin, Bi, Dong and Qiang, all are nationals and residents of the People\u2019s Republic of China. They each are charged in the indictment with conspiracy to act in the United States as agents of a foreign government, namely, the People\u2019s Republic of China, without prior notification to the Attorney General of the United States, as\u00a0required by law, and to direct such unlawful action by others in the United States. The conspiracy charge carries a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of five\u00a0years and a maximum fine of $250,000.\n\nU.S. Attorney Sellinger credited special agents of the FBI, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge James E. Dennehy in Newark, with the investigation leading to the charges.\n\nThe government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorneys J. Brendan Day, Attorney in Charge of the Trenton Branch Office, and Joyce M. Malliet, Chief of the Office\u2019s National Security Unit.\n\nThe charges in the indictment are allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.",

            "article_text": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2013 The United States Attorney\u2019s Office today unsealed a criminal complaint charging Jonathan Yet Wing Soong with smuggling and violating export control laws by allegedly secretly funneling sensitive aeronautics software to a Beijing university, announced United States Attorney Stephanie M. Hinds; Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent in Charge Sean Ragan; Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, Office of Export Enforcement (BIS), Special Agent in Charge John D. Masters; \u00a0Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) Special Agent in Charge Bryan D. Denny. \u00a0Soong made his initial appearance to face the charges in federal court earlier today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Joseph C. Spero.\n\nThe allegations against Soong, 34, of San Jose, were set out in a complaint filed May 23, 2022, and unsealed earlier today. \u00a0According to the complaint, Soong was employed by Universities Space Research Association (USRA) between April 2016 and September 2020 as a program administrator. \u00a0USRA is a nonprofit corporation contracted by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to, among other things, distribute domestically and internationally sensitive aeronautics-related software developed through the Army\u2019s Software Transfer Agreement (STA) program. \u00a0As USRA\u2019s STA program administrator, Soong was responsible for overseeing certain software license sales, conducting export compliance screening of customers, generating software licenses, and, on occasion, physically exporting software.\n\nSoong is alleged to have been trained in and been aware of export compliance rules which, among other things, restrict sales and exports to certain entities. \u00a0As relevant to this case, the complaint describes rules that restrict sales of certain technology to entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce Entity List (Entity List), a list with associated regulations that are maintained by the Department of Commerce pursuant to federal statutory and presidential directive. \u00a0The Entity List and associated regulations prohibit export without a license of certain technology with commercial and potential military applications to entities and individuals whose activities have been found to be contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interests. \u00a0The complaint alleges Soong unlawfully and without a license exported and facilitated the sale and transfer of software to an entity on the Entity List\u2014Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (BUAA), which is also known as Beihang University. \u00a0According to the complaint, Beihang University was added to the Entity List due to the University\u2019s involvement in People\u2019s Republic of China military rocket systems and unmanned air vehicle systems. \u00a0Given its inclusion on the Entity List, BUAA is prohibited from receiving certain items without a license. \u00a0The complaint alleges Soong used an intermediary in hopes that the illegal transfer would not be detected.\n\nAt issue in the case is a software package that is marketed for the development of unmanned aircraft. \u00a0The Army flight-control software packages, referred to in the complaint as CIFER, performed as a tool to allow a user to develop a dynamic model of an aircraft based on collective flight test data. \u00a0The package could be used to analyze and design aircraft control systems. \u00a0According to the complaint, in April 2017, Soong became aware that BUAA was on the Entity List and nonetheless arranged to sell and transfer the CIFER software package to BUAA. \u00a0Soong ultimately exported directly to Beihang University in July 2018. \u00a0The complaint alleges that Soong arranged to sell the CIFER software package to Beijing Rainbow Technical Development Ltd., as an intermediary for the purchase to disguise BUAA\u2019s involvement, as Soong knew that BUAA could not receive this technology without a license from the Department of Commerce. \u00a0The complaint describes how Soong arranged for the intermediary to receive the CIFER program package, and ultimately Soong arranged to have the passcodes for the CIFER software package forwarded to Beihang University with payment coming from Beijing Rainbow.\n\nA criminal complaint merely alleges that crimes have been committed. \u00a0All defendants, including Soong, are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nSoong is charged with violating International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), in violation of 50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1701\u20131707, and smuggling, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 554. \u00a0The IEEPA violation carries a statutory maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $1,000,000 fine. \u00a0The smuggling count carries a statutory maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. \u00a0In addition, as part of any sentence handed down after conviction, the court may order restitution, and up to three years of supervised release. \u00a0However, any sentence after conviction would be imposed by the court only after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553.\n\nSoong\u2019s next scheduled appearance is set for June 2, 2022, before U.S. Magistrate Judge the Honorable Laurel Beeler.\n\nAssistant United States Attorney Barbara Valliere of the United States Attorney\u2019s Office\u2019s Special Prosecutions Section is prosecuting the case with the assistance of Maddi Wachs and Kathy Tat. \u00a0The prosecution is the result of an investigation by the BIS, DCIS, and the FBI with assistance from the NASA Office of Inspector General; U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Division; the U.S. Army Counterintelligence; and the Department of Homeland Security, Homeland Security Investigations.",

Ross on Wednesday sentenced a man who fled to Asia after his arrest during a child pornography investigation to seven years in prison.\n\nDominic J. Pavia, now 42, pleaded guilty in November to one count of possession of child pornography. He admitted as part of his plea that on Dec. 10, 2010, an investigation by the Saint Louis County Police Department's Special Investigations Unit identified a computer being used to store child sexual abuse material. During an April 26, 2011, court-approved search, detectives seized computer equipment and Pavia, a law school student, was arrested. A scan revealed child pornography on the computer.\n\nPavia, who was living in University City at the time, left the country, knowing that criminal charges were a possibility, according to his plea agreement.\n\nOn March 4, 2014, detectives performed a full forensic analysis of the computer, finding 4,641 images and 1,719 videos containing child pornography. Pavia was indicted on Nov. 19, 2014.\n\nAfter leaving the U.S., Pavia traveled to China, Thailand, Cambodia and the Philippines. He was unable to renew his visa in China in the summer of 2022 and his passport was set to expire in September 2023, according to court records. He returned to the United States in January 2023.\n\nThe St. Louis County Police Department and the FBI investigated the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Dianna Collins prosecuted the case.\n\nThis case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice.

            "article_text": "CHICAGO \u2014 John R. Lausch, Jr., United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, today provided an update on federal prosecutions and strategies to combat violent crime in Chicago and the surrounding area.\n\nThe centerpiece of the Department of Justice\u2019s violent crime reduction efforts continues to beProject Safe Neighborhoods(PSN).\u00a0 PSN is an evidence-based program proven to be effective at reducing violent crime.\u00a0 Through PSN, a broad spectrum of stakeholders works together to identify the most pressing violent crime problems in the community and develops comprehensive solutions to address them.\u00a0 As part of this strategy, PSN focuses enforcement efforts on the most violent offenders and partners with locally based prevention and reentry programs for lasting reductions in crime.\n\n\u201cThe number of violent crimes in Chicago remains stubbornly high, including homicides, shootings, and carjackings, and we have seen troubling increases in these areas since the pandemic began,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Lausch.\u00a0 \u201cWe are using every available federal law enforcement tool to continue to bring quality, impactful cases that hold violent offenders accountable and reduce violent crime in Chicago.\u201d\n\nIn addition to a sustained focus on prosecutions of federal firearm offenses, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office endeavors to disrupt violent crime by seeking pre-trial detention for defendants who pose a danger to the community and pursuing appropriate prison sentences to deter dangerous individuals from continuing to wreak havoc in their communities.\u00a0 Through enforcement actions, prosecutions, and community partnerships, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office works to lower violent crime and make neighborhoods safer.\n\nEnforcement Actions and Prosecution Activity\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office works closely with U.S. law enforcement agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), Postal Inspection Service (USPIS), Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division (IRS-CI), and U.S. Marshals Service (USMS), to investigate and prosecute a variety of violent crimes.\u00a0 State and local partners in this effort include the Chicago Police Department (CPD), Illinois State Police (ISP), Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC), Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office, Rockford Police Department, and other police departments throughout northern Illinois.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office\u2019sGun Crimes Prosecution Teamcontinues to enhance the prosecution of illegal firearm possession in the most violent police districts in Chicago. \u00a0Working collaboratively with federal and local law enforcement, the team focuses on charging Chicago\u2019s most dangerous criminals quickly after arrest, endeavoring to disrupt the cycle\u00a0of violence in the\u00a0neighborhoods\u00a0most in need.\n\n\u201cOur Gun Crimes Prosecution Team works tirelessly to investigate and prosecute firearms cases from those Chicago neighborhoods suffering from the most violent crimes,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Lausch.\u00a0 \u201cOur partnerships with CPD and other state and local law enforcement have never been better.\u201d\n\nFirearm and violent crime investigations in Chicago have also been bolstered by an important tool from ATF: the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network (NIBIN).\u00a0 NIBIN is the only national network that allows for the capture and comparison of ballistic evidence to aid in solving and preventing violent crimes involving firearms. \u00a0NIBIN is a proven investigative and intelligence tool that can link firearms from multiple crime scenes, allowing law enforcement to quickly disrupt shooting cycles.\u00a0 Federal, state, and local law enforcement in Chicago have used NIBIN extensively to help solve violent crimes and prosecute trigger-pullers and other gun offenders.\n\nFollowing up on the activities our office reported inOctober of last year, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office remains active in fighting violent crime through various enforcement actions, prosecutions, and sentencings, as illustrated by the examples below:\n\n\u201cCombating the unacceptable level of gang violence in Chicago has been and will continue to be a top priority in our office,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Lausch.\n\n\u201cStraw purchasers and firearms traffickers enable unlawful possession of guns and the violence that may follow,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Lausch.\u00a0 \u201cWe will continue to work with our law enforcement partners, including our colleagues in other U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices in the Midwest and across the country, to hold accountable individuals or groups who traffic firearms into Chicago.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office works closely with federal, state, and local law enforcement officers to prosecute violent crimes, such as carjacking, that violate federal law,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Lausch.\n\n\u201cIf you are a felon and thinking about picking up a gun in Chicago, you should expect to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, and face the possibility of going to federal prison for a long time,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Lausch.\n\nOpioids are a class of highly addictive drugs that includes heroin, fentanyl, and prescription painkillers such as oxycodone and hydrocodone.\u00a0 Public safety is being threatened by unprecedented levels of opioid misuse and overdose.\u00a0 The Department of Justice is committed to using every available tool to enforce federal drug laws and combat the opioid epidemic.\u00a0 In the Northern District of Illinois, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office has deployed a strategy of aggressive investigations and prosecutions of those who are most responsible for this epidemic.\u00a0 This includes prosecuting the leaders of traditional drug trafficking organizations, as well as rogue healthcare providers, pharmacists, pharmacist technicians, and others who contribute to the misuse of opioids.\n\n\u201cThe current opioid epidemic is the deadliest drug crisis in American history,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Lausch. \u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe are actively attacking this crisis from all investigative and prosecutorial angles.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office targets traffickers who bring illegal drugs into Illinois from other states or countries, with a focus on organizations or individuals who use guns, violence and threats of violence to protect and promote their illegal businesses.\u00a0 The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office works directly with the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office to ensure that individuals trafficking drugs are charged with appropriate offenses in either federal or state court.\n\nCommunity Partnerships\n\nThe PSN program continues to invest resources in violence-prevention initiatives.\u00a0 Members of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office have participated in offender notification meetings and youth outreach forums.\u00a0 Even during the current COVID-19 pandemic, these meetings and forums are still being held, including in a virtual environment, to maintain the outreach to former offenders.\n\nOffender notification meetings provide an opportunity for individuals who have been convicted of a state or federal offense to make an informed choice not to engage in further criminal activity.\u00a0 Researchers at Arizona State University found that the forums in Chicago have a positive influence on the offenders\u2019 perception of police and help create an understanding that criminal activity results in a higher risk to return to prison.\u00a0 Researchers at Yale University found that ex-offenders who attend an offender notification meeting in Chicago are30% less likely to commit a new offensethan those who did not attend a meeting.\n\nThe quarterly youth forums assist children aged 13-17 to identify a path other than gang membership.\u00a0 The youth forums are conducted in partnership with CPD, the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center, and the University of Chicago Crime Lab, which tracks the progress of the children to assess results.",

            "article_text": "Dr. James Patrick Lewis, of Fairview, West Virginia, has admitted to a fraud charge involving West Virginia University, the Department of Justice announced.\n\nLewis, age 54, pleaded guilty to a one-count information charging him with \u201cFederal Program Fraud.\u201d From 2006 to August 2019, Lewis was a tenured professor at West Virginia University in the physics department, specializing in molecular reactions used in coal conversion technologies. In July 2017, Lewis entered into a contract of employment with the People\u2019s Republic of China through its \u201cGlobal Experts 1000 Talents Plan.\u201d China\u2019s Thousand Talents Plan is one of the most prominent Chinese Talent recruit plans that are designed to attract, recruit, and cultivate high-level scientific talent in furtherance of China\u2019s scientific development, economic prosperity and national security. These talent programs seek to lure overseas talent and foreign experts to bring their knowledge and experience to China and reward individuals for stealing proprietary information.\n\n\u201cLewis defrauded a public university into giving him leave, so that he could satisfy his competing obligations to a Chinese institution, which he hid from the school,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers. \u00a0\u201cI applaud the increased focus of the academic community to detect conflicts of interest and conflicts of commitment.\u00a0 Only with more transparency will we stem the tide of covert ties to Chinese institutions and programs, ties meant by the Chinese government to result in the transfer of intellectual property from the United States.\"\n\n\u201cThis case represents an attempt to serve China to the detriment of West Virginia University and the United States. Academia is a prime target for these activities and we will remain committed to prosecuting such fraud wherever it is found. I want to thank the FBI, the IRS and our prosecution team for a job well done,\u201d said U.S Attorney Bill Powell, Northern District of West Virginia.\n\n\u201cThe FBI knows the Chinese government intentionally targets the advanced technologies and technical expertise developed in the U.S. to give itself a competitive advantage in the world marketplace,\u201d said FBI Pittsburgh Special Agent in Charge Robert Jones. \u201cParticipation in a talent plan like the one Dr. Lewis was part of is not illegal. But FBI investigations have revealed participants are often incentivized to transfer proprietary information or research conducted in the U.S. to China. This remains a significant threat and a high priority threat for the FBI. We are dedicated to making sure foreign governments know U.S. trade secrets cannot and will not be bought.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lewis\u2019s contract, the Chinese Academy of Sciences agreed to employ Lewis as a professor for at least three years. In return, Lewis agreed to maintain an active research program that yielded publications in high quality, peer-reviewed journals, and to provide research training and experience for Chinese Academy of Sciences students.\n\nAs a part of the program, Lewis was promised benefits, including a living subsidy of 1 million Yuan (approximately $143,000), a research subsidy of 4 million Yuan (approximately $573,000), and a salary of 600,000 Yuan (approximately $86,000). To receive the benefits, Lewis would have to work full time in China for three consecutive years, for no less than nine months per year, and would have to begin work no later than Aug. 8, 2018.\n\nIn March 2018, Lewis submitted a request to WVU for an alternate/parental work assignment, requesting to be released from his teaching duties for the fall 2018 semester in order to serve as the primary caregiver for a child he and his wife were expecting in June 2018. In fact, however, Lewis knew this request was fraudulent. Rather than caring for his newborn child, Lewis planned to work in China during the fall 2018 semester as a part of his agreement with the \u201c1000 Talents Plan.\u201d Based on the false justification Lewis offered, WVU granted his request.\n\nIn the fall of 2018, Lewis spent all but three weeks of the semester in China while his newborn child remained in the United States. During this period, Lewis received his full salary from WVU pursuant to his alternate/parental work assignment. Lewis\u2019s scheme allowed him to fraudulently obtain $20,189 from WVU.\n\nAs a part of the plea agreement, Lewis has agreed to pay restitution in the amount of $20,189 in full to WVU.\u00a0 Lewis is no longer employed by WVU, having resigned in August 2019.\n\nLewis faces up to 10 years incarceration and a fine of up to $250,000. Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, the actual sentence imposed will be based upon the seriousness of the offenses and the prior criminal history, if any, of the defendant.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney\u00a0Jarod J. Douglas and Trial Attorney Evan N. Turgeon with the Department of Justice\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section, National Security Division, are prosecuting\u00a0the case on behalf of the government. The FBI and the Internal Revenue Service investigated. WVU cooperated in the investigation of this case.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Michael John Aloi presided.",

(IMC) and two individuals, Glen Michaels and Alan Lewis, have agreed to pay $275,000 to resolve allegations that the company improperly evaded customs duties on imports of wooden bedroom furniture from the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), in violation of the False Claims Act. IMC imports, among other things, bedroom furniture that is sold for use in university student housing. The company is headquartered in Addington, Texas. Glen Michaels is an IMC executive, and Alan Lewis was an IMC agent.\n\n\n\n\u201cThose who import and sell foreign-made goods in the United States must comply with the law, including laws intended to protect domestic companies and American workers from unfair foreign competition,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Chad A. Readler of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division. \u201cThis settlement reflects the Department of Justice\u2019s commitment to pursue those who seek to evade import duties owed on goods manufactured abroad thereby gaining an unfair advantage in U.S. markets.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe settlement announced today resolves allegations that IMC, led by Glen Michaels and Alan Lewis, evaded antidumping duties on wooden bedroom furniture imported from the PRC between 2009 and 2014, by misclassifying the furniture as non-bedroom furniture on its official import documents. Antidumping duties protect against foreign companies \u201cdumping\u201d products on the U.S. market at prices below cost. The U.S. Department of Commerce assesses and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) collects these duties to protect U.S. businesses and level the playing field for domestic products. At the time of the imports alleged in this case, wooden bedroom furniture from the PRC was subject to a 216 percent antidumping duty; non-bedroom furniture was not subject to any antidumping duties.\n\n\n\nThe investigation was handled by the Civil Division\u2019s Commercial Litigation Branch, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Texas and CBP.\n\n\n\nThe claims resolved by this settlement are allegations only; there has been no determination of liability.\n\n",

            "article_text": "Baltimore, Maryland\u2013 The University of Maryland, College Park (UMD) has agreed to pay $500,000 to resolve allegations that it violated the False Claims Act by failing to disclose current and pending support from foreign sources for faculty members who were principal investigators (PI) or co-PIs of federal research grant proposals.\n\nThe settlement relates to research grant support UMD received from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Department of the Army between 2015 and 2020. These agencies require grant applicants to disclose all current and pending support received by the institution, its PIs, and co-PIs.\u00a0 Current and pending support is defined as all resources from whatever source \u2014 including foreign government sources \u2014 that are made available to researchers in support of and/or related to their research endeavors. The agencies rely on the accuracy of these disclosures, in part, to avoid funding duplicative research projects and to ensure their highly competitive grants are awarded only to PIs who demonstrate they have the time and ability to perform the planned work. Non-disclosure of required information can result in missed opportunities for other applicants to receive funding for their own research.\n\nThis investigation began as a proactive initiative spearheaded by the NSF Office of Inspector General (OIG) to determine if foreign gifts and contracts subject to Section 117 of the Department of Education\u2019s Higher Education Act of 1965 were also being disclosed in federal grant proposals, as required.\n\nThe United States alleged UMD knowingly failed to disclose current and pending foreign funding that three UMD researchers had sought and received, in five research grant proposals submitted to the NSF and Army. Specifically, the United States alleged UMD failed to disclose to NSF gift funding from Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. to a PI for research in \u201chigh energy density FeF3 conversion cathode materials and Li metal anodes.\u201d Additionally, the United States alleged UMD failed to disclose to the NSF and Army grant funding to two other PIs from Taobao (China) Software Co., Ltd. (Alibaba), titled, \u201cLarge-Scale Behavior Learning for Dense Crowds\u201d, and \u201cCyber-Manufacturing of Customized Apparel.\u201d\n\n\u201cComplete and accurate disclosures are essential to federal agencies that make decisions on awarding federal grants,\u201d said Erek L. Barron, United States Attorney for the District of Maryland.\u00a0 \u201cThose individuals and universities that knowingly fail to do so skew the grant awarding process in their favor and will be held accountable.\u201d\n\n\u201cNSF plays a major role in the U.S. research enterprise, providing about 25% of all Federal support to America\u2019s colleges and universities for basic research. Lack of institutional oversight of individuals receiving Federal funds poses a serious risk to the success of that enterprise. This investigation was one of NSF OIG\u2019s proactive efforts focused on determining compliance with critical grant terms and conditions, including mandatory disclosures. As this case demonstrated, the failure of institutional oversight can foster noncompliance and present significant challenges to the integrity of the Federal research funding process,\u201d said NSF Inspector General Allison Lerner. \u201cWe thank the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Maryland and our investigative partners for their work in protecting federally funded research.\u201d\n\nThe claims resolved by this settlement are allegations only, and there has been no determination of liability.\n\nThe resolution obtained in this matter was the result of a coordinated effort between the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Maryland, with assistance from the NSF OIG and the Department of the Army Criminal Investigation Division.\n\nThe matter was investigated by Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas F. Corcoran for the District of Maryland.\n\n##",

            "article_text": "Tampa, Florida - U.S. Attorney Robert E. O'Neill announced today that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations has made another seizure of counterfeit DVDs in Lakeland. The seizure is part of a global counterfeit motion picture DVD investigation that began in Lakeland, and extended to the People\u2019s Republic of China. Today\u2019s seizures netted approximately 10,000 counterfeit DVDs, approximately $30,000 in cash, and about $144,000 from two bank accounts. The amounts from two additional seized bank accounts have yet to be determined. Thus far, seven people have been charged federally for their roles in the case. Each of the seven previously pleaded guilty.  Six of them have already been sentenced.\n\nOn August 10, 2012, Jian Huang (People's Republic of China, 37) pleaded guilty to conspiracy and trafficking in counterfeit goods. He was sentenced to 51 months in federal prison on November 2, 2012.  The court also ordered Huang to pay restitution to the Motion Picture Association of America (\u201cMPAA\u201d) in the amount of $1,214,333.12.  The MPAA is a trade association that represents certain motion picture, home video and television industry companies, including Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc.; Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.; Paramount Pictures Corp.; Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp.; Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures; and Universal Studios.\n\nAccording to court documents, in 2010 or earlier, Huang and his Chinese-based company (\"TM Wholesale\") began making bulk sales of counterfeit motion picture DVDs, along with counterfeit packaging, to buyers in the United States and throughout the world.  Huang\u2019s counterfeit conspiracy included multiple bulk purchasers in the Lakeland area.  The bulk purchasers would buy the counterfeit DVDs from Huang at approximately $1.28 per unit.  The purchasers would then resell them online, via Amazon and E-Bay, as genuine DVDs. Unsuspecting customers were then charged a retail price of approximately $12 per DVD.\n\nOn July 27, 2011, and April 24, 2012, law enforcement agents seized a total of approximately 113,618 counterfeit DVDs from three bulk purchasers in Polk County.  The DVDs were all supplied by Huang.  Agents also gathered evidence revealing that, between January 8, 2009, and May 2012, payments of more than $2.5 million were made to Huang\u2019s PayPal account.  The payments came from approximately 270 different bulk purchasers with addresses located primarily in the United States.\n\n\u201cIntellectual property theft is not a victimless crime. When individuals pirate trademarked movies, they cost American businesses billions of dollars in revenue, which in turn, leads to the loss of American jobs,\u201d said Shane Folden, deputy special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations Tampa.\n\n\u201cThe Lakeland Police Department\u2019s Special Investigations Section committed a Cross Designee Detective, Task Force Officer, to the Department of Homeland Security for this investigation for the past 18 months,\u201d said Assistant Chief Mike Link. \u201cDuring this extensive investigation, Lakeland detectives partnered with the Department of Homeland Security to provide a myriad of covert investigative support and assistance to help eradicate this global criminal enterprise. As a result, a valued partnership has been established between the Department of Homeland Security and the Lakeland Police Department that will pay huge dividends to both agencies and the community in the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement is a victory for both American consumers and the millions of men and women who work in the creative industries,\u201d said Mike Robinson, Executive Vice President for Content Protection at the Motion Picture Association of America. \u201cWe applaud U.S. law enforcement and the U.S. Attorney General\u2019s Office for successfully bringing to justice these foreign criminals who were illegally profiting off the ingenuity and creativity of Americans workers. This effort was a vital step toward protecting both the livelihoods of millions of hardworking Americans, and a thriving legitimate market for the movies and TV shows that audiences love.\u201d\n\nSix of Huang\u2019s co-conspirators, including Alex Lee Lim (Lakeland, 37), Robert Edmond Mattie (Winter Haven, 27), James William Ray (Bartow, 35), Donald Kenneth Brown, Jr. (Lakeland, 38), Martin William Grenfell (Lakeland, 49), and Christopher Alexander T. Clark (Lakeland, 47), previously pleaded guilty to trafficking in counterfeit labels.  On November 15, 2012, Lim was sentenced to 51 months in federal prison, and was ordered to pay restitution to the MPAA in the amount of $280,752.67.  On November 30, 2012, Ray was sentenced to 46 months in federal prison, and was ordered to pay $261,541.28 in restitution to the MPAA.  Ray was also ordered to forfeit $100,005 in cash seized at the time of his arrest.  On December 6, 2012, Mattie was sentenced to probation for a term of 5 years, with the first 12 months to be served on home detention.  On February 22, 2013, Grenfell was sentenced to 3 years\u2019 probation and Brown was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison and was ordered to pay $3,000 in restitution to the MPAA.  Clark pleaded guilty on February 8, 2013, and is scheduled to be sentenced on May 3, 2013.  He faces a maximum penalty of 5 years in federal prison.  As part of his plea agreement, Clark has agreed to forfeit $260,470.55 in counterfeit proceeds.\n\nThis case was investigated by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations and the Lakeland Police Department.  It is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Mark E. Bini.",

Fein, 52, has announced his resignation, effective May 13,  2013, and his intention to return to the private sector.\n\nMr. Fein was appointed by President  Obama and sworn in as the 50th U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut on  May 10, 2010.\u00a0 As U.S. Attorney, Mr. Fein  created the Connecticut Securities, Commodities and Investor Fraud Task Force,  a multi-agency task force focused on matters related to investor fraud, Ponzi  schemes, insider trading, FCPA and other financial crimes.\u00a0 He also initiated Project Longevity, a new  state-wide anti-violence initiative aimed at reducing gun and gang violence.\n\n\u201cIt has been an honor to serve as United  States Attorney and to work alongside the fine women and men of this Office and  of our partner federal, state and local law enforcement agencies as we serve  the people of Connecticut and the country,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Fein.\u00a0 \u201cPersonally, it is the right time for me and  my family that I move on, but I do so humbly and profoundly grateful for the  trust placed in me by the President and the Attorney General.\u201d\n\nAs U.S. Attorney, Mr. Fein restructured  the Office\u2019s Criminal Division.\u00a0  Previously organized geographically, the Office\u2019s Criminal Division was  restructured so that it comprises three program-based units:\u00a0 National Security and Major Crimes, Violent  Crimes and Narcotics, and Financial Fraud and Public Corruption.\n\nSignificant recent enforcement matters  for the National Security and Major Crimes Unit include the extradition of  Babar Ahmad and Syed Talha Ahsan, both British citizens who have been charged  with terrorism-related offenses; the disabling of a network of hundreds of  thousands of computers infected with a malicious software program known as  Coreflood, which was the most complete and comprehensive enforcement action  ever taken by U.S authorities to disable an international botnet; the  prosecution of Hector Natal, who earlier this month was found guilty of  committing the March 2011 New Haven arson that killed three individuals,  including an 8-year-old boy; the prosecution of a Canadian subsidiary of United  Technologies Corporation for violating the Arms Export Control Act in  connection with its illegal export to China of U.S.-origin military software  used in the development of China\u2019s first modern military attack helicopter; and  more than 60 child exploitation matters, including the prosecution of Douglas  Perlitz, who was sentenced to more than 19 years in prison for sexually abusing  several minor victims over the course of a decade in Haiti, Edgardo Sensi, who  was sentenced to 85 years of imprisonment for sexual abusing minor girls in the  U.S. and Nicaragua, and Jesse Osmun, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison  for sexually abusing young girls while he was a volunteer with the U.S. Peace  Corps in South Africa.\n\nThe Violent Crimes and Narcotics Unit  has focused on dismantling large-scale drug trafficking organizations,  prosecuting gang and gun violence, and enforcement actions against prescription  drug trafficking.\u00a0 Significant  prosecutions include Bridgeport drug trafficker Azibo Aquart and his  associates, who were convicted of brutally murdering three Bridgeport residents  in August 2005;

The Honorable Judge Timothy L. Brooks presided over the sentencing hearing in the United States District Court in Fayetteville.\n\nAccording to court documents,Simon Saw-Teong Ang, 65, of Fayetteville, filed 24 patents in the People\u2019s Republic of China bear Ang\u2019s name or Chinese birth name. The University of Arkansas, where Ang worked as a professor, required individuals such as Ang to promptly furnish to the University \u201cfull and complete\u201d disclosures of inventions, and University policy provided that it, not individual inventors, would own all inventions created by those subject to the policy. This policy was established \u201cin furtherance of the commitment of the University to the widest possible distribution of the benefits of University Research, the protection of Inventions resulting from such research, and the development of Inventions for the public good.\u201d\n\nDespite this requirement, Ang did not disclose his Chinese patents to the university and, when interviewed by an FBI agent, lied about his involvement in the inventions. Specifically, when asked whether his name would be listed as \u201cthe inventor\u201d of numerous patents in China, Ang denied being the inventor, despite knowing he was. In addition, Ang also received numerous talent awards from the PRC government, which he did not list on the university\u2019s annual conflict of interest disclosure forms.\n\nU.S. Attorney David Clay Fowlkes of the Western District of Arkansas, Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division and FBI Little Rock Special Agent in Charge James A. Dawson made the announcement.\n\nThe FBI, the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Diplomatic Security Service (DSS), NASA Office of Inspector General and Air Force Office of Special Investigations investigated the case.\n\nU.S. Attorney David Clay Fowlkes from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Arkansas and Trial Attorney Christine Bonomo from the Department of Justice National Security Division prosecuted\u00a0the case.",

Hamdani.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office (USAO) along with FBI, Homeland Security Investigations, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the Food and Drug Administration provided the training which included essential tools and protocols for TMC attendees to follow if their facilities are subject to cyber intrusions.\n\nMethodist Hospital hosted the training event with attendees from Memorial Herman Hospital, Texas Children\u2019s Hospital, MD Anderson, Baylor College of Medicine and the University of Texas Health System.\n\nCriminal organizations and nation state actors like China, Russia and Iran as well as other bad actors have become more sophisticated in their ability to launch cyber-attacks against critical infrastructure such as the health care facilities in the TMC.\n\n\u201cIt is essential to national security and crucial to the safety of patients for federal law enforcement to work closely with the health care sector to develop resilient and adaptive defenses against malicious cyberspace activity and network intrusions,\u201d said Hamdani. \u201cThe USAO will continue to seek opportunities to enhance collaboration with our law enforcement partners and the health care industry to prevent potential network intrusions and ensure greater unity of effort in response to cyber incidents.\u201d\n\nOn a weekly basis, hundreds of cyberattacks occur on businesses all across the Southern District of Texas. There must be a quick response team in place to immediately address the intrusion in order to circumvent major damage and losses.\u00a0The USAO routinely works with other prosecutors and law enforcement in the district to stay ahead of potential cyber threats.\n\nAs the global economy enters another year of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and China continues to seek to disrupt critical industries like the health care sector, the private industry must be reminded to be diligent about their networks and to know their response plans, have a paper copy available and review their cyber-related insurance policies.\n\nThe USAO has established contact lines for assistance 24 hours a day.

            "article_text": "Two Iranian nationals have been charged in connection with a coordinated cyber intrusion campaign \u2013 sometimes at the behest of the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran (Iran) \u2013 targeting computers in New Jersey, elsewhere in the United States, Europe and the Middle East, the Department of Justice announced today.\n\nAccording to a 10-count indictment returned on Sept. 15, 2020, Hooman Heidarian, a/k/a \u201cneo,\u201d 30, and Mehdi Farhadi, a/k/a \u201cMehdi Mahdavi\u201d and \u201cMohammad Mehdi Farhadi Ramin,\u201d 34, both of Hamedan, Iran, stole hundreds of terabytes of data, which typically included confidential communications pertaining to national security, foreign policy intelligence, non-military nuclear information, aerospace data, human rights activist information, victim financial information and personally identifiable information, and intellectual property, including unpublished scientific research.\u00a0 In some instances, the defendants\u2019 hacks were politically motivated or at the behest of Iran, including instances where they obtained information regarding dissidents, human rights activists, and opposition leaders.\u00a0 In other instances, the defendants sold the hacked data and information on the black market for private financial gain.\n\n\u201cWe will not bring the rule of law to cyberspace until governments refuse to provide safe harbor for criminal hacking within their borders,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers.\u00a0 \u201cUnfortunately, our cases demonstrate that at least four nations \u2014 Iran, China, Russia and North Korea \u2014 will allow criminal hackers to victimize individuals and companies from around the world, as long as these hackers will also work for that country\u2019s government \u2014 gathering information on human rights activists, dissidents and others of intelligence interest.\u00a0 Today\u2019s defendants will now learn that such service to the Iranian regime is not an asset, but a criminal yoke that they will now carry until the day they are brought to justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese Iranian nationals allegedly conducted a wide-ranging campaign on computers here in New Jersey and around the world,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Carpenito for the District of New Jersey. \u201cThey brazenly infiltrated computer systems and targeted intellectual property and often sought to intimidate perceived enemies of Iran, including dissidents fighting for human rights in Iran and around the world. This conduct threatens our national security, and as a result, these defendants are wanted by the FBI and are considered fugitives from justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe indictment of two Iranian nationals charged with computer hacking, fraud, and aggravated identity theft demonstrates how the FBI continues to work relentlessly with our law enforcement partners to identify cybercriminals\u00a0who seek to do harm to American citizens, businesses, and universities,\u00a0regardless of where those criminals may reside and hold them accountable,\u201d said George M. Crouch Jr., Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Newark Division. \u201cMehdi Farhadi and Hooman Heidarian are now fugitives and have been added to the FBI website for charges in connection with a massive, coordinated cyber intrusion campaign. These actions demonstrate how imposing risks and consequences on our cyber adversaries will continue to be a top priority for the FBI.\u201d\n\nAccording to the indictment:\n\nBeginning in at least 2013, the defendants were responsible for a coordinated campaign of cyber intrusions into computer systems in New Jersey and around the world. The victims included several American and foreign universities, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, a defense contractor, an aerospace company, a foreign policy organization, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), non-profits, and foreign government and other entities the defendants identified as rivals or adversaries to Iran.\u00a0 In addition to the theft of highly protected and sensitive data, the defendants also vandalized websites, often under the pseudonym \u201cSejeal\u201d and posted messages that appeared to signal the demise of Iran\u2019s internal opposition, foreign adversaries, and countries identified as rivals to Iran, including Israel and Saudi Arabia.\n\nTo select their victims, the defendants conducted online reconnaissance, including gathering public data and intelligence to determine a victim\u2019s areas of expertise, and using vulnerability scanning tools and other means to assess computer networks. \u00a0The defendants gained and maintained unauthorized access to victim networks using various tools, including: session hijacking, where a valid computer session was exploited to gain unauthorized access to information or services in a computer system; SQL injection, in which they used malicious code to access information that was not intended to be displayed, such as sensitive government data, user details, and personal identifiers; and malicious programs installations, which allowed the defendants to maintain unauthorized access to computers.\n\nThe defendants then used key-loggers and \u201cremote access Trojans\u201d to maintain access and monitor the actions of users of the victim networks. They also developed a botnet tool, which facilitated the spread of malware, denial of service attacks, and spamming to victim networks. In some instances, the defendants used their unauthorized access to victim networks or accounts to establish automated forwarding rules for compromised victim accounts, whereby new outgoing and incoming emails were automatically forwarded from the compromised accounts to accounts controlled by defendants.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Demers and U.S. Attorney Carpenito credited special agents of the FBI, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Crouch in Newark, with the investigation leading to the charges.\n\nEach defendant is charged with: one count of conspiracy to commit fraud and related activity in connection with computers and access devices; unauthorized access to protected computers; unauthorized damage to protected computers; conspiracy to commit wire fraud; and access device fraud; and five counts of aggravated identity theft.\n\nThe counts of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and related activity in connection with computers and access devices, and unauthorized access to protected computers, each carry a maximum sentence of five years in prison. The counts of unauthorized damage to protected computers and access device fraud each carry a maximum sentence of ten years in prison.\u00a0 The count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. The counts of aggravated identity theft each carry a mandatory sentence of two years in prison.\n\nThe government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney Dean C. Sovolos of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office National Security Unit, Daniel V. Shapiro, Deputy Chief of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office Criminal Division, and Trial Attorney Scott McCulloch of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.\n\nThe charges and allegations contained in the indictment are merely accusations and the defendants are considered innocent unless and until proven guilty.",

Kullyand Trial AttorneysWilliam H. Jones II,John R. Read,Adam C. SpeegleandNathan P. Sutton; from the Antitrust Division\u2019s Appellate Section, Section ChiefKristen C. Limarziand Trial AttorneyShana M.

Fleming; and from the Criminal Division\u2019s Appellate Section, Trial AttorneyFinnuala K. Tessier.\n\nThe Antitrust Division\u2019s victory against Apple Inc. for orchestrating a conspiracy to raise the prices of e-books represents one of the most significant civil litigation victories that the division has achieved in over a decade, and it has led to state attorneys general and private plaintiffs recovering on behalf of harmed consumers approximately $566 million in damages.\u00a0 The recipients represented the United States in trial against Apple in June 2013 and successfully defended the case against Apple\u2019s appeal.\u00a0 In April 2010, when Apple launched its iBookstore and entered the e-books market, U.S. e-book prices rose uniformly, in some instances as much as 50 percent.\u00a0 The division launched an investigation into possible coordination among e-book publishers and Apple and, in April 2012, brought suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging a conspiracy to raise e-book prices in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.\u00a0 Over the course of the litigation, all the publishers settled with the federal government.\u00a0 However, Apple aggressively litigated the matter through a three-week trial in June 2013 before U.S. District Judge Denise Cote, who issued a 160-page order finding Apple liable for orchestrating a scheme among five of the six largest book publishers to raise e-book prices in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.\u00a0 Apple\u2019s vigorous efforts to pursue the matter on appeal ended in March 2016 when the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) rejected Apple\u2019s petition for certiorari to review the Second Circuit\u2019s decision affirming Judge Cote\u2019s order.\u00a0 The litigation of this action and the precedent created by the trial court\u2019s and Second Circuit\u2019s decisions should deter those who in the future might contemplate violating U.S. antitrust laws.\n\nThe third Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the Antitrust Division\u2019s New York Office, Section ChiefJeffrey D.

Winters; and from the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office, Special AgentsJennifer RikerandJeffrey Weeksand Forensic AccountantKyle D. Dornbos.\n\nThe recipients, through their leadership, dedication and tireless investigation of price fixing and bid rigging, are responsible for the historic prosecution of five of the world\u2019s largest financial institutions that agreed to pay fines in excess of $2.7 billion.\u00a0 The investigation uncovered a conspiracy that affected the U.S. Dollar to Euro exchange rate.\u00a0 These currencies are at the heart of international commerce, and the conspiracy undermined the integrity and the competitiveness of foreign currency exchange markets which account for hundreds of billions of dollars of transactions every day.\u00a0 The companies responsible for actions that eliminated competition in the marketplace were held accountable for their illegal conduct, which will hopefully deter financial institutions from chasing profits without regard to fairness, the law or the public welfare.\n\nThe fourth Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the Office of the Solicitor General, Assistant to the Solicitor GeneralEric J. Feigin; from the Civil Rights Division\u2019s Appellate Section, ChiefDiana K. Flynn, Principal Deputy ChiefSharon M. McGowanand Trial AttorneyRobert A. Koch; and from the Civil Division\u2019s Appellate Staff, DirectorDouglas N. Letterand AttorneysJeffrey E. SandbergandAbby C. Wright.\n\nIn Obergefell v. Hodges, SCOTUS struck down state bans on marriage equality that denied to same-sex couples and their children the protections and benefits of marriage.\u00a0 In doing so, SCOTUS granted LGBT individuals equal access to marriage and vindicated the Obama Administration\u2019s strong interest in the eradication of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.\u00a0 This team is honored for its extraordinary work in this historic case.\u00a0 Under immense time pressures, the recipients worked collaboratively to craft a compelling, persuasive and successful legal brief on a seminal civil rights issue.\u00a0 The brief reiterated the department\u2019s US v. Windsor position that classifications based on sexual orientation should trigger heightened scrutiny and described the harm that the state bans inflicted on same-sex couples and their families.\u00a0 In June 2015, SCOTUS issued a powerful decision extending the right to marry to same-sex couples and joining the ranks of landmark civil rights pronouncements from the court.\n\nThe fifth Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the Criminal Division\u2019s Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section, Deputy ChiefMatthew R. Stiglitz, Special CounselStacey Luckand Paralegal SpecialistLinda Faulk; from the Criminal Division\u2019s Office of International Affairs, Associate DirectorMagdalena Boynton; from the Criminal Division\u2019s Narcotic and Dangerous Drug Division, Judicial Attach\u00e9Marlon Cobar; from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office of the Eastern District of Virginia, Assistant U.S. AttorneyMichael P.

Quintero; from the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office, Special AgentBeau Bourgeois; and from the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Special AgentSuhaib Karim Qureshi.\n\nOn June 20, 2013, DEA Special Agent James Terry Watson was stabbed to death during an attempted kidnapping and robbery perpetrated by an organized group of taxi drivers in Bogota.\u00a0 A team of investigators and prosecutors was assembled, and working with their Colombian counterparts, they quickly identified seven individuals responsible for the murder and subsequent destruction of evidence.\u00a0 In an example of teamwork and coordination at its best, a complaint was filed and arrest warrants were obtained for the suspects within four days of the crime; within 18 months, the defendants\u2019 extraditions were secured and they were all convicted.\u00a0 Because of the diligent work of those assigned to the case, justice was served for the family of Special Agent Watson.\n\nThe sixth Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the Criminal Division\u2019s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section, ChiefSteven J. Grockiand Deputy ChiefKeith A.

StanleyandJeffrey D. Tarpinian.\n\nThe recipients are recognized for their involvement in Operation Torpedo, a precedent-setting investigation that used first-of-its-kind techniques to infiltrate the dark internet and identify individuals who, under the perceived cloak of anonymity, secretly congregated to trade images of children being sexually abused and to celebrate the sexual abuse of children.\u00a0 By developing and deploying a network investigative technique, with appropriate legal authority, investigators were able to identify members of three websites devoted to child pornography that were operating on an anonymous network.\u00a0 The investigation required round-the-clock efforts from agents, analysts and prosecutors, and rapid response to fast-breaking developments.\u00a0 Prosecutors successfully defended these novel investigations in court and have obtained convictions at every turn.\u00a0 The impact of this investigation cannot be overstated.\u00a0 It has pioneered investigative work into the dark web that has led to subsequent significant investigations by the Criminal Division and the FBI; the dismantling of more than 100 child exploitation websites; and the seizure of massive amounts of child exploitation material, the largest seizure of virtual currency to date and the discovery of 120 victims of child sexual exploitation.\n\nThe seventh Distinguished Service Award is presented to Deputy ChiefFranz R. Marshallof the Civil Rights Division\u2019s Educational Opportunities Section.\u00a0 Marshall is recognized for his remarkable 43 years of service to the department, virtually all of which has been spent in the Civil Rights Division, where he has dedicated each day to breaking down barriers to educational opportunities for students across the country.\u00a0 Over the course of his career, he has represented the United States in hundreds of desegregation cases and through this work, Marshall has fiercely protected and embodied a core and founding mission of the Civil Rights Division, dismantling obstacles to opportunity and success in America\u2019s public schools.\u00a0 Furthermore, Marshall has shaped the legal landscape and cleared paths to a better life for countless students.\u00a0 He has given voice to children and parents in communities throughout the United States, from Native Americans in the Four Corners to African Americans in the Louisiana Bayou.\u00a0 In short, no department lawyer has done more to open the schoolhouse doors to all children and to fulfill the principles and promise of Brown v. Board of Education.\n\nThe eighth Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the Environment and Natural Resources Division\u2019s Environmental Enforcement Section, Section ChiefThomas A.

Spiro.\n\nTo redress the BP/Deepwater Horizon disaster, the largest oil spill in U.S. history, this team successfully pursued the companies responsible for this multimillion-barrel oil spill.\u00a0 The recipients resolved the nation\u2019s civil claims against those companies for more than $6.6 billion in civil penalties; more than $8 billion in natural resource damages; hundreds of millions of dollars in cleanup, assessment and other costs; and injunctive relief that should make for safer drilling operations in the Gulf of Mexico.\u00a0 Under applicable law, the majority of these funds will fuel restoration of natural resources and some economic redevelopment in the Gulf of Mexico region.\u00a0 The matter is the department\u2019s largest-ever environmental enforcement effort.\u00a0 The team\u2019s work also made it possible for the five Gulf states and their local governments to settle their economic damage claims for sums approaching another $5.9 billion.\n\nThe ninth Distinguished Service Award is presented to Assistant U.S. AttorneysMichelle B. Alvarez,Jeffrey N. Kaplan,Lawrence D. LaVecchio,Alison W. Lehr,Paul F. Schwartz,Evelyn B. SheehanandMadeleine Shirleyof the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Florida.\n\nIn October 2009, it was discovered that attorney Scott Rothstein was conducting one of the largest Ponzi schemes in American history through the operation of the Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, law firm of Rothstein Rosenfeldt & Adler P.A. (RRA).\u00a0 The basis of the scheme was the sale of securities in which investors purchased the rights to a stream of payments from corporate entities which ostensibly had reached confidential settlements with purported plaintiffs in sexual harassment, employment discrimination and whistleblower cases.\u00a0 Settlements were available for purchase in amounts ranging from hundreds of thousands to tens of millions of dollars.\u00a0 During the operation of the scheme, hundreds of investors remitted more than $1.2 billion to RRA, which funds were utilized to pay previous investors in the scheme to finance a lavish lifestyle for the participants, and to make political and charitable contributions which enhanced the prestige and visibility of RRA, thereby enhancing RRA\u2019s ability to attract new investors.\u00a0 During the ensuing six years of litigation, 29 defendants, including attorneys and public officials, were convicted and sentenced on charges including racketeering, wire fraud, money laundering, income tax fraud, campaign finance violations, obstruction of justice, extortion and civil rights violations.\u00a0 Additionally, through forfeiture proceedings instituted by the government, coupled with proceedings in bankruptcy court and other ancillary civil proceedings, more than $400 million in assets were ultimately recovered, resulting in full restitution to the defrauded investors.\n\nThe 10thDistinguished Service Award is presented to, from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office of the Southern District of New York, Assistant U.S. AttorneysJohn P.

Butsch; and from the National Security Division\u2019s Office of the Assistant Attorney General, Deputy Assistant Attorney GeneralGeorge Z. Toscas.\n\nFor upwards of a decade, Abu Hamza stood as one of the most powerful, dangerous and recognizable terrorist leaders on the planet.\u00a0 Through his oratorical skills and sophisticated use of the internet, he indoctrinated his young, impressionable followers with his murderous message, inspiring the likes of Richard Reid, Zacarias Moussaoui and Mohammed Siddiqui Kahn.\u00a0 Additionally, Abu Hamza himself engaged in acts of terror that spanned the globe including the December 1998 hostage-taking in Yemen, which included two U.S. citizens and left four victims dead; the attempt to establish a terrorist training camp for al Qaeda on U.S. soil in late 1999; sending of one of his devoted followers to Afghanistan in 2000 to train and fight with al Qaeda; and supporting the Taliban from 2000 to 2001.\u00a0 Abu Hamza was arrested in the United Kingdom in 2004, but fought extradition for nearly a decade before he was extradited in October 2012.\u00a0 In preparing for trial, the recipients analyzed massive volumes of evidence recovered from across the globe, and identified witnesses in multiple continents to build and solidify a criminal case.\u00a0 The team also engaged in classified and unclassified litigation leading to and during trial, working in close coordination with the U.S. intelligence community to protect national security equities.\u00a0 Overcoming the inherent challenges in prosecuting a case where the conduct occurred approximately 15 years earlier, and where the evidence and witnesses were spread across the globe, the team secured a conviction on all 11 counts.\u00a0 Furthermore, Abu Hamza has been permanently incapacitated from future terrorist acts.\n\nThe 11thDistinguished Service Award is presented to, from the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office, Supervisory Special AgentWilliam J.

Flanaganand Program AnalystsTanique D. CarterandMichael H. Chang.\n\nThis team led a comprehensive review of the impact that an aging inmate population has on the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP).\u00a0 The elimination of parole, use of mandatory minimum sentences, increases in average sentence length over the past three decades and an increase in white collar offenders and sex offenders, among other things, have contributed to the aging federal inmate population.\u00a0 The recipients were in the field for eight months, interviewing nearly 170 officials and staff from each of the BOP\u2019s eight divisions, as well as 13 institutions.\u00a0 The team conducted site visits of institutions at all security levels, and did extensive document reviews and quantitative analysis spanning a five-year period.\u00a0 Policies applying to various aspects of the care of aging inmates were numerous and scattered among different program areas.\u00a0 To overcome limitations in available data, the team conducted wide-ranging quantitative analyses.\u00a0 The OIG report, issued in May 2015, found that aging inmates are more costly to incarcerate due to increased medical needs, that the physical infrastructure of BOP institutions limits the availability of appropriate housing for aging inmates and that BOP does not provide programming opportunities designed to meet their particular needs.\u00a0 The report also found that aging inmates engage in fewer misconduct incidents while incarcerated and, based on statistical review, appear to have a lower rate of re-arrest once released.\u00a0 Beyond merely identifying these issues, the report provided eight concrete recommendations to address them in order to assist BOP in managing its aging inmate population.\u00a0 After reviewing the report and recommendations, the BOP created formed an interdisciplinary task force to address a number of the recommendations.\n\nTheAttorney General\u2019s Award for Exceptional Service in Indian Countryrecognizes extraordinary efforts by department employees who demonstrate the department\u2019s commitment to fighting crime in Indian Country. \u00a0This year\u2019s award is presented to, from the Criminal Division\u2019s Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section, Trial AttorneyJ.

Sullivan of the District of Columbia.\u00a0 During a five-week, highly publicized trial, the trial team made its case largely through the documents and adverse testimony of GE and Electrolux, uncooperative competitors and economic analysis, demonstrating that the merger would have a significant effect on the prices of ranges, cooktops and wall ovens.\u00a0 One day before trial was to conclude, GE abandoned the proposed merger and as a result, U.S. consumers will be able to save hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nThe secondJohn Marshall Award for Trial of Litigationis presented to the team responsible for the prosecution and conviction of Jeffrey Sterling.\u00a0 As a result of their tireless efforts over the course of several years, Sterling was found guilty of unauthorized disclosures of classified information vital to national security in the first Espionage Act trial of its kind in decades.\u00a0 The successful outcome was the result of over four years of complex pre-trial litigation involving classified information, covert witnesses, First Amendment issues and media subpoenas.\u00a0 At trial, the prosecutors proved that Sterling, a former CIA officer, disclosed to a journalist the details of an extremely sensitive, valuable and classified clandestine operation designed to undermine the Iranian nuclear weapons program.\u00a0 Sterling\u2019s crime not only undermined a valuable tool to attack Iran\u2019s nuclear program, but also endangered the lives of an important human asset and his family.\u00a0 The defendant\u2019s unlawful disclosures put lives at risk and constituted an egregious breach of the public trust.\u00a0 Sterling was sentenced to 42 months in prison.\u00a0 This case demonstrates the perseverance, tenacity and commitment of the prosecution team in overcoming formidable challenges in bringing this uniquely complex case to trial in the interests of justice and national security.\u00a0 Award recipients include, from the Criminal Division\u2019s Public Integrity Section, Deputy ChiefEric G. Olshan; and from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office of the Eastern District of Virginia, Assistant U.S. AttorneyDennis M. Fitzpatrickand Senior Litigation CounselJames L. Trump.\n\nThe firstJohn Marshall Award for Participation in Litigationis presented to, from the Civil Rights Division, Office of the Assistant Attorney General Senior CounselRegina Kline, Acting Chief of the Policy and Strategy SectionSheila M. Foran, Disability Rights Section Trial AttorneysNicholas C. LeeandH. Justin Parkand Housing and Civil Enforcement Section Trial AttorneyMax P. Lapertosa; and from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office of the District of Oregon, Assistant U.S. AttorneyAdrian L. Brown.\u00a0 This team is honored for its extraordinary work in securing \u2013 alongside private plaintiffs \u2013 the landmark settlement agreement remedying systemic discrimination in Oregon\u2019s employment service system for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD).\u00a0 Through the team\u2019s outstanding oral and written advocacy, a groundbreaking settlement was achieved in Lane v. Brown, the nation\u2019s first class-action lawsuit to challenge a state funded and administered employment service system, relying primarily on sheltered workshops, as a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act\u2019s (ADA) integration mandate.\u00a0 Throughout the more than three-year litigation, the team demonstrated exemplary dedication, as well as outstanding advocacy and strategy, that successfully positioned the department and private plaintiffs to obtain a comprehensive settlement agreement providing relief to approximately 7,000 people with I/DD.\u00a0 These individuals include 1,115 adults with I/DD, who have been relegated for far too long in segregated sheltered workshops when they were able and wanted to work in real jobs in the community, and roughly 4,900 youth with I/DD who will now receive employment services to choose, prepare for, get and keep jobs in a typical setting.\u00a0 The team\u2019s accomplishment serves as a model for integrated employment of persons with disabilities nationwide.\n\nThe secondJohn Marshall Award for Participation in Litigationrecognizes Assistant U.S. AttorneysLara K. EshkenaziandJeffrey K. Powellof the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York.\u00a0 As a result of the extraordinary work of the recipients, New York City\u2019s jail system is now subject to sweeping court-ordered reforms to counter the pervasive culture of violence that has plagued it for decades and has inflicted tremendous harm on inmates and correction officers alike.\u00a0 After its rigorous investigation into the treatment of adolescent inmates on Rikers Island, the team drafted a scathing 79-page report that concluded that male inmates between the ages of 16 and 18 were subject to rampant use of unnecessary and excessive force by correction staff, were not being adequately protected from violence inflicted by other inmates, and were being placed in punitive segregation for weeks or months at a time at an alarming rate.\u00a0 To force desperately needed reforms, the Southern District of New York intervened in an ongoing class action alleging a system-wide pattern and practice of excessive force.\u00a0 The recipients led the parties through many months of difficult negotiations which resulted in a groundbreaking consent decree requiring comprehensive and innovative reform designed to end the unconstitutional violence on Rikers Island.\u00a0 The consent decree also prohibits the use of punitive segregation for inmates under the age of 18.\u00a0 In approving the settlement, the district court judge described the agreement as \u201cthe product of unprecedented analysis, investigation, collaboration, commitment to the protection of rights and vision for systemic reform,\u201d and noted that it \u201cprovides an important example for other correctional systems throughout the country.\u201d\n\nThe firstJohn Marshall Award for Support of Litigationis presented to Assistant DirectorReginald T. Blades Jr.and Assistant DirectorL. Misha Preheimof the Civil Division\u2019s Commercial Litigation Branch \u2013 National Courts Section for their outstanding and successful resolution of over 3,000 claims for back pay for certain cost of living adjustments withheld by Congress brought by Article III and non-Article III judges and their beneficiaries.\u00a0 The creative and innovative web-based claims process developed and implemented by the recipients has contributed greatly to the department\u2019s fair, just and efficient resolution of complex and unwieldy putative class action claims brought against the United States in 15 different lawsuits filed in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.\n\nThe secondJohn Marshall Award for Support of Litigationrecognizes the Environment and Natural Resources Division\u2019s Pacific Salmon Team for its tireless and outstanding provision of litigation support in multiple cases involving salmon in the Pacific Northwest.\u00a0 Salmon are iconic to the Pacific Northwest and litigation over this important natural resource abounds.\u00a0 The recipients are responsible for representing several federal agencies in many pieces of complex litigation in federal district courts throughout the region.\u00a0 In this role, the team provides all aspects of legal assistance including counsel to eight federal agencies; legal review of agency actions in advance of litigation; marshalling expert witness resources and testimony; researching and drafting extensive legal briefs; coordinating positions among the various federal agencies; and representing the agencies in the courtroom.\u00a0 The cases are complex, controversial and often high-profile.\u00a0 Due to its work, the team has secured litigation outcomes allowing critical hydroelectric and navigation projects to move forward while protecting the needs of salmon.\u00a0 Their efforts have also resulted in significant improvement of federal and tribal relations.\u00a0 The awardees are, from the Environment and Natural Resources Division\u2019s Wildlife and Marine Resources Section, Senior Trial AttorneysMichael R. EitelandCarter H. Howelland Trial AttorneyAndrea E. Gelatt; and from the Environment and Natural Resources Division\u2019s Natural Resources Section, Senior Trial AttorneysRomney S. Philpott IIIandKristofor R. Swanson.\n\nTheJohn Marshall Award for Handling of Appealsis presented to Trial AttorneyArthur T. Catterallof the Tax Division\u2019s Appellate Section.\u00a0 Catterall is recognized for his exceptional work as an appellate advocate in tackling some of the most difficult civil tax cases to come before the Courts of Appeals in recent years, including tax shelter cases combining complex factual patterns with thorny issues of statutory interpretation.\u00a0 His collaborative work with trial and agency counsel, and his clear and eloquent arguments on behalf of the federal government, have exposed the fallacies at the heart of various abusive tax shelters and have contributed to the government\u2019s victory in the SCOTUS case US v. Gary Woods, allowing for the imposition of accuracy-related penalties in transactions lacking economic substance.\u00a0 His work has saved and will continue to save the government hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue, and has contributed to the development of the law in a manner that enhances the integrity and fairness of the federal tax system.\n\nTheJohn Marshall Award for Providing Legal Adviceis presented to the team responsible for in reviewing executive orders and attorney general orders for form and legality.\u00a0 Together, the recipients ensure that the orders are lawful and presented in proper form.\u00a0 They perform this daunting and critical task with supreme skill, integrity and care, and frequently on an extremely short timeline.\u00a0 Moreover, the team\u2019s behind-the-scenes work is critical to the integrity and success of every order the President of the United States or Attorney General signs.\u00a0 The recipients are, from the Office of Legal Counsel, Special CounselRosemary A. Hart, Senior CounselMatthew D. Robertsand Attorney-AdvisersMartine E. Cicconi,Kirti Datla,Nathan A. Forrester,Laura E. Heim,KelleyBrooke Hostetler,Jane E. Nitze,Annie L.

Welk.\n\nThis team is honored for its contributions to the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative through its civil forfeiture of bribe proceeds paid to the former President of the Republic of Korea, Chun Doo Hwan.\u00a0 After seizing power in 1979, Chun went on to earn a salary of approximately $20,000 per year from 1980 through 1988.\u00a0 When he was ultimately convicted of corruption crimes by South Korea in 1997, the trial court established that Chun had received more than $200 million in bribes during his presidency and ordered him to pay restitution in that amount.\u00a0 Stymied in their efforts to collect on Chun\u2019s restitution order, in 2013, Korean prosecutors turned to the department for assistance.\u00a0 Undaunted by the age of the evidence, the team pieced together financial and testimonial evidence sufficient to show that a portion of Chun\u2019s bribe proceeds were paid through intermediaries, transferred out of Korea in the names of shell corporations and ultimately invested into various properties in the United States.\u00a0 On Nov. 9, 2015, Attorney General Lynch celebrated the successful conclusion of this case by presenting the Korean Minister of Justice with an embossed copy of a forfeiture order and congratulating South Korea on having recovered more than $28.7 million as a result of the team\u2019s efforts.\n\nThis year\u2019sJohn Marshall Award for Alternative Dispute Resolutionis presented to the Crow Tribe Water Rights Settlement Team for the negotiation, defense and implementation of a settlement between the state of Montana, the Crow Nation and the United States that confirms the federal water rights of the Crow Nation arising from its 1868 treaty.\u00a0 The settlement, a decades-long effort, brings much-needed water, infrastructure and economic development to the Crow Reservation in Montana and allows the tribe to thrive on its reservation.\u00a0 The awardees are recognized for their creative and exemplary work in developing, negotiating and implementing a settlement approved by the Montana Legislature and subsequently ratified and altered by Congress.\u00a0 The team then defended the settlement in state and federal courts.\u00a0 Their work began with the negotiation of an agreement in the late 1990s, resolving contentious water rights issues as well as mineral severance taxation issues heard by SCOTUS.\u00a0 The team\u2019s successful completion of this extraordinary process makes clean drinking water, improved irrigation facilities and economic development opportunities available on the Crow Indian Reservation and confirms promises made to the Crow Nation in 1868.\n\nThe awardees are, from the Environment and Natural Resources Division\u2019s Indian Resources Section, Section ChiefS. Craig Alexander, Assistant Section ChiefDavid W. Harderand Trial AttorneyJ. Nathanael Watson; from the division\u2019s Law and Policy Section, Attorney-AdvisorStacy R. Stoller; from the division\u2019s Natural Resources Section, Trial AttorneyTyler G. Bair; and from the division\u2019s Appellate Section Trial AttorneyJohn L. Smeltzer.\n\nTheAttorney General\u2019s Award for Outstanding Contributions by a New Employeerecognizes exceptional performance and notable accomplishments towards the department\u2019s mission by an employee with fewer than five years of federal career service.\n\nThe first Outstanding Contributions by a New Employee Award is presented toCriminal Division Appellate Section AttorneyRoss B. Goldman.\u00a0 Goldman has proven himself to be an extraordinary and productive appellate advocate, who masterfully handles complex, large-record appeals.\u00a0 Although his cases have run the gamut from street crime to securities fraud, Goldman has brought his sophisticated analysis to two areas that bedevil the courts and prosecutors; insider trading, where he drafted a SCOTUS merits brief and a certiorari petition, and extraterritoriality, where, in one case, he defended the murder conviction of a Colombian national who murdered a DEA agent in Bogota and, in a second case, assisted the Solicitor General in formulating arguments on the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act\u2019s extraterritorial reach.\u00a0 He not only volunteers to take on extra work within the division, but he also seized the opportunity to review commutation applications filed by convicted drug traffickers because he believes so strongly in the Obama Administration\u2019s initiative to provide relief to nonviolent offenders who have already served significant prison terms.\u00a0 Finally, Goldman serves on the division\u2019s Diversity Committee and mentors a minority law student.\u00a0 He understands the department\u2019s mission writ large and he gives his best at all times.\n\nThe second Outstanding Contributions by a New Employee Award is presented to Special AgentAdebowale Babarinde Aladeof the FBI\u2019s San Antonio Field Office.\u00a0 Alade was the lead investigator on a 32-month complex criminal investigation targeting the Almighty Latin King Nation (ALKN), a violent transnational criminal enterprise operating in Texas with connections across the United States and overseas.\u00a0 With less than one year in the FBI, and still serving as a probationary agent, Alade demonstrated exceptional initiative by carefully exploiting human source information in early 2013, resulting in the identification of a key leader of the ALKN with control over operations in Texas.\u00a0 He determined that the ALKN was importing and distributing large quantities of narcotics from Mexico-based cartels, and was also involved in weapons trafficking with access to military-grade weapons and grenades.\u00a0 After obtaining Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces designation, Alade relentlessly pursued ALKN\u2019s illicit activities, ultimately targeting its command and control structure through the use of sophisticated techniques involving the interception of communications through Title III court orders.\u00a0 During 2014, Alade exploited intelligence derived from ALKN communications and human sources, and developed a cohesive interagency team by sharing information with law enforcement partners, resulting in a collaborative effort to target the ALKN.\u00a0 In October 2015, his work resulted in the indictment of 48 members of the ALKN, including its entire leadership structure in Texas, on RICO Act and drug conspiracy charges, as well as state drug violations.\u00a0 Alade subsequently led the multiagency enforcement operation that disrupted the ALKN, resulting in the seizure of narcotics and firearms, thousands of rounds of ammunition, cash, body armor, extensive digital devices and a wide array of ALKN paraphernalia.\u00a0 In conducting this investigation, Alade directly supported the department\u2019s mission by ensuring public safety against domestic and foreign threats, as well as providing leadership in preventing and controlling crime.",

            "article_text": "A federal jury convicted a New Jersey man for his involvement in a conspiracy to fraudulently obtain U.S. visas for Chinese government employees.\n\nAccording to court documents and evidence presented at trial, Zhongsan Liu, 59, of Fort Lee, participated in a scheme to fraudulently procure J-1 research scholar visas for employees of the government of the of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) to enable them to unlawfully work for the PRC government in the United States and to conceal that unlawful work from the United States and its agencies.\n\nLiu operated an office of the China Association for the International Exchange of Personnel (CAIEP), an agency of the PRC government, in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Among other activities, CAIEP engages in talent-recruitment for the benefit of the PRC, including recruiting U.S. scientists, academics, engineers and other experts to work in China.\n\nFrom 2017 up to and including September 2019, Liu worked with others to fraudulently procure J-1 research scholar visas for PRC government employees in order to enable those employees to unlawfully work for CAIEP in the United States and to conceal that unlawful work from the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security. The J-1 research scholar program permits foreign nationals to come to the United States for the primary purpose of conducting research at a corporate research facility, museum, library, university, or other research institution. Liu worked with others to obtain a J-1 research scholar visa for a prospective CAIEP employee, Sun Li, based on the false representation that Sun Li would conduct research at a U.S. university, and to conceal the unlawful work of another CAIEP employee, Liang Xiao, who was present in the United States on a J-1 visa sponsored by a U.S. university.\n\nIn or about April 2018, Liang Xiao applied for and received a J-1 visa to conduct research at that U.S. university. Although Liang represented to the U.S. government that she was entering the United States for the primary purpose of conducting research at the university, Liang\u2019s actual purpose in the United States consisted of working for CAIEP. Liu helped Liang take measures to enhance her false appearance as a research scholar by, among other things, directing Liang to report to the university upon her arrival in the United States; ensuring that Liang obtained a local driver\u2019s license and disguising Liang\u2019s CAIEP salary as a subsidy for a research scholar\u2019s living expenses.\n\nIn addition, Liu sought to enable Sun Li to obtain a J-1 research scholar visa under false pretenses. In particular, Liu reached out to contacts at multiple U.S. universities in order to arrange for a university to invite Sun Li to come to the United States as a J-1 research scholar. In truth and in fact, however, Liu intended that Li\u2019s primary purpose in the United States would consist of working for CAIEP.\n\nLiu was convicted of one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States and to commit visa fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of five years. He is scheduled to be sentenced on July 11. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams of the Southern District of New York, Assistant Director Alan E. Kohler Jr. of the FBI's Counterintelligence Division and Assistant Director in Charge Michael J. Driscoll of the FBI's New York Field Office made the announcement.\n\nThe FBI investigated the case, with valuable assistance provided by the U.S. Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, Homeland Security Investigations, and the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorneys Gillian Grossman and Elinor Tarlow for the Southern District of New York are prosecuting the case.",

            "article_text": "United States Attorney Richard G. Frohling announced today that Yue Liu, also known as Troy Liu (age: 41) of Mequon, Wisconsin, had been charged in a two-count information with wire fraud, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1343, and engaging in an unlawful monetary transaction, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1957. Liu has signed a plea agreement acknowledging that he is guilty of those charges.\n\nAs detailed in court documents, beginning in approximately April 2016 and continuing through at least November 2020, Liu, who was an engineering professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM), devised and executed a scheme to defraud. The essence of the scheme was to obtain money, through materially false promises and representations, from foreign students who were accepted into graduate programs at UWM. Liu promised foreign students that they would be part of a program run by an entity he controlled, which would pay expenses associated with their studies at UWM, including tuition and other costs. In reality, there was no such program affiliated with UWM, and UWM waived the students\u2019 tuition because they were research assistants. Liu emailed letters to students in which he made false representations about the program, and he wrote those letters using a fictitious name he invented and using what appeared to be a UWM logo.\n\nAccording to the Information and plea agreement, Liu fraudulently obtained more than $1.1 million from foreign students and visiting professors. Liu did not use the money from the students to pay their tuition and other expenses. Instead, he used a portion of the money he received for personal purposes, including to fund investment accounts and to pay credit card expenses. Liu also attempted to conceal the scheme by creating a fraudulent research agreement between UWM and a fictitious entity purportedly based in China and using a portion of the money to fund this agreement.\n\nThe wire fraud count carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, a maximum fine of $250,000, and up to five years of supervised release following any prison term. The unlawful monetary transaction count carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, a maximum fine of $250,000, and up to three years of supervised release.\n\nThe claims made in the Information are allegations that, if the case were to proceed to trial, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt to convict the defendant. The plea agreement expresses the defendant\u2019s intention to plead guilty, but the defendant has not yet formally entered a plea in this matter.\n\nThis matter was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Criminal Investigation Division of the Internal Revenue Service, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement of the Department of Homeland Security. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney John P. Scully.\n\n# #\u00a0 #\n\nFor further information contact:Kenneth.Gales@usdoj.gov\n\n(414) 297-1700\n\nFollow us on Twitter\n\n\n\n",

Qin was also ordered to pay a fine of $20,000 and will face deportation proceedings upon completion of his sentence.\n\nOn April 28, 2021, Qin pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to unlawfully export items from the United States to NWPU without first obtaining the required export licenses; one count of visa fraud; two counts of making false statements to law enforcement agents regarding his customers and the types of parts he caused to be exported from the United States to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC); four counts of money laundering; and two counts of smuggling hydrophones from the U.S. to the PRC.\n\nQin established LinkOcean Technologies, LTD., which he used to import goods and technology with underwater and marine applications into the PRC from the United States, Canada and Europe. NWPU has been involved in the development of unmanned aerial vehicles, autonomous underwater vehicles and missile proliferation projects. Since 2001, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) has designated NWPU on its Entity List for national security reasons. Between approximately July 2015 and December 2016, Qin caused at least 60 hydrophones (devices used to detect and monitor sound underwater) to be exported from the United States to NWPU without obtaining the required export licenses from the DOC. Qin and his company, LinkOcean, did so by concealing from the U.S. manufacturer of the hydrophones that NWPU was the true end-user and by causing false end-user information to be filed with the U.S. government. In addition, on four occasions in connection with the export of hydrophones to NWPU, Qin transferred more than $100,000 from Chinese bank accounts to bank accounts located in the United States with the intent to promote and facilitate his unlawful export scheme.\n\nAdditionally, in July 2016, Qin engaged in visa fraud in connection with his application to remove conditions on his U.S. Permanent Resident Status by falsely certifying that he had not committed any crime for which he was not arrested since becoming a conditional permanent resident when, in fact, he had caused the illegal export of hydrophones from the United States to NWPU in December 2015.\n\nQin also made false statements to federal agents on two occasions regarding LinkOcean\u2019s customers and its export activities. Specifically, during a November 2017 interview with Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Officers, Qin falsely stated that he only exported instruments that attach to a buoy. However, Qin had exported and caused the export of remotely-operated side scan sonar systems, unmanned underwater vehicles, unmanned surface vehicles, robotic boats and hydrophones. The items that Qin concealed from CBP during this interview have military applications and several of these items were delivered to military end-users in China. For instance, Qin exported a U.S.-manufactured remotely-operated side scan sonar system to a PLA Troop in November 2015. On or about July 21, 2018, Qin lied to investigators during an interview when he stated that he did not have any customers on the DOC\u2019s Entity List. In fact, Qin had at least two such customers \u2013 NWPU and the National University of Defense Technology (NUDT). NUDT is involved in national defense research for the PLA and responsible for modernizing the PRC\u2019s armed forces. Since 2015, it has been designated on DOC\u2019s Entity List.\n\nPrior to entering his guilty plea in this case, Qin moved to suppress evidence seized from his laptop and iPhone and statements he made to CBP officers during a secondary inspection upon his return to the United States from the PRC at Logan Airport in November 2017. After eight days of evidentiary hearings, Judge Casper found that the \u201cChinese Navy\u201d was one of Qin\u2019s customers according to LinkOcean\u2019s website. At the time of the search, agents testified that they were \u201cconcerned that Qin was involved [in] working on behalf of the Chinese Navy to procure items from the United States, export them to China so that they could be used or incorporated in systems the Chinese Navy or research institutes were developing to be used in electronic warfare, anti-submarine warfare.\u201d Judge Casper further found that by the end of the summer of 2017, investigators had learned that Qin was interested in procuring both AUVs and sonobuoys, which raised concerns for the agents as they learned that Ultra Electronics was at that same time developing \u201can AUV that worked in conjunction with [a] sonobuoy \u2026 strictly for military use by the U.S. Navy.\u201d Qin also lied when questioned about the types of parts he exported, concealing his \u201cinterest in procuring side scan sonar systems, AUVs and sonobuoys.\u201d\n\nActing U.S. Attorney Mendell; Acting Assistant Attorney General Mark J. Lesko for the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division; Matthew B.

            "article_text": "WASHINGTON - Kexue Huang, aka John, 45, has been arrested and charged in a 17-count indictment with economic espionage intended to benefit a foreign government and instrumentalities, and interstate and foreign transportation of stolen property, announced Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Timothy M. Morrison for the Southern District of Indiana.\n\nHuang was arrested on July 13, 2010, in Westborough, Mass., by FBI agents, and today made his initial appearance in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. According to the indictment, Huang is a Chinese national who was granted legal permanent resident status in the United States. The indictment alleges that Huang, formerly of Carmel, Ind., misappropriated and transported trade secrets and property to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) while working as a research scientist at Dow AgroSciences LLC (Dow). While he was employed at Dow, he then directed university researchers in the PRC to further develop the Dow trade secrets. He also allegedly applied for and obtained grant funding that was used to develop the stolen trade secrets.\n\n\"Economic espionage robs our businesses and inventors of hard-earned, protected research,\u00a0and is particularly harmful when the theft of these ideas is meant to benefit a foreign government,\" said Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division.\u00a0 \"The protection of trade secrets and all intellectual property is vital to the economic success of our country,\u00a0and our leadership in innovation.\u00a0\u00a0We will continue to bring charges under the Economic Espionage Act wherever supported by the evidence.\"\n\n\"Complex cases like this one, where the challenge of highly technical evidence is compounded by geography, require extraordinary cooperation and flexibility between all components of the investigation,\" said U.S. Attorney Timothy M. Morrison.\u00a0 \"We had that here.\"\n\nAccording to the indictment, Dow is a leading agricultural company that provides agrochemical and biotechnology products. Since approximately 1989, Dow has made substantial investments in research and development to produce a class of organic insect control and management products. A proprietary fermentation process has been used to develop these organic insecticides.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Huang was employed as a Dow research scientist from early 2003 until Feb. 29, 2008. As a Dow employee, Huang signed an agreement that outlined his obligations in handling confidential information, including trade secrets, and prohibited him from disclosing any confidential information without Dow\u2019s consent. Dow employed several layers of security to preserve and maintain confidentiality and to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of its trade secrets.\n\nIn December 2008, Huang allegedly published an article without Dow\u2019s authorization through Hunan Normal University (HNU) in the PRC, which contained Dow trade secrets. The article allegedly was based on work supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), a foreign instrumentality of the PRC. Huang also allegedly directed individuals associated with HNU to conduct research at their laboratories on Dow trade secrets. The indictment also alleges that beginning in March 2008, after leaving Dow, Huang applied for and ultimately received grants from NSFC which he used to develop Dow trade secrets.\n\nThe indictment also alleges that beginning as early as September 2007, Huang directed research in the PRC on Dow confidential information, including trade secrets, which he was assigned to research in the course of his Dow employment. In addition, the indictment alleges that Huang sought information about manufacturing facilities in the PRC that would allow him and others to compete in the same market as Dow.\n\nHuang faces a maximum of 15 years in prison and a $500,000 fine on each of the 12 counts of economic espionage. He faces 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine on each of the five counts of transportation of stolen property.\n\nThe case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Cynthia J. Ridgeway of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Indiana as well as Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark L. Krotoski and Trial Attorney Evan C. Williams of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS). The National Security Division provided assistance in this matter. The investigation is being conducted by the FBI. Significant assistance in the case has also been provided by the CCIPS Cybercrime Lab.\n\nThe charges contained in the indictment are merely allegations, and the defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty.",

            "article_text": "The Justice Department today announced criminal charges in five cases from four U.S. Attorney\u2019s offices in connection with the multi-agency Disruptive Technology Strike Force (Strike Force).\n\nThe Strike Force is co-led by the Departments of Justice and Commerce to counter efforts by hostile nation states to illicitly acquire sensitive U.S. technology to advance their authoritarian regimes and facilitate human rights abuses. Launched in February 2023, the Strike Force\u2019s work has led to the unsealing of charges against 34 defendants in 24 cases involving alleged export control violations, smuggling, theft of trade secrets, and other charges by actors connected to Russia, China, and Iran.\n\nThe cases announced today took place over the course of multiple weeks, culminating in the arrest today of a Russian national allegedly seeking to illegally export electronics for use in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to Russia. The other cases also cover spearfishing of U.S-based scientists by an employee of a state-owned Chinese defense company and the smuggling of laser welding machines used in nuclear munition production to Russia.\n\n\u201cThe prosecutions of these cases under the Disruptive Technology Strike Force reflects the joint efforts of five agencies across the government focused on the shared goal of stopping the transfer of sensitive, cutting-edge technologies to Iran, China, and Russia,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department's National Security Division. \u201cThe Justice Department, through the work of the Strike Force, will continue to do all we can to prevent advanced technologies from falling into the hands of our adversaries and protect our national security.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe launched the Disruptive Technology Strike Force a year and half ago to advance the vital mission of safeguarding U.S. technology,\u201d said Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement Matthew S. Axelrod of the U.S. Department of Commerce. \u201cAs today\u2019s announcements make clear, our efforts to protect sensitive U.S. technologies \u2013 which to date have yielded 24 publicly charged criminal cases, millions of dollars in administrative penalties, and multiple Entity List additions \u2013 remain relentless and unyielding.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that the threats we face today are more complex and severe than ever before,\u201d\u00a0said Executive Assistant Director Robert Wells of the FBI\u2019s National Security Branch.\u00a0\u201cThe best way \u2013 and the only way \u2013 we can stay ahead of current and emerging threats is by working together. With these indictments, the Disruptive Technology Strike Force is an excellent example of the power of partnerships in practice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose who facilitate the illegal proliferation of sensitive technologies and material to hostile nations and terrorist groups pose a serious threat to the safety and security of the United States,\u201d said Executive Associate Director Katrina W. Berger of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). \u201cHSI is committed to working with our partners to disrupt and dismantle the criminal networks that aid and abed U.S. adversaries.\u201d\n\n\u201cDisrupting the efforts of foreign nations, international criminal organizations, and other potentially hostile entities that seek to illegally obtain sensitive DoD technology and weapon systems that could potentially be used against our military forces remains a top priority of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the criminal investigative arm of Department of Defense (DoD) Office of Inspector General,\u201d said Inspector General Robert P. Storch of DoD. \u201cWe will continue to work with the Justice Department and our strike force partners to thwart the efforts of criminal elements whose activities threaten the security of the United States.\u201d\n\nUnited States v. Postovoy (District of Columbia)\n\nA federal grand jury returned a seven-countindictmentcharging Denis Postovoy, a Russian citizen living in the United States, with conspiring to violate the Export Control Reform Act, commit smuggling, commit money laundering and defraud the United States. HSI arrested Postovoy this morning in Sarasota, Florida.\n\nAccording to court documents, beginning in at least February 2022, following Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Postovoy procured and illicitly exported from the United States to Russia microelectronic components with military applications. The exported microelectronics can be used in UAVs or drones. Through a web of companies that he owns or operates in Russia, Hong Kong, and elsewhere, Postovoy and individuals in his network purchased the microelectronics from U.S.-based distributors and exported them to Russia without the required licenses from the Department of Commerce.\n\nAs alleged, Postovoy\u2019s companies included WowCube HK Limited, JST Group Hong Kong, Jove HK Limited, all based in Hong Kong, and the Vector Group in Russia. Postovoy repeatedly concealed and misstated the true end users and end destinations of the microelectronics by submitting false information on export-related documents. He transshipped items that were ultimately destined for Russia through intermediary destinations, including Hong Kong, Switzerland and elsewhere, and received payments in U.S. dollars from foreign bank accounts. His companies transferred funds for the purchase and shipment of the goods through bank accounts in Hong Kong, Russia, and elsewhere to bank accounts in the United States, including bank accounts maintained by the U.S. suppliers of microelectronics and other sensitive technologies.\n\nHSI is investigating the case.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Stuart Allen for the District of Columbia and Trial Attorney Sean Heiden of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting the case.\n\nUnited States v. Song Wu (Northern District of Georgia)\n\nToday, a federal court in Atlanta, unsealed anindictmentcharging Chinese national, Song Wu, 39, with wire fraud and aggravated identity theft arising from his efforts to fraudulently obtain computer software and source code created by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), research universities, and private companies. Song remains at large.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Song allegedly engaged in a multi-year \u201cspear phishing\u201d email campaign in which he created email accounts to impersonate U.S.-based researchers and engineers and then used those imposter accounts to obtain specialized restricted or proprietary software used for aerospace engineering and computational fluid dynamics. This specialized software could be used for industrial and military applications, such as development of advanced tactical missiles and aerodynamic design and assessment of weapons.\n\nIn executing the scheme, Song allegedly sent spear phishing emails to individuals employed in positions with the U.S. government, including NASA, the Air Force, Navy, and Army, and the Federal Aviation Administration. Song also sent spear phishing emails to individuals employed in positions with major research universities in Georgia, Michigan, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Ohio, and with private sector companies that work in the aerospace field. Song\u2019s spear phishing emails appeared to the targeted victims as having been sent by a colleague, associate, friend, or other person in the research or engineering community. His emails requested that the targeted victim send or make available source code or software to which Song believed the targeted victim had access.\n\nAccording to the indictment, while conducting this spear phishing campaign, Song was employed as an engineer at Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), a Chinese state-owned aerospace and defense conglomerate headquartered in Beijing. AVIC manufactures civilian and military aircrafts and is one of the largest defense contractors in the world.\n\nIn total, Song is charged with 14 counts of wire fraud and 14 counts of aggravated identity theft. If convicted, Song faces a maximum statutory penalty of 20 years in prison for each count of wire fraud. Song also faces a mandatory, two-year consecutive penalty in prison for aggravated identity theft. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nThe FBI and the NASA\u2019s Office of Inspector General are investigating the case.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Samir Kaushal for the Northern District of Georgia and Trial Attorney Tanner Kroeger of the National Security Division's Cyber Section are prosecuting the case with assistance from the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.\n\nUnited States v. Teslenko (District of Massachusetts)\n\nMassachusetts resident, Samer Bhambhani, 55, and Russian national, Maksim Teslenko, 35, have beenchargedwith smuggling and one count of conspiracy to violate and evade export controls, commit smuggling, and defraud the United States. Bhambhani was arrested on Sept. 9 and was released on conditions following an initial appearance in federal court in Boston. Teslenko remains at large overseas.\n\nIt is alleged that from in or around 2015 through at least 2021, Bhambhani and Teslenko conspired to export laser welding machines from Bhambhani\u2019s employer in the United States to the Ural Electromechanical Plant (UEMZ) in Yekaterinburg, Russia, while falsifying the export documentation submitted to the U.S. government in order to conceal the fact that the UEMZ was the true end user of the machines. The UEMZ is a subsidiary of Rosatom, a Russian state corporation headquartered in Moscow, that oversaw Russia\u2019s civilian and military nuclear program. According to the indictment, Teslenko knew that the laser welding machines were intended for the portion of the UEMZ involving the Russian nuclear weapons program.\n\nThe charge of smuggling provides for a sentence of up to 10 years in prison, three years supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000. The charge of conspiracy provides for a sentence of up to five years in prison, three years supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorneys Timothy H. Kistner and Laura S. Kaplan for the District of Massachusetts and Trial Attorney Sean O\u2019Dowd of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting the case.\n\nUnited States v. Goodarzi (Southern District of Texas)\n\nGholam Reza Goodarzi, also known as Ron Goodarzi, 76, a dual U.S. and Iranian citizen who resides in Porter, Texas, was arrested at the George Bush International Airport on Aug. 30 based on a criminal complaint alleging he smuggled parts and components used in the production of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), as well as other manned aircraft, from the United States to Iran.\n\nAccording to court documents, from December 1, 2020, through July 5, Goodarzi illegally exported aircraft-related parts, in addition to oil and drilling components, to Iran. As alleged, Goodarzi purchased U.S.-origin aircraft components from U.S.-based suppliers and then exported them to Iran \u2013 typically through Dubai, UAE. He also traveled to and from Iran multiple times per year and concealed aircraft parts and other items in his checked luggage. Goodarzi exchanged multiple emails with suppliers and customers, acknowledging that parts could not be shipped to Iran because of sanctions.\n\nThe complaint alleges that on several occasions, authorities searched Goodarzi\u2019s luggage and found numerous aircraft parts and components hidden within articles of clothing. Some of the items had characteristics consistent with parts for the production of UAVs, as well as parts with electrical motor and generator applications. Goodarzi does not have the required licenses to export such items to sanctioned countries, including Iran, according to the complaint.\n\nThe FBI, with assistance from and Customs and Border Protection, is investigating the case.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Heather Winter for the Southern District of Texas and Trial Attorney Christopher Cook of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting the case.\n\nUnited States v. Nader (District of Columbia)\n\nU.S.-Iranian nationalJeffrey Chance Nader, 66, of Arcadia, California, was arrested on Aug. 13, 2024, based on an indictment charging him with crimes related to the procurement of U.S.-manufactured aircraft components, including components used on military aircraft, in violation of U.S. economic sanctions and other federal laws.\n\nAccording to the indictment, beginning at least in 2023, Nader and others conspired to purchase and export \u2013 and attempted to export \u2013 from the United States to Iran four types of aircraft components, totaling nearly three dozen individual pieces. Some of these components are for use on military aircraft operated by Iran\u2019s armed forces, including the F-4 fighter jet.\n\nNader, acting on purchase orders he received from customers in Iran, would coordinate the purchase of relevant aircraft components with business associates in Iran, by which they would reach out to U.S.-based suppliers of such components. In several instances, Nader identified himself and his company, California-based Pro Aero Capital, to these U.S.-based suppliers as the end-user of these items. Victim companies in this procurement scheme were located across the United States.\n\nOnce the aircraft components were obtained, Nader attempted to export the items on multiple separate occasions. The items were then transshipped to the ultimate customer in Iran. None of the transactions discussed in the indictment were successfully exported; they were detained on export by a Special Agent with the Department of Commerce.\n\nThis case is being investigated by the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office and the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security. Significant assistance was provided by the FBI\u2019s Los Angeles Field Office.\n\nThe case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Steven B. Wasserman for the District of Columbia and Trial Attorney Sean Heiden of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section. Significant assistance was provided by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California.\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\n\nToday\u2019s actions were coordinated through the Justice and Commerce Departments\u2019 Disruptive Technology Strike Force. The Disruptive Technology Strike Force is an interagency law enforcement strike force co-led by the Departments of Justice and Commerce designed to target illicit actors, protect supply chains and prevent critical technology from being acquired by authoritarian regimes and hostile nation states.\u00a0 ThePostovoyandTeslenkoinvestigations were also coordinated through the Justice Department\u2019s Task Force KleptoCapture, an interagency law enforcement task force dedicated to enforcing sanctions, export controls and economic countermeasures imposed in response to Russia\u2019s unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine.\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\n\nAlso today, the Department is announcing the unsealing of anindictmentin Chicago, Illinois, charging Chinese national Jia Wei with unlawfully accessing the computer network of a U.S. communications company to steal proprietary information for the benefit of the China-based entities.\n\nAs alleged, Wei was a member of the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA), the military of the People\u2019s Republic of China, and assigned to a PLA unit tasked with obtaining communications and information of third parties through computer hacking. In March 2017, Wei and his co-conspirators accessed the U.S. company\u2019s network without authorization approximately two days after the U.S. company filed a civil action against a China-based competitor for theft of communication-device trade secrets. Through this unauthorized access, Wei and his co-conspirators stole U.S. company documents relating to, among other things, the company\u2019s civilian and military communication devices, product development, testing plans, internal product evaluations and commercial information about competitors. These documents pertained to some of the same technology and information that the China-based competitor stole from the U.S. company, as alleged in the civil action. In addition, Wei and his co-conspirators stole documents from the U.S. company discussing the China-based competitor.\n\nDuring his unauthorized access, Wei and his co-conspirators attempted to install malicious software designed to provide persistent unauthorized access to the U.S. company\u2019s network. Wei\u2019s unauthorized access continued until approximately late May 2017.\n\nThe six-count indictment, returned in March 2022, charges Wei with wire fraud, conspiracy to commit computer intrusions, computer intrusions and aggravated identity theft. A warrant for his arrest has been issued. If convicted, Wei faces a maximum statutory penalty of 20 years in prison for each wire fraud count, five years in prison for each of the conspiracy and computer intrusion counts, and a mandatory, two-year consecutive penalty in prison for each aggravated identity theft count. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nThe FBI Chicago Field Office is investigating the case.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorneys Melody Wells, Steven Dollear and Thomas Peabody for the Northern District of Illinois and Trial Attorney Brett Reynolds of the National Security Division are prosecuting the case. Significant assistance was provided by the National Security Division\u2019s National Security Cyber Section.\n\nAn indictment, complaint or criminal information is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.\n\nNote:This press release was updated on Sept. 16, 2024, to include two additional cases.",

            "article_text": "Hao Zhang, 41, of China, was found guilty of economic espionage, theft of trade secrets, and conspiring to commit both offenses today, announced the Department of Justice. \u00a0The ruling was handed down by the Honorable Edward J. Davila, U.S. District Judge, following a four-day bench trial.\n\nEvidence submitted during the course of the trial demonstrated that from 2010 to 2015, Zhang conspired to and did steal trade secrets from two companies: Avago, a designer, developer, and global supplier of a broad range of analog, digital, mixed signal and optoelectronics components and subsystems with a focus in semiconductor design and processing, headquartered in San Jose, California, and Singapore; and Skyworks, an innovator of high performance analog semiconductors headquartered in Woburn, Massachusetts. \u00a0Judge Davila found that Zhang intended to steal the trade secrets for the benefit of the People\u2019s Republic of China\n\n\u201cThe defendant plotted with Tianjin University to take trade secrets from two U.S. companies, including his own employer, to China for the benefit of the Chinese Government,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers.\u00a0 \u201cToday\u2019s guilty verdict on all counts is an important step in holding accountable an individual who robbed his U.S. employer of trade secrets and sought to replicate the company\u2019s technology and replace its market share.\u00a0 The Department of Justice\u2019s commitment to prosecuting these cases should serve as a cautionary tale to anyone considering doing the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cA free nation is naturally innovative.\u00a0 No nation is more innovative than the United States.\u00a0 Countries without freedom cannot match our innovation, and inevitably must resort to theft.\u00a0 Theft is not innovation.\u00a0 By combatting theft, we protect innovation and freedom,\u201d said U.S. Attorney David L. Anderson for the Northern District of California.\n\n\u201cEconomic Espionage is a pervasive threat throughout the United States, particularly to the San Francisco Bay Area and Silicon Valley which is the center of innovation and technology,\u201d said FBI Special Agent in Charge John F. Bennett.\u00a0 \u201cWhile this case exemplifies how easily a few motivated employees can conspire to misappropriate intellectual property for the benefit of the People\u2019s Republic of China, Zhang\u2019s conviction should serve as a warning to our adversaries that the FBI and our partners remain committed to aggressively investigating and prosecuting these crimes.\u201d\n\nAccording evidence presented during the bench trial, Zhang stole trade secrets relating the performance of wireless devices.\u00a0 Specifically, Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) and Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW) filters are used in wireless devices to eliminate interference and improve other aspects of device performance.\u00a0 Film Bulk Acoustic Resonators (FBAR) are one type of BAW filter.\u00a0 The most common and most profitable application of FBAR technology is as a radio frequency (RF) filter for mobile phones and other wireless devices.\u00a0 Technological advances in FBARs have played a substantial role in creating smaller, more efficient wireless devices for both consumer and military applications.\u00a0 Avago, one of the victims of Zhang\u2019s theft, was the leading company in the United States manufacturing and selling FBARs.\u00a0 Zhang\u2019s other victim, Skyworks, was developing its own BAW technology.\n\nEvidence at trial further showed that in October 2006, Zhang and his co-conspirators started a business in China to compete with Avago and Skyworks.\u00a0 One of Zhang\u2019s co-conspirators, Wei Pang, started working at Avago at the same time. \u00a0Zhang and Pang illicitly shared trade secrets with each other and with co-conspirators in China while they worked for the U.S. companies. \u00a0Zhang and Pang then connected their venture to Tianjin University (TJU) in China, an instrumentality of the Chinese government. \u00a0By 2009, they left their work in the United States to relocate to China, following a plan laid out by TJU officials to form another company, Novana, in the Cayman Islands. \u00a0Along the way, Zhang obtained patents in his own name using trade secret information he knew was stolen from Avago. \u00a0Zhang also worked with stolen trade secrets in a lab he founded at TJU while developing his new FBAR business. The FBAR processes that Zhang and his co-conspirators stole took Avago over twenty years of research and development to build.\u00a0 Additional evidence during the bench trial demonstrated that Zhang engaged in economic espionage to help TJU and Zhang\u2019s Chinese company unfairly compete in the multi-billion dollar global market for cell phone RF filters.\n\nZhang was charged in a superseding indictment returned by a federal grand jury on April 1, 2015.\n\nZhang is currently released on a $500,000 secured bond.\n\nZhang\u2019s sentencing hearing is scheduled for Aug. 31, 2020, before Judge Davila in San San Jose.\u00a0 The maximum statutory penalty for each count in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01831 is 15 years in custody and a fine of $250,000, plus restitution if appropriate.\u00a0 The maximum statutory penalty for each count in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01832 is 10 years in custody and a fine of $250,000, plus restitution if appropriate.\u00a0 However, any sentence will be imposed by the court after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553.\n\nMichelle J. Kane and Susan Knight are the Assistant U.S. Attorneys who are prosecuting the case with the assistance of Rebecca Shelton, Susan Kreider, and Laurie Worthen.\u00a0 The prosecution is the result of an investigation by the FBI.",

            "article_text": "A federal jury today convicted Yanjun Xu, a Chinese national and Deputy Division Director of the Sixth Bureau of the Jiangsu Province Ministry of State Security, of conspiring to and attempting to commit economic espionage and theft of trade secrets. The defendant is the first Chinese intelligence officer to be extradited to the United States to stand trial.\n\n\u201cThis conviction of a card-carrying intelligence officer for economic espionage underscores that trade secret theft is integral to the PRC government\u2019s plans to modernize its industries,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division. \u201cBut this conviction also serves notice that the United States will not sit by as China, or any other nation-state, attempts to steal instead of researching and developing key technology. Instead, and with the support of our allies, we will continue to investigate, prosecute, and hold accountable those who try to take the fruits of American ingenuity illegally.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe jury, by its guilty verdict here today, held Xu accountable for his classic spy techniques,\u201d said Acting U.S. Attorney Vipal J. Patel for the Southern District of Ohio. \u201cXu conspired to commit economic espionage on behalf of the Chinese government, and he tried to steal the valuable innovation and trade secrets of industry-leading American aviation technology companies. This office will continue to seek to protect American innovation and hold accountable those who attempt to steal our nation\u2019s science and technology, regardless of status or affiliation, whether civilian, military or spy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was state-sponsored economic espionage by the PRC designed to steal American technology and put Americans out of work,\u201d said Assistant Director Alan E. Kohler Jr. of the FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Division. \u201cFor those who doubt the real goals of the PRC, this should be a wakeup call; they are stealing American technology to benefit their economy and military. The FBI is partnering with over 50 U.S. Government agencies to share information and investigative resources to stop the PRC\u2019s illegal activities.\u201d\n\nAccording to court documents and evidence presented at trial, beginning in at least December 2013, Xu used multiple aliases to target specific companies in the United States and abroad that are recognized as leaders in the field of aviation. He identified experts who worked for the companies and recruited them to travel to China, often initially under the guise that they were traveling to give a presentation at a university. Xu and others paid the experts stipends on top of covering travel costs. According to today\u2019s conviction, Xu attempted to steal technology related to GE Aviation\u2019s exclusive composite aircraft engine fan \u2013 which no other company in the world has been able to duplicate \u2013 to benefit the Chinese state.\n\nIn March 2017, a GE Aviation employee in Cincinnati, Ohio, was solicited to give a report at a university in China. The employee traveled to China two months later to present at the university and was introduced to Xu. Xu and others paid the employee\u2019s travel expenses and a stipend.\n\nIn January 2018, Xu requested \u201csystem specification, design process\u201d information from the employee and \u2013 with the cooperation of the company, who was working with the FBI \u2013 the employee emailed a two-page document from the company that included a label that warned about the disclosure of proprietary information.\n\nIn February 2018, Xu began discussing with the employee the possibility of meeting in Europe during one of the employee\u2019s business trips and asked the employee to send a copy of the file directory for his company-issued computer.\n\nXu traveled to Belgium on April 1, 2018, to meet with the employee and was arrested at that time.\n\nXu was convicted of two counts of conspiring and attempting to commit economic espionage, which carries a maximum statutory penalty of 15 years in prison for each count and a fine of up to $5 million. Xu was also convicted of conspiracy to commit trade secret theft and two counts of attempted theft of trade secrets, which carries a maximum statutory sentence of 10 years in prison for each count and a $250,000 fine. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nThe FBI investigated the case.\n\nAssistant Deputy Criminal Chief Timothy S. Mangan and Deputy Criminal Chief Emily Glatfelter for the Southern District of Ohio and Trial Attorney Matthew J. McKenzie of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting the case.\n\nThe Criminal Division\u2019s Office of International Affairs secured Xu\u2019s extradition to the United States, with valuable assistance provided by the government of Belgium and the Belgian Federal Police.",

            "article_text": "HOUSTON \u2013 A criminal complaint has been unsealed charging a 53-year-old College Station man for conspiracy, making false statements and wire fraud.\n\nTexas A&M University (TAMU) Professor Zhengdong Cheng is expected to make his initial appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge Sam Sheldon today at 2 p.m. in Houston. Authorities took him into custody Sunday, Aug. 23.\n\nCheng allegedly led a team conducting research for NASA. According to the criminal complaint, for several years he willfully took steps to obscure his affiliations and collaboration with a Chinese University and at least one Chinese-owned company. The terms of Cheng\u2019s grant prohibited participation, collaboration or coordination with China, any Chinese-owned company or any Chinese University, according to the charges.\n\n\u201cChina is building an economy and academic institutions with bricks stolen from others all around the world,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Patrick. \u201cWhile 1.4 million foreign researchers and academics are here in the U.S. for the right reasons, the Chinese Talents Program exploits our open and free universities. These conflicts must be disclosed, and we will hold those accountable when such conflict violates the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce again we have witnessed the criminal conflicts that can arise from participation in the Chinese government\u2019s talent program,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers. \u201cProfessor Cheng allegedly made false statements to his university and to NASA regarding his affiliations with the Chinese government. The Department of Justice will continue seeking to illuminate the darkness around these talent programs and expose the exploitation of our nation and our prized research institutions.\u201d\n\nThe charges allege Cheng and TAMU received funds based on Cheng knowingly providing false information to TAMU and consequently to NASA. In addition to the funds, Cheng personally benefited from his affiliation with TAMU and NASA with increased access to unique NASA resources, such as the International Space Station, according to the complaint. This access allegedly allowed Cheng to further his standing in China at Guangdong University of Technology and other universities. The charges further allege he held senior research positions there unknown to TAMU and NASA and was able to serve in the People\u2019s Republic of China Talents program.\n\nChina\u2019s Talents Plans are allegedly designed to attract, recruit and cultivate high-level scientific talent in furtherance of China\u2019s scientific development, economic prosperity and national security.\n\n\u201cNASA\u2019s funding restrictions are in place to protect taxpayer-financed research dollars and intellectual property,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Mark Zielinski, NASA Office of Inspector General (OIG) - Eastern Field Office. \u201cWe will continue pursue anyone who attempts to circumvent these guidelines and conceal affiliations with Chinese institutions and companies in order to obtain NASA grant money.\u201d\n\n\u201cDr. Cheng is accused of hiding his affiliation with the Guangdong University of Technology, along with other foreign universities, while disregarding the rules established under his NASA contract during his employment at TAMU,\u201d said FBI Houston Special Agent in Charge Perrye K. Turner. \u201cThese alleged actions came to light through the tireless work of the FBI-Bryan Resident Agency and NASA-OIG investigative teams. We are grateful to TAMU, TAMU System and TAMU Engineering Experiment Station for providing significant assistance through their partnership with us throughout this case.\u201d\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorneys Carolyn Ferko and S. Mark McIntyre are prosecuting the case with the assistance of trial attorney Matthew McKenzie of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.\n\nA criminal complaint is a formal accusation of criminal conduct, not evidence.

            "article_text": "CINCINNATI \u2013 The first Chinese government intelligence officer ever to be extradited to the United States to stand trial was sentenced today in federal court in Cincinnati.\n\n\n\nYanjun Xu was sentenced to 20 years in prison.\n\n\n\nXu targeted American aviation companies, recruited employees to travel to China, and solicited their proprietary information, all on behalf of China.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis case sends a clear message: we will hold accountable anyone attempting to steal American trade secrets,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Kenneth L. Parker. \u201cXu conspired to steal American science and technology. Thanks to the diligent work of the FBI, GE Aviation, and our trial team, he\u2019ll spend decades in federal prison.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe historic sentencing of a Chinese government official for committing espionage against the U.S. is a significant achievement and also should serve as a warning to foreign governments that the U.S. will not tolerate this type of illegal activity,\u201d stated FBI Cincinnati Special Agent in Charge J. William Rivers. \u201cThe FBI and our partners will continue to investigate and prosecute those who attempt to steal the sophisticated technologies of U.S. companies, our military, and our government.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn Nov. 5, 2021, a federal jury in Cincinnati convicted Xu on all counts: conspiracy to commit economic espionage, conspiracy to commit trade secret theft, attempted economic espionage and attempted trade secret theft.\n\n\n\nXu was a career intelligence officer, beginning in 2003 and rising to the rank of deputy division director at the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS), the intelligence and security agency for China.\n\n\n\nAccording to court documents and trial testimony, beginning in at least December 2013, Xu targeted specific companies in the United States and abroad that are recognized as leaders in the field of aviation.\n\n\n\nXu used aliases, front companies and universities to deceive aviation employees and solicit information. He identified individuals who worked for the companies and recruited them to travel to China, often initially under the guise that they were traveling to give a presentation at a university. Xu and others paid the individuals stipends on top of covering travel costs.\n\n\n\nThe scheme was executed with full coordination between the MSS and China\u2019s aviation entities. Xu worked with others in the MSS to hack or copy computers in hotel rooms while the aviation employees \u2013 his \u201cguests\u201d \u2013 were taken to dinner by the MSS.\n\n\n\nXu also openly talked about efforts to obtain U.S. military information in addition to commercial aviation trade secrets.\n\n\n\nAttempted GE Aviation trade secret theft\n\nXu attempted to steal technology related to GE Aviation\u2019s exclusive composite aircraft engine fan module \u2013 which no other company in the world has been able to duplicate \u2013 to benefit the Chinese state.\n\n\n\nIn March 2017, a GE Aviation employee in Cincinnati was solicited to give a report at a university in China. The employee traveled to China two months later to present at the university and was introduced to Xu. Xu and others paid the employee\u2019s travel expenses and a stipend.\n\n\n\nAfter the trip to China, the FBI took over communications with Xu, posing as the employee.\n\n\n\nIn January 2018, Xu requested \u201csystem specification, design process\u201d information from the employee and \u2013 with the cooperation of GE Aviation, who was working with the FBI \u2013 the employee emailed a two-page document from the company that included a label that warned about the disclosure of proprietary information.\n\n\n\nIn February 2018, Xu began discussing with the employee the possibility of meeting in Europe during one of the employee\u2019s business trips and asked the employee to send a copy of the file directory for his company-issued computer.\n\n\n\nXu traveled to Belgium with cash and pictures of the employee on April 1, 2018. He was scheduled to meet with the employee and was arrested at that time.\n\n\n\nThe Department of Justice Criminal Division\u2019s Office of International Affairs secured Xu\u2019s extradition to the United States, with valuable assistance provided by the government of Belgium, as well as the Belgian Federal Police.\n\n\n\nHandling of MSS spy in Chicago\n\nIn September 2022, a federal jury in Chicago convicted an individual (Ji Chaoqun) for working on behalf of the MSS under the direction of Xu.\n\n\n\nXu served as Ji\u2019s MSS handler while Ji, a Chinese citizen, lived and studied in Chicago. Xu officially registered Ji as a formal MSS overseas agent in January 2014 and directed Ji to collect biographical information on people to potentially recruit to work with them.\n\n\n\nXu provided Ji with the names of at least nine individuals in America to attempt to recruit. Ji obtained and provided Xu with more detailed background reports on the individuals. Ji also received training on how to speak to the FBI if approached at his school.\n\n\n\nIn May 2016, Ji joined the U.S. Army through a program that allowed legal aliens with vital skills like Chinese fluency. Ji told Xu and the MSS that he had successfully infiltrated the U.S. military as an MSS officer. His plan was to obtain citizenship quickly and obtain a top-secret security clearance.\n\n\n\nJi reported to an undercover FBI agent that he had access to all military bases with his military ID and volunteered, without prompting, to take pictures of aircraft carriers for the MSS.\n\n\n\nThe crimes committed by Ji were done on behalf of the MSS, through Xu Yanjun.\n\n\n\n\u201cXu\u2019s handling and placement of a spy within the United States to obtain information regarding aviation technology and employees is yet another facet of Xu\u2019s egregious crimes towards the United States and further justifies the significant sentence of imprisonment he received today,\u201d added U.S. Attorney Parker.\n\n\n\nThe MSS hacking of a French aerospace manufacturer\n\nThe evidence at trial showed Xu recruited insiders within a French aircraft engine manufacturer\u2019s facility in China who were willing to spy on Xu\u2019s behalf.\u00a0 Xu and his assets targeted a French employee of the company that often traveled to the facility in China for work. In 2013, Xu directed one of his assets within the company to plant malware on the French employee\u2019s work computer, with the ultimate goal of being able to infiltrate the company\u2019s network in France. The evidence at trial also showed Xu\u2019s integral role in the installation of the malware, his instructions to destroy the malware, and Xu\u2019s monitoring of the success and cover-up of the operation.\n\n\n\nKenneth L. Parker, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio; Matthew G. Olsen, Assistant Attorney General of the Department of Justice\u2019s National Security Division; and J. William Rivers, Special Agent in Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cincinnati Division; announced the sentence imposed today by U.S. District Judge Timothy S. Black.\n\n\n\nAssistant United States Attorney Timothy S. Mangan, Deputy Criminal Chief Emily N. Glatfelter, and Trial Attorney Matthew J. McKenzie from the Department of Justice\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section represented the United States in this case.\n\n\n\nU.S. Attorney Parker commended the integral cooperation of GE Aviation throughout the investigation and subsequent prosecution, as well as the DOJ Office of International Affairs and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices for the Northern District of Illinois and the District of Arizona.\n\n\n\n# # #",

Carrico announced today the arrest of a researcher at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK), following the return of a federal grand jury\u2019s indictment.\u00a0 Anming Hu, 51, an Associate Professor in the Department of Mechanical, Aerospace and Biomedical Engineering at UTK, is charged with three counts of wire fraud and three counts of making false statements.\n\nThe indictment alleges that beginning in 2016, Hu engaged in a scheme to defraud the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) by concealing his affiliation with Beijing University of Technology (BJUT) in China.\u00a0 Federal law prohibits NASA from using federally appropriated funds on projects in collaboration with China or Chinese universities.\u00a0 As alleged in the indictment, Hu\u2019s false representations and omissions to UTK about his affiliation with BJUT caused UTK to falsely certify to NASA that UTK was in compliance with federal law.\n\n\u201cThe United States Attorney\u2019s Office takes seriously fraudulent conduct that is devised to undermine federally-mandated funding restrictions related to China and Chinese universities,\u201d said U.S. Attorney J. Douglas Overbey for the Eastern District of Tennessee.\u00a0 \u201cThe University of Tennessee has cooperated with the investigation, and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office values the university\u2019s assistance in this matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cHu allegedly committed fraud by hiding his relationship with a Chinese university while receiving funding from NASA,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers.\u00a0 \u201cThis is just the latest case involving professors or researchers concealing their affiliations with China from their American employers and the U.S. government.\u00a0 We will not tolerate it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe FBI and its federal government, private-sector, and academic partners will continue to investigate and collaborate to counter these efforts at concealment, wherever they occur,\u201d said FBI Special-Agent-in-Charge Joseph E. Carrico.\n\nIf convicted, Hu faces up to 20 years in federal prison and a fine up to $250,000 on each of the wire fraud counts, and up to five years in prison on each of the false statement counts.\n\nThe maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendants will be determined by the assigned judge. \u00a0In all cases, defendants are presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty; indictments merely contain allegations supported by probable cause.\n\nThe case is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Offices of the Inspectors General for NASA and the Department of Energy, and the Department of Homeland Security-Homeland Security Investigations.\u00a0 The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Casey Arrowood and Frank Dale of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Tennessee, and Trial Attorney Nathan Charles of the Department of Justice\u2019s National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.\n\nThis case is part of the Department of Justice\u2019s China Initiative, which reflects the strategic priority of countering national security threats and reinforces the President\u2019s overall national security strategy.\u00a0 In addition to identifying and prosecuting those engaged in trade secret theft, hacking and economic espionage, the initiative will increase efforts to protect our critical infrastructure against external threats including direct foreign investment, supply chain threats and the foreign agents seeking to influence the American public and policymakers without proper registration.\n\n###",

            "article_text": "BOSTON \u2013 Dozens of individuals involved in a nationwide conspiracy that facilitated cheating on college entrance exams and the admission of students to elite universities as purported athletic recruits were arrested by federal agents in multiple states this morning and charged in federal court in Boston. Athletic coaches from Yale, Stanford, USC, Wake Forest and Georgetown, among others, are implicated, as well as parents and exam administrators.\n\nWilliam \u201cRick\u201d Singer, 58, of Newport Beach, Calif., was charged with racketeering conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy and obstruction of justice. Singer owned and operated the Edge College & Career Network LLC (\u201cThe Key\u201d) \u2013 a for-profit college counseling and preparation business \u2013 and served as the CEO of the Key Worldwide Foundation (KWF) \u2013 a non-profit corporation that he established as a purported charity.\n\nBetween approximately 2011 and February 2019, Singer allegedly conspired with dozens of parents, athletic coaches, a university athletics administrator, and others, to use bribery and other forms of fraud to secure the admission of students to colleges and universities including Yale University, Georgetown University, Stanford University, the University of Southern California, and Wake Forest University, among others. Also charged for their involvement in the scheme are 33 parents and 13 coaches and associates of Singer\u2019s businesses, including two SAT and ACT test administrators.\n\nAlso charged is John Vandemoer, the head sailing coach at Stanford University, Rudolph \u201cRudy\u201d Meredith, the former head soccer coach at Yale University, and Mark Riddell, a counselor at a private school in Bradenton, Fla.\n\nThe conspiracy involved 1) bribing SAT and ACT exam administrators to allow a test taker, typically Riddell, to secretly take college entrance exams in place of students or to correct the students\u2019 answers after they had taken the exam; 2) bribing university athletic coaches and administrators\u2014including coaches at Yale, Stanford, Georgetown, the University of Southern California, and the University of Texas\u2014to facilitate the admission of students to elite universities under the guise of being recruited as athletes; and (3) using the fa\u00e7ade of Singer\u2019s charitable organization to conceal the nature and source of the bribes.\n\nAccording to the charging documents, Singer facilitated cheating on the SAT and ACT exams for his clients by instructing them to seek extended time for their children on college entrance exams, which included having the children purport to have learning disabilities in order to obtain the required medical documentation. Once the extended time was granted, Singer allegedly instructed the clients to change the location of the exams to one of two test centers: a public high school in Houston, Texas, or a private college preparatory school in West Hollywood, Calif. At those test centers, Singer had established relationships with test administrators Niki Williams and Igor Dvorskiy, respectively, who accepted bribes of as much as $10,000 per test in order to facilitate the cheating scheme. Specifically, Williams and Dvorskiy allowed a third individual, typically Riddell, to take the exams in place of the students, to give the students the correct answers during the exams, or to correct the students\u2019 answers after they completed the exams. Singer typically paid Ridell $10,000 for each student\u2019s test. Singer\u2019s clients paid him between $15,000 and $75,000 per test, with the payments structured as purported donations to the KWF charity. In many instances, the students taking the exams were unaware that their parents had arranged for the cheating.\n\nIt is further alleged that throughout the conspiracy, parents paid Singer approximately $25 million to bribe coaches and university administrators to designate their children as purported athletic recruits, thereby facilitating the children\u2019s\u2019 admission to those universities. Singer allegedly described the scheme to his customers as a \u201cside door,\u201d in which the parents paid Singer under the guise of charitable donations to KWF. In turn, Singer funneled those payments to programs controlled by the athletic coaches, who then designated the children as recruited athletes \u2013 regardless of their athletic experience and abilities. Singer also made bribe payments to most of the coaches personally.\n\nFor example, during a call with one parent, Singer stated: \u201cOkay, so, who we are\u2026what we do is we help the wealthiest families in the U.S. get their kids into school\u2026My families want a guarantee. So, if you said to me \u2018here\u2019s our grades, here\u2019s our scores, here\u2019s our ability, and we want to go to X school\u2019 and you give me one or two schools, and then I\u2019ll go after those schools and try to get a guarantee done.\u201d\n\nAs part of the scheme, Singer directed employees of The Key and the KWF to create falsified athletic \u201cprofiles\u201d for students, which were then submitted to the universities in support of the students\u2019 applications. The profiles included fake honors that the students purportedly received and elite teams that they purportedly played on. \u00a0In some instances, parents supplied Singer with staged photos of their children engaged in athletic activity \u2013 such as using a rowing machine or purportedly playing water polo.\n\nBeginning around 2013, Singer allegedly agreed with certain clients to disguise bribe payments as charitable contributions to the KWF, thereby enabling clients to deduct the bribes from their federal income taxes. Specifically, Singer allegedly instructed clients to make payments to the KWF in return for facilitating their children\u2019s admission to a chosen university. Singer used a portion of that money to bribe university athletic coaches to designate the children as student athletes. Thereafter, Masera or another KWF employee mailed letters from the KWF to the clients expressing thanks for their purported charitable contributions. The letter stated: \u201cYour generosity will allow us to move forward with our plans to provide educational and self-enrichment programs to disadvantaged youth,\u201d and falsely indicated that \u201cno good or services were exchanged\u201d for the donations. Many clients then filed personal tax returns that falsely reported the payment to the KWF as charitable donations.\n\nThe charge of racketeering conspiracy provides for a sentence of no greater than 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release, a fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss, whichever is greater and restitution. The charge of conspiracy to commit money laundering provides for a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, up to three years of supervised release, and a fine of not more than $500,000 or twice the value of the property involved in the money laundering. The charge of conspiracy to defraud the United States provides for a sentence of no greater than five years in prison, up to three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000. The charge of obstruction of justice provides for a sentence of no greater than 10 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000. The charges of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud, and of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and honest services wire fraud, provide for a sentence of no greater than 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a fine of 250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss, whichever is greater. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nUnited States Attorney Andrew E. Lelling; Joseph R. Bonavolonta, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Boston Field Division; and Kristina O\u2019Connell, Special Agent in Charge of the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s Criminal Investigations in Boston, made the announcement today. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Eric S. Rosen, Justin D. O\u2019Connell, Leslie Wright, and Kristen A. Kearney of Lelling\u2019s Securities and Financial Fraud Unit are prosecuting the case.\n\nThe details contained in the charging documents are allegations. The defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.\n\nAppendix\n\nThe following defendants were charged in an indictment with racketeering conspiracy:\n\nThe following defendant was charged in a criminal complaint with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud:\n\nThe following defendants were charged in a criminal complaint with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud:\n\n",

            "article_text": "CLARKSBURG \u2013 Dr. Qingyun Sun, of Morgantown, West Virginia, was sentenced today to three years of probation, with the first four months on home confinement, after defrauding West Virginia University and filing a false tax return, both offenses arising out of his official travel to China, U.S. Attorney Bill Powell announced.\n\nSun, age 58, pleaded guilty to a two-count information charging him with wire fraud and filing a false tax return in July 2020. Sun was a Chinese National employed by WVU as an associate professor and the associate director of the United States-China Energy Center at the University. As a part of his employment at WVU, through the West Virginia Development Office, he also acted as the Governor\u2019s assistant for China affairs. He was also employed by Synfuels Americas Corporation, an energy conversion technology provider of coal-to-liquids and gas-to-liquids processes located in Sterling, Virginia, but headquartered in Beijing, China. From July 2011 to May 2015, Peabody Energy Generation Holding Company based in St. Louis, Missouri, paid consulting fees to Energy United LC, a consulting business Sun established in 2005. The scheme involved Sun\u2019s operation of his consulting business through Energy United.\n\nIn 2015, Sun traveled to China on behalf of WVU and the WV Development Office to prepare for an upcoming visit to China by WVU representatives and to lead a West Virginia industrial delegation for a coal expo in Beijing. Sun booked both a coach flight and a business class flight for this trip, submitting a request for reimbursement to WVU for the coach flight, and submitting a request for reimbursement to Synfuels Americas for the business flight. Sun only used the business class ticket for his trip.\n\nIn 2014, Sun filed a joint income tax return with his wife, grossly overstating his business-related travel expenses, when a large sum of those travel expenses were paid for by a State Purchasing Card, or reimbursed to him by WVU and Peabody Energy. He also failed to state any financial interest in, or authority over, a financial account in a foreign country. Sun had an interest in numerous financial accounts in China.\n\nAs a part of the plea agreement, Sun has agreed to pay restitution in the amount of $6,233.12 in full to WVU. \u00a0Sun is no longer employed by WVU.\n\nSun was also ordered to pay for the four months of home confinement monitoring as a part of his sentencing.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Jarod J. Douglas prosecuted the case on behalf of the government. The FBI and the Internal Revenue Service investigated. WVU cooperated in the investigation of this case.\n\nSenior U.S. District Judge Irene M. Keeley presided.",

            "article_text": "LOS ANGELES\u2013 Three Los Angeles-area residents responsible for operating a network of four schools were arrested this morning on federal charges for allegedly helping hundreds of foreign nationals remain in the United States as foreign students, even though they never attended classes.\n\nThe three defendants allegedly ran a \u201cpay-to-stay\u201d scheme through three schools in Koreatown \u2013 Prodee University/Neo-America Language School; Walter Jay M.D. Institute, an Educational Center (WJMD); and the American College of Forensic Studies (ACFS) \u2013 and a fourth school currently operating in Alhambra, Likie Fashion and Technology College.\n\nThe three defendants are named in a 21-count indictment returned yesterday by a federal grand jury. The indictment alleges a conspiracy to commit immigration fraud, a host of immigration offenses and money laundering.\n\nThe indictment also contains an allegation that would require the defendants to forfeit property and proceeds derived from the fraud scheme, which investigators estimate took in as much as $6 million a year in \u201ctuition\u201d payments.\n\n\u201cImmigration fraud schemes potentially compromise national security and cheat foreign nationals who play by the rules,\u201d said Acting United States Attorney Stephanie Yonekura. \u201cIn this case, officials at several schools allegedly abused their responsibility to ensure that only legitimate foreign students were allowed to the stay in the country. This type of fraud against the United States will be thoroughly examined to bring those responsible to justice and to protect the integrity of our immigration system.\u201d\n\nThose named in the indictment unsealed today are:\n\nHee Sun Shim (also known as Leonard Shim and Leo Shim), 51, of Beverly Hills, the owner and manager of the schools;\n\nHyung Chan Moon (also known as Steve Moon), 39, of Los Angeles, who assisted with the operation and management of the schools; and\n\nEun Young Choi (also known as Jamie Choi), 35, of Los Angeles, a former employee who assisted with the operation and management of the schools.\n\nThe defendants, who were taken into custody by special agents with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI),are expected to be arraigned on the indictment tomorrow in United States District Court.\n\n\u201cGiven the implications for national security and public safety, we will move aggressively to target individuals who compromise the integrity of our nation\u2019s immigration system out of greed and self-interest,\u201d said Claude Arnold, special agent in charge for HSI Los Angeles. \u201cSimply put, those who exploit the benefits of the student visa program can expect to get a lesson in criminal justice.\u201d\n\nThe investigation in this case began in 2011 after a compliance team from HSI\u2019s Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) paid an unannounced visit to Prodee University\u2019s main campus on Wilshire Boulevard. During the visit, the team observed only one English language class with three students in attendance, even though records for the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) showed more than 900 foreign students were enrolled at Prodee\u2019s two campuses. That same day, the SEVP team made an unannounced visit to ACFS where they found only one religion class in session with a single student present. At the time, SEVIS records indicated that ACFS had more than 300 foreign students in active status.\n\nDuring the ensuing investigation, HSI special agents identified several dozen foreign nationals, primarily from South Korea and China, who originally entered the U.S. as F-1 non-immigrant students to attend other SEVP authorized schools, but subsequently transferred to schools in the Prodee network. These students lived across the nation, indicating that they were not actually attending classes at Prodee or the other schools.\n\nAs detailed in the indictment, Prodee and its affiliated schools were authorized to issue a document that certified a foreign national had been accepted to a school and would be a full-time student. The document \u2013 \u201cCertificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant (F-1) Student Status - for Academic and Language Students,\u201d which is commonly called a Form I-20 \u2013 made a student eligible to obtain an F-1 student visa that would allow the student to enter and remain in the United States while the student was making normal progress toward completing a full course of study.\n\nThe indictment alleges that Prodee and the other schools issued Form I-20s to foreign nationals who were not bona fide students, had no intention of attending the schools and lived outside of California. As part of the conspiracy, Shim and Choi allegedly were involved in the creation of bogus student records, including transcripts, for some of the students for the purpose of deceiving immigration authorities. The indictment further alleges that Shim would transfer a purported student from one school to another to avoid arousing the suspicion of immigration authorities about \u201cstudents\u201d who had been in the United States for lengthy periods of time.\n\nIn exchange for the Form I-20, a student would make \u201ctuition\u201d payments of as much as $1,800 to \u201cenroll\u201d for six months in one of the schools, according to the indictment.\n\nThe indictment charges Shim, Moon and Choi with conspiring to commit immigration fraud. Shim is charged with 13 counts of use or possession of an immigration document procured by fraud; and Moon and Choi are each charged with one count of the same offense. Shim is charged with three counts of encouraging illegal residence, as well as two counts of money laundering.\n\nThe conspiracy count carries a statutory maximum sentence of five years in federal prison. The substantive immigration fraud charges each carry up to 10 years in prison. The money laundering charges carry a potential penalty of 20 years.\n\nAn indictment contains allegations that a defendant has committed a crime. Every defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty in court.\n\nEffective immediately, Prodee and its affiliated schools will no longer be able to access SEVIS, and HSI will be seeking to withdraw the schools\u2019 SEVP certification, which will bar the institutions from enrolling foreign students. Foreign students who are currently enrolled at any of these schools should contact SEVP representatives for further instructions at (703) 603-3400 weekdays between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. EDT. Additional information for affected students has also been posted on the SEVP Web page on ICE\u2019s website, http://www.ice.gov/sevis/whats-new.\n\nSEVP monitors approximately 1 million international students who are pursuing studies in the U.S. on F and M visas. It also certifies schools that enroll these students and manages the SEVIS database, which houses information on international students, exchange visitors and their dependents. In addition to unannounced site visits to SEVP-certified schools, SEVP\u2019s compliance unit has implemented a number of measures to ensure only bona fide U.S. schools can enroll international students, including the use of a risk assessment tool, requirements for regular recertification, and the deployment of field representatives to visit certified schools twice yearly.\n\nThe HSI-led investigation into Prodee is ongoing. HSI has received substantial assistance with the case from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\u2019 Fraud Detection and National Security Division.\n\nRelease No. 15-026",

            "article_text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Kexue Huang, a Chinese national and a former resident of Carmel, Ind., pleaded guilty today to one count of economic espionage to benefit a component of the Chinese government and one count of theft of trade secrets.\n\n\n\nThe guilty plea was announced by Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division, Assistant Attorney General for National Security Lisa O. Monaco, U.S. Attorney Joseph H. Hogsett of the Southern District of Indiana, U.S. Attorney B. Todd Jones of the District of Minnesota, and Robert J. Holley, Special Agent in Charge of the Indianapolis Field Office of the FBI.\n\n\n\nThis is the first trade secret prosecution in Indiana under a provision of the Economic Espionage Act that prohibits trade secret theft intended to benefit a component of a foreign government.\u00a0 Since its enactment in 1996, there have been a total of eight such cases charged nationwide under the Economic Espionage Act.\n\n\n\nHuang, 46, pleaded guilty to the charges before U.S. District Judge William T. Lawrence in the Southern District of Indiana.\u00a0 In July 2010, Huang was charged in an indictment filed in the Southern District of Indiana for misappropriating and transporting trade secrets to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) while working as a research scientist at Dow AgroSciences LLC.\u00a0 Today, a separate indictment filed in the District of Minnesota was unsealed, charging Huang with stealing a trade secret from a second company, Cargill Inc.\n\n\n\nAccording to court documents, from January 2003 until February 2008, Huang was employed as a research scientist at Dow, a leading international agricultural company based in Indianapolis that provides agrochemical and biotechnology products.\u00a0 In 2005, Huang became a research leader for Dow in strain development related to unique, proprietary organic insecticides marketed worldwide.\n\n\n\nAs a Dow employee, Huang signed an agreement that outlined his obligations in handling confidential information, including trade secrets, and prohibited him from disclosing any confidential information without Dow\u2019s consent. Dow employed several layers of security to preserve and maintain confidentiality and to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of its trade secrets.\n\n\n\nHuang admitted that during his employment at Dow, he misappropriated several Dow trade secrets.\u00a0 According to plea documents, from 2007 to 2010, Huang transferred and delivered the stolen Dow trade secrets to individuals in Germany and the PRC.\u00a0 With the assistance of these individuals, Huang used the stolen materials to conduct unauthorized research with the intent to benefit foreign universities that were instrumentalities of the PRC government.\u00a0 Huang also admitted that he pursued steps to develop and produce the misappropriated Dow trade secrets in the PRC, including identifying manufacturing facilities in the PRC that would allow him to compete directly with Dow in the established organic pesticide market.\n\n\n\nAccording to court documents, after Huang left Dow, he was hired in March 2008 by Cargill, an international producer and marketer of food, agricultural, financial and industrial products and services.\u00a0 Huang worked as a biotechnologist for Cargill until July 2009 and signed a confidentiality agreement promising never to disclose any trade secrets or other confidential information of Cargill.\u00a0 Huang admitted that during his employment with Cargill, he stole one of the company\u2019s trade secrets \u2013 a key component in the manufacture of a new food product, which he later disseminated to another person, specifically a student at Hunan Normal University in the PRC.\n\n\n\nAccording to the plea agreement, the aggregated loss from Huang\u2019s criminal conduct exceeds $7 million but is less than $20 million.\n\n\n\n\u201cMr. Huang used his insider status at two of America\u2019s largest agricultural companies to steal valuable trade secrets for use in his native China,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Breuer.\u00a0 \u201cWe cannot allow U.S. citizens or foreign nationals to hand sensitive business information over to competitors in other countries, and we will continue our vigorous criminal enforcement of economic espionage and trade secret laws.\u00a0 These crimes present a danger to the U.S. economy and jeopardize our nation\u2019s leadership in innovation.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s plea underscores the continuing threat posed by the theft of business secrets for the benefit of China and other nations,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Monaco.\n\n\n\nU.S. Attorney Hogsett noted that it is the first time economic espionage has been charged in the Southern District of Indiana.\u00a0 Hogsett remarked that \u201cas U.S. Attorney, I am committed to working with Hoosier businesses who have been victimized and doing everything within our influence to protect Hoosier companies.\u201d\u00a0 Hogsett praised Dow for its cooperation with the investigation and prosecution, noting that \u201ccompanies must first report and then work with federal investigators and prosecutors if we are to stem the illicit export of trade secrets vital to the economy not only of Indiana but the United States.\u201d\u00a0 Hogsett also stated, \u201cthe dual prosecutions from Indiana and Minnesota should serve as a warning to anyone who is considering robbing American companies of their information and weaken the American economy by selling that information to foreign governments or others that he will face severe consequences.\u00a0 The federal agents and prosecutors who worked tirelessly in these two cases are to be commended for their hard work and dedication.\u201d\n\n\n\nFBI Special Agent in Charge Holley stated:\u00a0 \u201cAmong the various economic espionage and theft of trade secret cases that the FBI has investigated in Indiana, the vast majority involve an inside employee with legitimate access who is stealing in order to benefit another organization or country.\u00a0 This type of threat, which the FBI refers to as the Insider Threat, often causes the most damage.\u00a0 In order to maintain our competitive advantage in these sectors, industry must identify their most important equities, realize that they are a target, implement internal protection mechanisms to protect their intellectual property, and communicate issues of concern immediately to the FBI.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt sentencing, Huang faces a maximum prison sentence of 15 years on the economic espionage charge and 10 years on the theft of trade secrets charge.\n\n\n\nThe case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Cynthia J. Ridgeway of the Southern District of Indiana, Trial Attorneys Mark L. Krotoski and Evan C. Williams of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Paulsen of the District of Minnesota, with assistance from the National Security Division\u2019s Counterespionage Section.",

MEYYAPPAN pled guilty on January 13, 2021, before U.S. District Judge P. Kevin Castel, who also imposed today\u2019s sentence.\n\nU.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said:\u00a0 \u201cAs a senior NASA scientist with access to sensitive and confidential U.S. government technologies and intellectual property, Meyya Meyyappan was understandably subject to restrictions regarding outside employment and compensation.\u00a0 When questioned by the FBI and NASA, Meyyappan gave false statements regarding his employment by a Chinese government-funded program that recruited individuals with access to foreign technologies and intellectual property. The privilege of access to cutting edge U.S. technologies and intellectual property comes with the critical responsibility of protecting their secrecy. Meyyappan betrayed that trust, by failing to disclose his foreign activities and then compounding his mistakes by lying to the FBI and NASA.\u00a0 He has now been sentenced to time in federal prison for his unlawful conduct.\u201d\n\nAccording to the allegations in the Information and other proceedings in this case:\n\nFrom in or about 1996 through in or about 2021, MEYYAPPAN was employed by NASA, an independent U.S. government agency responsible for the civilian space program, as well as aeronautics and aerospace research.\u00a0 Beginning in or about 2006, MEYYAPPAN was the Chief Scientist, Exploration Technology at the Center for Nanotechnology, at NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center at Moffett Field in Silicon Valley, California.\n\nIn his position at NASA, MEYYAPPAN was subject to certain statutory, regulatory, and agency restrictions and reporting requirements regarding, among other things, outside employment, travel, and compensation.\u00a0 Notwithstanding these prohibitions, MEYYAPPAN participated in China\u2019s Thousand Talents Program, a program established by the Chinese government to recruit individuals with access to or knowledge of foreign technology or intellectual property, and held professorships at universities in China, South Korea, and Japan, and failed to disclose these associations and positions to NASA and the U.S. Office of Government Ethics.\n\nOn or about October 27, 2020, MEYYAPPAN was interviewed by the FBI, NASA OIG, and the USAO, in New York, New York.\u00a0 During that proffer session, MEYYAPPAN falsely stated, among other things, that he was not a member of the Thousand Talents Program and that he did not hold a professorship at a Chinese university.\u00a0 In truth and in fact, MEYYAPPAN was a member of the Thousand Talents Program and held a professorship at a Chinese university, funded by the Chinese government.\n\n* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\n\nMEYYAPPAN, 66, of Pacifica, California was also ordered to pay a fine of $ 100,000.\n\nMs. Strauss praised the outstanding work of the FBI and NASA OIG.\n\nThis case is being handled by the Office\u2019s Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force.\u00a0 Assistant United States Attorney Joshua A.

            "article_text": "A dual U.S.-Israeli citizen who serves as the co-director of a Maryland-based think tank was indicted today for allegedly engaging in multiple international criminal schemes.\n\nAccording to court documents, Gal Luft, 57, is charged in an eight-count indictment with offenses related to willfully failing to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), arms trafficking, Iranian sanctions violations and making false statements to federal agents. Luft was arrested on Feb. 17 in the Republic of Cyprus based on the charges in the indictment. Luft subsequently fled after being released on bail while extradition proceedings were pending and remains a fugitive.\n\nAccording to the allegations contained in the indictment, for years, Luft conspired with others in an effort to act within the United States to advance the interests of the People\u2019s Republic of China (China) as agents of China-based principals, without registering as foreign agents as required under U.S. law. As part of this scheme, while serving as the co-director of a Maryland-based nonprofit think tank, Luft agreed to covertly recruit and pay, on behalf of principals based in China, a former high-ranking U.S. government official (Individual-1), including in 2016 while the former official was an adviser to the then-President-elect, to publicly support certain policies with respect to China without Luft or Individual-1 filing a registration statement as an agent of a foreign principal with the Attorney General of the United States, in violation of FARA.\n\nAmong other things, in the weeks before the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Luft and a co-conspirator (CC-1), who is a Chinese national and worked for a Chinese nongovernmental organization affiliated with a Chinese energy company, created a written \u201cdialogue\u201d between CC-1 and Individual-1, in which Luft wrote Individual-1\u2019s responses and included information that was favorable to China. The dialogue was then published in a Chinese newspaper online and sent to, among others, individuals in the United States, including a journalist and professors at multiple U.S. universities. When Luft was writing the dialogue, CC-1 told Luft that \u201c[i]n these articles, we do not want to spill all the beans yet, just enough to let \u2018people\u2019 know he [i.e., Individual-1] is in the corridor of power to be. Just broad stroke policy consideration that leaves plenty of room for interpretation and imagination to be filled in later.\u201d After the purported \u201cconversations\u201d were published, Luft told CC-1 that certain information, favorable to China, had been \u201ctucked between the lines.\u201d Shortly after the 2016 election, Luft and CC-1 also discussed possible roles Individual-1 might have in the incoming U.S. administration, and discussed Individual-1 taking a \u201csilent trip\u201d to China. Luft responded that \u201c[w]e are debating about his role in the new admin. There are all kinds of considerations . . .We should talk ftf [i.e., face-to-face] as there can be a supremely unique opportunity for china.\u201d\n\nSecond, Luft conspired with others and attempted to broker illicit arms transactions with, among others, certain Chinese individuals and entities. In his role as a broker or middleman, Luft worked to find both buyers and sellers of certain weapons and other materials, without a license to do so as required under U.S. law, in violation of the Arms Export Control Act. Among other things, Luft worked to broker a deal for Chinese companies to sell certain weapons to Libya, including anti-tank launchers, grenade launchers and mortar rounds (which Luft and his associates referred to in coded language as \u201ctoys\u201d). Luft also worked to broker deals for certain weapons to be sold to the United Arab Emirates, including arial bombs and rockets. Luft further worked to broker deals for certain weapons to be sold by a Chinese company to Kenya, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) \u2013 and specifically \u201cstrike\u201d UAVs, which Luft acknowledged \u201c[t]he US doesn\u2019t want to sell[, . . .] hence the opportunity.\u201d Luft also discussed brokering a deal for weapons to Qatar, and told CC-1 that Israel was \u201cnot a good fit\u201d as the middleman for the deal because it had the \u201c[s]ame problem the [] Q [i.e., Qataris] have w uncle [i.e., the United States]. Need a third party. . . . I will activate.\u201d In his role as a broker for illicit arms deals, Luft worked on a commission basis, and traveled to meetings and received and passed on documentation needed to secure the deals. During a voluntary interview with U.S. law enforcement in which he was asked questions about his involvement in arms trafficking, Luft made multiple false statements, including that he had just been checking prices for a friend and had not sought to engage in or profit from arms deals.\n\nThird, Luft conspired with others and attempted to broker deals for Iranian oil \u2013 which he directed an associate to refer to as \u201cBrazilian\u201d oil in an effort to conceal the activity and evade sanctions \u2013 in violation of U.S. sanctions against Iran and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). In his role as a broker or middleman, Luft solicited buyers and passed on pricing and other information.

            "article_text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio \u2013 A rheumatology professor and researcher with strong ties to China has been ordered held without bond to face a charge of grant fraud for not disclosing that he was engaged in a sophisticated scheme to use approximately $4.1 million in grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to develop China\u2019s expertise in the areas of rheumatology and immunology.\u00a0 He is also charged with making false statements about maintaining employment in China at the same time he was employed at universities in the United States, including The Ohio State University.\n\nSong Guo Zheng, 57, was arrested Friday, May 22, 2020, after he arrived in Anchorage, Alaska, aboard a charter flight and as he prepared to board another charter flight to China.\u00a0 When he was arrested, he was carrying three large bags, one small suitcase and a briefcase containing two laptops, three cellular telephones, several USB drives, several silver bars, expired Chinese passports for his family, deeds for property in China and other items.\n\n\u201cYet again, we are faced with a professor at a U.S. University, who is a member of a Chinese Talent Plan, allegedly and deliberately failing to disclose his relationship with a Chinese university and receipt of funds from the Chinese Government in order to obtain millions of dollars in U.S. grant money designed to benefit the health and well-being of the people of the United States \u2014 not to be hijacked to supplement the research goals of the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers.\u00a0 \u201cThis case, like too many others, should serve as a reminder that the United States Government takes seriously the obligation of truthfulness and transparency on grant applications, and those who violate the law to benefit China or any other foreign nation will be held accountable.\u201d\n\n\"This case highlights\u00a0another example of a Chinese Talent Plan member allegedly using U.S. taxpayer funds for the benefit of the Chinese government,\" said Alan E. Kohler, Jr, Assistant Director of the FBI's Counterintelligence Division. \"According to the criminal complaint, Zheng violated laws concerning the use of federal research funds and did not disclose his employment in China. The FBI will continue to work with our partners to stop such illegal activity and protect U.S. research.\"\n\n\u201cWe allege that Zheng was preparing to flee the country after he learned that his employer had begun an administrative process into whether or not he was complying with rules governing taxpayer-funded grants,\u201d said David M. DeVillers, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio.\u00a0 \u201cThis is our office\u2019s third recent case involving the illegal transfer of intellectual property and research to China. This underscores our commitment to work with the FBI, the Department of Health and Human Services, and our research institutions to protect our country\u2019s position as a global leader in research and innovation, and to punish those who try to exploit and undermine that position.\u201d\n\n\"The taxpayers of the United States are the real victims when researchers defraud our government and exploit our system to benefit China,\u201d stated FBI Cincinnati Special Agent in Charge Chris Hoffman.\u00a0 \u201cThe cutting-edge technologies that are being developed in our country must be carefully protected from our foreign adversaries and the FBI will continue to work with our partners to safeguard these important innovations.\u201d\n\nA criminal complaint filed May 23 and unsealed following today\u2019s detention hearing charges Zheng with one count of fraud or bribery concerning programs receiving federal funds, a crime punishable by up to ten years in prison, and one count of making false statements, which is punishable by up to five years in prison.\u00a0 Magistrate Judge Elizabeth Preston Deavers ordered Zheng held without bond because he is a flight risk.\u00a0 The case will be presented to a federal grand jury for possible indictment.\u00a0 The investigation is continuing.\n\nAn affidavit filed with the complaint alleges that, since 2013, Zheng has been participating in a Chinese Talent Plan, a program established by the Chinese government to recruit individuals with knowledge or access to foreign technology intellectual property.\u00a0 Since then, Zheng has used research conducted in the U.S. to benefit the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u00a0 Zheng allegedly failed to disclose conflicts of interest or his foreign commitments to his U.S. employers or to the NIH.\n\nAssistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers, U.S. Attorney DeVillers, and Christopher Hoffman, Special Agent in Charge, FBI, Cincinnati Field Division announced the criminal complaint, and acknowledged the assistance of the Anchorage FBI Division who arrested Zheng, interviewed him and executed multiple warrants while he was detained, and the assistance provided by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Alaska.\u00a0 Assistant U.S. Attorneys Douglas W.

            "article_text": "ALBUQUERQUE \u2013 Jianyu Huang, a scientist formerly employed by  Sandia Corporation (Sandia) at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), was  sentenced to a term of imprisonment of a year and a day for the crimes of making  a false statement within the jurisdiction of the Department of Energy (DOE), and  unlawfully transporting stolen government property in interstate and foreign commerce.\u00a0 The sentence was announced by U.S. Attorney  Damon P. Martinez and Special Agent in Charge Carol K.O. Lee of the FBI\u2019s  Albuquerque Division.\n\nHuang, 46, a naturalized U.S. citizen from the People\u2019s  Republic of China who resides in Albuquerque, N.M., was arrested in June 2012,  on a six-count indictment charging him with misusing U.S. government resources  and equipment to conduct research for Chinese research institutions and with falsely  stating that he did not intend to take U.S. government equipment with him on a  trip to China.\u00a0 The indictment  subsequently was superseded to add an interstate transportation of converted  property charge and a theft of government property charge.\u00a0 Huang was employed by Sandia until his  employment was terminated in late April 2012.\u00a0  On August 25, 2014, Huang pleaded guilty to the false statement and  transportation of stolen property charges.\n\nSNL is a government-owned research facility operated by  Sandia Corporation for DOE National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) that  is responsible for ensuring the safety of the nation\u2019s nuclear stockpile;  enhancing the security of energy and other critical resources; reducing the  proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; addressing threats to national  security; and protecting the nation against terrorism.\u00a0 The Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies (CINT)  is a DOE user facility and science research center devoted to establishing  scientific principles that govern the design, performance, and integration of  materials on the atomic and molecular scale, located at SNL.\u00a0 CINT is comprised of a core facility at  Sandia and a Gateway Facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory.\n\nIn light of the sensitivity of SNL\u2019s work, all Sandia employees  are required to report to the Sandia Office of Counterintelligence (SOC) any  substantive relationship with foreign nationals, including associations that  involve meeting and sharing work-related information.\u00a0 Sandia employees also are required to submit  to interviews with SOC before international travel on official business, and  are prohibited from bringing government-owned equipment on international travel  without prior approval.\n\nHuang was employed by Sandia at CINT, where he worked in an  unclassified open science facility without access to classified national  security information.\u00a0 As a Sandia  employee, Huang was prohibited from bringing government-owned equipment on  international travel without prior approval.\n\nCounts 1 through 5 of the second superseding indictment  charged Huang with federal program fraud and alleged that between Jan. 2009 and  Jan. 2012, Huang unlawfully and without authority used DOE equipment, materials  and property to conduct research for businesses and universities in the People\u2019s  Republic of China.\u00a0 Count 6 charged Huang  with making a false statement charge to a federal officer and alleged that, in  June 2011, Huang falsely represented to a counterintelligence officer that he would  not take any U.S. government electronic equipment with him on an upcoming trip  to the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u00a0 The  statement was false because Huang knew that he intended to take a U.S.  government computer and hard-drive to the People\u2019s Republic of China on that  trip, and did in fact take that equipment with him.\u00a0 Count 7 charged Huang with the interstate  transportation of converted property charge and alleged that between June 30,  2011 and July 18, 2011, Huang unlawfully transported a DOE-owned laptop  computer and computer-related media in interstate and foreign commerce.\u00a0 Count 8 charged Huang with an embezzlement  charge and alleged that between April 25, 2012 and June 2, 2012, Huang  embezzled electronic files and documents, including research proposals,  belonging to DOE that came into his possession by virtue of his employment with  SNL.\n\nIn his plea agreement, Huang admitted taking a trip to China  in July 2011, for the purpose of attending and making a presentation at a  research conference.\u00a0 Huang acknowledged  that in seeking and obtaining Sandia\u2019s permission to participate in the  conference, he represented that he would not take any DOE-owned equipment with  him.\u00a0 Huang also admitted deliberately lying  to a counterintelligence office when he made the representation because he intended  to take his DOE-owned laptop on the trip.\n\nHuang admitted taking a DOE-owned laptop computer with him  when he traveled to China on June 30 and July 1, 2011, even though he knew that  he did not have permission to do so.\u00a0 In  so doing, Huang unlawfully converted the laptop computer to his own use.\u00a0 According to Huang\u2019s plea agreement, U.S.  Customs and Border Protection agents seized the DOE-owned laptop from Huang\u2019s  baggage when he returned to the United States on July 18, 2011, after Huang  admitted that he did not have permission to take the laptop computer out of the  country.\n\nAt this afternoon\u2019s hearing, the court accepted the terms of  the plea agreement and sentenced Huang to a year and a day in federal prison  followed by a year of supervised release.The case was investigated by the Albuquerque Division of the  FBI and prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathon M.

            "article_text": "CHARLOTTESVILLE, VIRGINIA \u2013 A New Jersey man, and the fourth member of a Charlottesville-based fake identification ring, pled guilty this morning in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia in Charlottesville.\n\nMichael A. DelRio, a.k.a. \u201cCopernicus Lionheart\u201d age 19, of Edison, New Jersey, pled guilty today in U.S. District Court to one count of conspiracy to commit identification document fraud. Previously, Alan McNeil Jones, Kelly Erin McPhee and Mark Gil Bernardo all pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit identification fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft for their roles in the conspiracy.\n\n\u201cMr. DelRio played a significant role in perpetuating a high-tech and sophisticated scheme to produce and sell high-quality false identification documents all across the nation,\u201d United States Attorney Timothy J. Heaphy said today. \u201cHe worked to develop a web-based interface for potential customers that, if deployed, would have made the criminal enterprise even more lucrative than it was. Because false identification documents present very real threat to our security, we will continue to prioritize cases like that against Mr. DelRio and his co-conspirators.\u201d\n\n\"Counterfeit identity documents, like the ones produced by this ring, can be used by criminals, enabling them to mask their identities and operate with ease in the United States,\" said Scot Rittenberg, acting special agent in charge of ICE Homeland Security Investigations, Washington. \"HSI is committed to stopping this threat that undermines our nation's security.\"\n\nPreviously, Jones, McPhee and Bernardo admitted to conspiring to create high-quality, fraudulent driver\u2019s licenses out of the home they shared on Rugby Road in Charlottesville. The conspiracy, which began in 2010 and operated under the name Novel Design, produced and sold more than 25,000 fraudulent driver\u2019s licenses, primarily to college students, throughout the nation.\n\nAs part of the scheme, Jones paid commissions to students at the University of Virginia, and elsewhere, to refer his service to other students interested in obtaining fraudulent driver\u2019s licenses. He also outsourced some of the manufacturing work to companies in Bangladesh and China.\n\nJones and Bernardo recruited DelRio to streamline the website for their fraudulent identification business. Jones paid DelRio $15,000 to build a website that would allow customers to input biographical information directly onto the site, which would then be printed on the fraudulent identification document each customer had ordered. Allowing customers to enter information via a secure, off-shore website would have saved the conspirators the time it previously took to input that information by hand. Both Jones and Bernardo indicated that DelRio had been informed of the nature and use of the program he was being asked to produce.\n\nAt sentencing, DelRio faces a maximum possible penalty of up to 15 years in prison and/or a fine of up to $250,000.\n\nThe investigation of the case was conducted by U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement\u2019s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HIS) Washington, the United States Postal Inspection Service, the Virginia State Police and the Virginia Attorney General\u2019s Computer Forensics Unit. United States Attorney Timothy J. Heaphy, Assistant United States Attorney Ronald Huber and third-year University of Virginia Law Student Maggie Sullivan prosecuted the case for the United States.",

Zwart. Xia\u2019s sentencing hearing was scheduled for July 23, 2021 at 1:30 pm in front of Chief United States District Court Judge John M. Gerrard. Coercion and Enticement of a Minor is punishable by a mandatory minimum of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment up to life imprisonment, a $250,000 fine, both imprisonment and a fine, a special assessment of $5,000, and a term of supervised release of no less than 5 years up to a lifetime term of supervised release.\n\nBetween June 1, 2018 to February 28, 2020, Xia was a graduate student at the University of Nebraska Omaha. Xia is a Chinese national. Xia met Victim 1\u2019s mother and Victim 1\u2019s mother hired Xia to tutor Victim 1 in the Chinese language. Xia began tutoring Victim 1 in June of 2018. Xia met Victim 1 in person for the tutoring sessions and began communicating with Victim 1 over the social media application WeChat. Xia began inquiring over WeChat about Victim 1\u2019s sexual history.\n\nOn July 10, 2018, Victim 1 attended a summer camp at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln. Xia messaged Victim 1 over the Internet using WeChat about his plan to visit her in Lincoln on July 11. During this conversation, Xia discussed various forms of birth control with Victim 1 in response to Victim 1 relaying her fears of becoming pregnant while in high school. Xia reserved a room at the Red Roof Inn and Suites in Lincoln for the night of July 11. Xia picked up Victim 1 from the University of Nebraska campus and took Victim 1 to the Red Roof Inn, where he subjected Victim 1 to sexual penetration. Xia was 27 years of age and Victim 1 was 15 years of age. It is a crime under Nebraska State law for someone over the age of 25 to subject someone between the ages of 12 and 16 to sexual penetration. Immediately following this incident, Xia continued to message Victim 1 on WeChat regarding the July 11 incident.\n\nThis case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Omaha Police Department, the University of Nebraska-Omaha Police Department, and the Lincoln Police Department.",

Demers.\u00a0 \u201cMr. Ang is alleged to have demonstrated neither when he failed to disclose his financial and other ties to companies and institutions in China to the University of Arkansas and to U.S. government agencies, despite an obligation to do so.\u00a0 This is a hallmark of the China\u2019s targeting of research and academic collaborations within the United States in order to obtain U.S. technology illegally. The Department of Justice will continue to work with colleges and universities to protect U.S. research and development from exploitation by foreign powers and will prosecute those who defraud the U.S. Government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis case is the result of the tireless efforts of our Federal law enforcement partners at the FBI and the State Department,\u201d stated Acting U.S. Attorney Fowlkes for the Western District of Arkansas. \u201cThe wire fraud in this case affected not only the University of Arkansas, but also several other important United States Government Agencies such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the United States Air Force. It is our sincere hope that this investigation sends a strong message to those who would attempt to defraud the Federal Government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe significant federal charges leveled against Simon Ang demonstrate how real the PRC\u2019s pervasive threat is to Arkansan innovation and businesses,\u201d said FBI Little Rock Special Agent in Charge Diane Upchurch. \u201cOur counterintelligence agents work tirelessly to protect our state\u2019s economy from foreign adversaries. Throughout this investigation, we were proud to partner with the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations, NASA\u2019s Office of Inspector General, the Diplomatic Security Service and prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office of the Western District of Arkansas.\u201d\n\nAng was a professor and researcher at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, Arkansas since 1988.\u00a0 At the University of Arkansas, Ang served as the Director of the High Density Electronics Center (HiDEC) until on or about May 8, 2020.\u00a0 During his employment with the University of Arkansas and as director of the HiDEC, Ang was the investigator and co-investigator for many grant contracts that were funded by United States Government Agencies. \u00a0Annually, the University of Arkansas required Ang to disclose any conflicts of interest, including outside employment.\u00a0 Agents working with the FBI discovered that Ang received money and benefits from China and was closely associated with various companies based in China during the same time that he was receiving grants from various United States Government Agencies.\u00a0 The agents discovered that Ang did not disclose these conflicts of interest, even when specifically required to do so by the University of Arkansas and NASA, one of the agencies that awarded Ang and his research associates a Federal grant.\n\nThe indictment charges that beginning as early as June 9, 2013, and continuing to on or about May 8, 2020, in the Western District of Arkansas, and elsewhere, Ang, knowingly and willfully devised and intended to devise a scheme and artifice to defraud and to obtain money and property from unknowing United States Government Agencies, the University of Arkansas, and others by means of material false and fraudulent pretenses, representations and promises and the concealment of material facts for the purpose of obtaining money and intellectual property that he would not have received had the University of Arkansas and other government authorities known the facts involved in his scheme and artifice to defraud.\n\nThe indictment also charges Ang with two counts of making false statements on a passport renewal application. Specifically, the indictment states that on or about Aug. 5, 2019, in the Western District of Arkansas, Ang, willfully and knowingly made a false statements in an application for a passport with intent to induce and secure for his own use the issuance of a passport under the authority of the United States, contrary to the laws regulating the issuance of such passports and the rules prescribed pursuant to such laws, in that in such application the defendant stated that he was not known by any names other than \u201cSimon Saw-Teong Ang,\u201d which statement he knew to be false. The indictment also charges that Ang also listed immediate travel plans for a trip to Singapore with a departure date of Aug. 30, 2019 and a return date of Sept. 7, 2019, which statement he knew also to be false.\n\nIf convicted, Ang faces a statutory maximum punishment of 20 years in prison for each wire fraud count and 10 years in federal prison for each passport fraud count. \u00a0If convicted, Ang\u2019s sentence will be determined by the court after review of factors unique to this case, including Ang\u2019s prior criminal record (if any), Ang\u2019s role in the offense and the characteristics of the violations.\n\nThe FBI and the State Department\u2019s Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) is investigating the case. \u00a0Acting U.S. Attorney David Clay Fowlkes from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Arkansas and Trial Attorneys Michael Eaton and Ali Ahmad from the National Security Division are prosecuting the case.\n\nAn indictment is merely an accusation.\u00a0 An arrest warrant represents a finding of probable cause. \u00a0\u00a0A person is presumed innocent unless or until he or she is proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.",

            "article_text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio \u2013 A rheumatology professor and researcher with strong ties to China was sentenced to 37 months in prison for making false statements to federal authorities as part of an immunology research fraud scheme.\n\n\n\nAs part of his sentence, Song Guo Zheng, 58, of Hilliard, was also ordered to pay more than $3.4 million in restitution to the National Institute of Health (NIH) and approximately $413,000 to The Ohio State University.\n\n\n\nZheng was arrested Friday, May 22, 2020, after he arrived in Anchorage, Alaska, aboard a charter flight and as he prepared to board another charter flight to China.\n\n\n\nWhen he was arrested, Zheng was carrying three large bags, one small suitcase and a briefcase containing two laptops, three cell phones, several USB drives, several silver bars, expired Chinese passports for his family, deeds for property in China and other items.\n\n\n\nHe was transported to the Southern District of Ohio and made his first federal court appearance in Columbus on July 7, 2020.\n\n\n\nZheng pleaded guilty in November 2020 and admitted he lied on applications in order to use approximately $4.1 million in grants from NIH to develop China\u2019s expertise in the areas of rheumatology and immunology.\n\n\n\nZheng was a professor of internal medicine who led a team conducting autoimmune research at The Ohio State University and Pennsylvania State University. According to his plea, Zheng caused materially false and misleading statements on NIH grant applications, seeking to hide his participation in Chinese Talent Plans and his affiliation and collaboration with a Chinese university controlled by the Chinese government.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn yet another case involving the Chinese Government\u2019s Thousand Talents program, Song Guo Zheng will spend the next 37 months in a federal prison because he chose to lie and hide his involvement in this program from U.S. research funding agencies,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers.\u00a0 \u201cAmerican research funding is provided by the American taxpayer for the benefit of American society\u2014not as an illicit gift to the Chinese Government. \u00a0The American people deserve total transparency when federal dollars are being provided for research, and we will continue to hold accountable those who choose to lie about their foreign government affiliations in an attempt to fraudulently gain access to these funds.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFor years the defendant concealed his participation in Chinese government talent recruitment programs, hiding his affiliations with at least five research institutions in China,\" said Alan E. Kohler, Jr., Assistant Director of the FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Division. \"Zheng greedily took federal research dollars and prevented others from receiving funding for critical research in support of medical advances. The FBI will continue to pursue people wherever they may be, even on a plane, in Alaska, in the middle of the night.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe hope Zheng\u2019s prison sentence deters others from having anything to do with China\u2019s so-called \u20181000 Talents Plan\u2019 or any of its variations, said Acting U.S. Attorney Vipal J. Patel.\u00a0\u201cStealing is stealing, but stealing at the behest of a foreign government\u2019s concerted effort to pilfer our nation\u2019s innovations and technology takes things to a new and significantly worse level.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cZheng\u2019s sentencing today is a recognition of the constant threat posed by the Chinese government to steal research funded by American taxpayers,\u201d stated FBI Cincinnati Special Agent in Charge Chris Hoffman. \u201cZheng\u2019s failure to disclose his foreign funding and support damages the trust and undermines the credibility the American people place in U.S. research, while abusing the openness and transparency that is a core value of U.S. academia. This sentence should serve as a deterrent and underscores the FBI\u2019s commitment to work with our partners to investigate individual\u2019s whose actions throw a cloud over the cutting-edge work being done at U.S. universities.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cReporting potential conflicts of interest when seeking grant funding from the National Institutes of Health is imperative in ensuring the public\u2019s trust in the research being conducted and how it is utilized,\u201d said Lamont Pugh III, Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, Office of Inspector General \u2013 Chicago Region. \u201cMaking false statements to conceal potential conflicts violates that trust and the law. The OIG is committed to identifying and investigating instances where individuals intentionally fail to report or falsify information regarding their sources of research support in order to ensure the proper use of taxpayer dollars.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to court documents, since 2013, Zheng had been participating in a Chinese Talent Plan, a program established by the Chinese government to recruit individuals with knowledge or access to foreign technology intellectual property.\u00a0Since that time, Zheng used research conducted in the United States to benefit the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u00a0Zheng failed to disclose conflicts of interest or his foreign commitments to his American employers or to the NIH.\n\n\n\nActing U.S. Attorney Patel acknowledged the assistance of the Anchorage FBI Division who arrested Zheng, interviewed him and executed multiple warrants while he was detained, and the assistance provided by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Alaska.\n\n\n\nThis case was investigated by the FBI and Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General.\u00a0Assistant United States Attorneys Douglas W. Squires and S. Courter Shimeall, Special Assistant United States Attorney Christopher N. St. Pierre, and Trial Attorney Matthew J. McKenzie with the Department of Justice\u2019s National Security Division are representing the United States in this case. Chief U.S. District Judge Algenon L. Marbley imposed the sentence today.\n\n\n\n# # #\n\n",

Co-conspirator Gregory Mu\u00f1ozpleaded guiltyon May 9, and co-conspirator Jonathan Thyng pleaded guilty on July 23.\n\nAccording to court documents, beginning in at least July 2016 and continuing through at least May 2023, Yu ordered biochemical products from MilliporeSigma, a subsidiary of multinational science and technology company Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, with help from Mu\u00f1oz, a MilliporeSigma salesperson, by falsely representing that Yu was affiliated with a biology research lab at a large Florida university. This fictitious affiliation led MilliporeSigma to provide Yu over $4.9 million worth of discounts and other benefits, such as free overnight shipping, not available to the public. Yu gave Mu\u00f1oz thousands of dollars in gift cards for facilitating these fraudulent discounted orders. When the products arrived at the university stockroom, a stockroom employee diverted the products to Yu, who repackaged them and shipped them to China. To avoid scrutiny, Yu made false statements about the value and contents of these shipments in export documents.\n\nThis scheme continued until MilliporeSigma compliance personnel identified certain orders as suspicious, prompting the company to retain outside counsel who voluntarily disclosed the misconduct to the Department of Justice\u2019s National Security Division only a week later. MilliporeSigma made the disclosure well before its counsel had completed their investigation and understood the full nature and extent of the scheme. MilliporeSigma offered exceptional cooperation to the prosecution team, including by proactively identifying and producing documents to the Department that established probable cause to search residences and electronic devices of culpable individuals. MilliporeSigma\u2019s cooperation allowed investigators to quickly identify the individuals responsible for the scheme, including Yu, Mu\u00f1oz and Thyng, and secure their felony guilty pleas.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Matthew G.

The three defendants each pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit identification document fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft.\n\nThis morning in District Court, they three were sentenced to the following: Jones was sentenced to 60 months of federal incarceration; Bernardo was sentenced to 40 months of federal incarceration and McPhee was sentenced to 25 months of federal incarceration. In addition, each defendant will serve three years of supervised release after their respective prison terms.\n\n\u201cThese three defendants developed a sophisticated scheme to produce and sell high-quality false identification documents throughout the nation,\u201d United States Attorney Timothy J. Heaphy said today. \u201cTheir criminal enterprise was tremendously lucrative, generating profits of more than $3 million over several years. The sentences handed down today reflect how serious these crimes were. Law enforcement personnel will continue to take every available step to recover these counterfeit driver\u2019s licenses and ensure that they cannot be used to facilitate additional criminal activity.\u201d\n\n\u201cRegardless of the reasons for seeking fraudulent documents we focus to detect, deter and dismantle individuals and organizations that present an active threat to national security or public safety, and who seek to undermine the integrity of the laws and regulations of the United States,\u201d said Scot Rittenberg, Acting Special Agent in Charge, ICE Homeland Security Investigations, Washington.\n\nPreviously, Jones, McPhee and Bernardo admitted to conspiring to create high-quality, fraudulent driver\u2019s licenses out of the home they shared on Rugby Road in Charlottesville. The conspiracy, which began in 2010 and operated under the name Novel Design, produced and sold more than 25,000 fraudulent driver\u2019s licenses, primarily to college students, throughout the nation.\n\nAs part of the scheme, Jones paid commissions to students at the University of Virginia, and elsewhere, to refer his service to other students interested in obtaining fraudulent driver\u2019s licenses. He also outsourced some of the manufacturing work to companies in Bangladesh and China.\n\nDuring the entire period of time in which Novel Design was in operation, Jones, McPhee and Bernardo produced approximately 25,000 fraudulent driver\u2019s licenses for customers. They charged customers anywhere from $75 to $125 per fake license and the three obtained more than $3 million from customers. To date, over $2.7 million in assets have been seized by law enforcement.\n\nAt the height of the conspiracy, Jones, McPhee and Bernardo, were able to create fraudulent driver\u2019s licenses for the states of Arizona, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.\n\nThe investigation of the case was conducted by U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement\u2019s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HIS) Washington, the United States Postal Inspection Service, the Virginia State Police and the Virginia Attorney General\u2019s Computer Forensics Unit.

            "article_text": "A former University of Florida (UF) professor and researcher and resident of China has been indicted for fraudulently obtaining $1.75 million in federal grant money from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) by concealing support he received from the Chinese government and a company that he founded in China to profit from that research.\n\nLin Yang, 43, who resided in Tampa, Florida, at the time of the offenses, is charged with six counts of wire fraud and four counts of making false statements to an agency of the United States. The indictment, returned by a federal grand jury on Dec. 15, 2020, was unsealed today.\n\n\u201cTransparency about foreign funding sources allows federal agencies to allocate finite resources fairly.\u00a0Transparency about foreign government affiliations, like business affiliations, allows the research community and the American people to assess any impact on the integrity of the research,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers for the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division.\u00a0\u201cAccording to the indictment, the defendant intentionally deceived both his employer and the federal government in order to obtain more than a million dollars in research funding. Rather than being open about his ties to the People\u2019s Republic of China, the defendant chose to conceal them, in the process advancing both the Chinese government\u2019s strategic goals and his own financial interests. The department will continue to protect the foundations of America\u2019s research enterprise\u2014integrity and transparency.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe taxpayer dollars that funded Yang\u2019s research were intended to benefit the health and well-being of U.S. citizens. But our indictment alleges that Yang engaged in acts of deliberate deception so that he could also further the research goals of the Chinese Communist government and advance his own business interests,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Lawrence Keefe for the Northern District of Florida. \u201cWe are committed to working closely with the FBI, the Department of Health and Human Services, and our research institutions to identify, investigate and prosecute anyone who undermines the integrity of our nation\u2019s research efforts by concealing potential conflicts of interest and commitment.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerican taxpayers ought to know whether their money is being used to fund research and development for the benefit of foreign governments and foreign companies,\u201d said Assistant Director Alan E. Kohler Jr. of the FBI's Counterintelligence Division. \u201cThe FBI will always investigate those who break the law by taking federal money while hiding their foreign business and government ties. In doing so, we\u2019re ensuring transparency and protecting the hard-earned dollars of the American public.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States can benefit greatly from hosting foreign researchers in our academic institutions, but this case illustrates how that collaborative environment can also be exploited,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Rachel L. Rojas of the FBI Jacksonville Division.\u00a0\u201cThe Chinese Communist government simply does not play by the same rules of academic integrity that we do.\u00a0The FBI is committed to holding its proxies accountable, and to helping educational institutions protect cutting-edge research and technologies from foreign adversaries who are determined to defeat the U.S. at any cost.\u201d\n\n\u201cTaxpayers fund medical research in the hope that promising scientific breakthroughs will result in much-needed treatments and cures for patients.\u00a0Such funding should be based on a transparent understanding of potential conflicts of interest and commitment,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge\u00a0Omar P\u00e9rez Aybar\u00a0of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG). \u201cWorking with our law enforcement partners, we will assiduously investigate rogue researchers who conceal their foreign support.\u201d\n\nAccording to the indictment, Yang obtained a $1.75 million grant from NIH to develop and disseminate an imaging informatics tool for muscles known as \u201cMuscleMiner.\u201d Between September 2014 and July 2019, Yang served as the principal investigator for the NIH grant at UF. As the principal investigator, Yang was responsible for conducting and administering the grant in compliance with applicable federal law and institutional policies. Among other things, Yang was required to disclose his foreign research support and financial conflicts of interest, including his ownership of, or interest in, a foreign company.\n\nDuring that same period, in 2016, Yang established a business in China known as \u201cDeep Informatics.\u201d The indictment further alleges that Yang promoted his business in China by relating that its products were the result of years of research supported by millions of dollars of U.S. government funding. Simultaneously, Yang applied for and was accepted into the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s Thousand Talents Program (TTP) in connection with Northwestern Polytechnical University, located in Xi\u2019an, China. The TTP was a talent plan established by the Chinese government to encourage the transfer of original ideas, technology, and intellectual property from foreign institutions, such as American universities.\n\nIn order to maintain his employment with UF and continue receiving NIH grant money, the indictment alleges that Yang intentionally concealed his conflicts of interest and other support in connection with his Chinese business and his participation in a Chinese government talent plan and affiliation with a Chinese research university. On multiple occasions, Yang submitted disclosures to NIH containing false statements and material omissions concerning his affiliations and research endeavors with a foreign government and company. Additionally, in January 2019, UF\u2019s College of Engineering required all faculty to provide, in writing, updated disclosures concerning activities with foreign entities in China and two other countries. The indictment alleges that Yang provided UF with a written response that falsely stated he had no affiliation with any business, entity, or university in China.\n\nYang traveled to China in August of 2019 and has yet to return to the United States.\n\nEach count of wire fraud carries a maximum sentence of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment and a $250,000 fine. Each count of making false statements to an agency of the United States is punishable by a maximum sentence of five years\u2019 imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.\n\nThe FBI Jacksonville Division and HHS-OIG\u00a0investigated the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen M. Kunz for the Northern District of Florida is prosecuting the case with assistance from the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence & Export Section.\n\nThe charges contained in the indictment are only allegations. A defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.",

            "article_text": "SALT LAKE CITY\u2013 After six years of leadership as the United States Attorney for the District of Utah, America\u2019s longest currently serving U.S. Attorney is moving on. John Huber\u2019s last day as the United States Attorney is February 28. Huber was first nominated to the post by President Barack Obama, and was confirmed by the United States Senate in June of 2015. He was later re-nominated by President Donald J. Trump, and unanimously confirmed by the Senate for another four-year term as U.S. Attorney beginning in 2017.\n\nDuring his time as United States Attorney, Huber served as a close advisor to three Attorneys General and served as the Vice-Chair of the Attorney General\u2019s Advisory Committee for Attorney General Jeffrey Sessions and Attorney General William Barr. Huber also led the Attorney General\u2019s Advisory Subcommittee on Terrorism and National Security and the interagency Domestic Terrorism Executive Committee in Washington D.C.\n\nDuring his tenure, the cases prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Utah increased in numbers, complexity, and notoriety. Huber transformed the culture of the office while preaching productivity, and oversaw the physical move of the office in downtown Salt Lake City.\n\nOn the national security front, Huber oversaw the prosecution of two international terrorists in Utah; many domestic terrorism matters; and a former United States Government employee acting as a spy for China. Huber also spoke regularly on the Department of Justice\u2019s China Initiative in order to educate leaders of Utah industry on the threat posed by China.\n\nOn the violent crime front, Huber launched the Utah Gang Initiative within the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. Under his leadership, the office has prosecuted several high-profile gang cases, including that of the nationally known white supremacist gangs Soldiers of Aryan Culture and Silent Aryan Nation. In addition, federal prosecutors have led high level prosecutions against the Norteno and the Glen Mob Street Gangs and numerous other gangs along the Wasatch Front with connections to Mexican drug cartels.\n\nProsecutors in his office successfully prosecuted what was the largest illicit dark web trafficker of fentanyl-laced oxycodone in the United States and obtained a lengthy prison sentence against a Utah doctor who illegally prescribed opioids to drug addicts. Huber also prioritized cases involving child victims and his office brought numerous cases involving the exploitation of minors, including the conviction of an ex-Ute Tribal leader who sexually abused a girl starting at the age of 10.\n\nHuber was also a proponent of using targeted federal, state, and local partnerships to combat violent crime in urban areas. Huber helped to lead a violent crime reduction partnership in Ogden, Utah, that contributed to the decrease in violent crime by as much as 30% and helped to create a similar partnership that is ongoing in Salt Lake City.\n\nHuber also reached out to all of Utah\u2019s rural counties and offered to prosecute criminals that had disproportionate impacts on their communities. One of the most important prosecutions during his tenure was convicting the murderer of Millard County Deputy Sheriff Josie Greathouse-Fox, a case that Huber says \u201cwill impact him for the rest of his life.\u201d\n\nOn the financial crime front, the United State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office took on record-breaking fraud schemes in Utah. Huber\u2019s office played a role in the prosecution of Northern Utah\u2019s Kingston Polygamist Clan, which defrauded the United States out of close to $500 million dollars, as well as the prosecution of Lyle Jeffs and members of the Fundamentalist LDS Church in Southern Utah, who were found to have defrauded the United States\u2019 Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Prosecutors in his office obtained a conviction and a lengthy prison sentence against Rick Koerber, and have now turned their sites on the pending Rust Rare Coin case, a case that prosecutors allege is one of the largest and most destructive frauds Utah has ever seen.\n\nOn the civil side, Huber\u2019s office successfully fought to keep snowboarders out of Alta Ski Resort, a decision that still garners mixed reviews amongst snowboarders in Utah. In addition, the office engaged in important civil rights work related to Utah\u2019s public universities; \u00a0successfully held doctors and pharmacies accountable in the midst of the opioid epidemic; and engaged in numerous cases related to the misuse of taxpayer funds amidst the global pandemic.\n\nOf all of his accomplishments, Huber is most proud of the fact that he has hired over 50 percent of the office\u2019s nearly 60 prosecutors. This, Huber says, will be his most important legacy, as he will be \u201cextremely proud to see all that they will accomplish on behalf of the United States of America.\u201d\n\nLeaders in the law enforcement community offered accolades regarding U.S. Attorney Huber\u2019s Service.\n\n\u201cFor the past six years, John Huber has been a valuable partner and a strong supporter of the FBI and our mission,\u201d said Acting Special Agent in Charge Robert Meacham of the Salt Lake City FBI.\u00a0\u201cAs Utah's U.S. Attorney, Huber had a genuine interest in keeping our communities safe.\u00a0He never hesitated to devote resources to aggressively investigate and prosecute cases, from gangs and drugs to fraud, and national security threats.\u00a0He was hard on crime but maintained a personable relationship with those of us in the law enforcement community.\u00a0All of us at FBI Salt Lake City wish him the best in his future endeavors.\u201d\n\nUnited States Marshal for the District of Utah, Matthew Harris stated that \u201cwhat I respect the most about John, is that he is the same imperturbable man he was nearly two decades ago when I first met him, a dedicated public servant of the highest moral character, who used the ascendancy of his position, not to enrich himself, but to make Utah a safer place for its citizens. Not only was John a friend of federal law enforcement, but he earned the respect of local and state officials by helping remove the most violent criminals from their communities.\u00a0 He is the epitome of what Americans should expect from their U.S. Attorney. His leadership will be greatly missed.\u201d\n\nSpecial Agent in Charge of the ATF Denver Field Division David S. Booth stated that \u201cMr. Huber is a strong advocate for ATF and violence related prosecutions, especially those cases involving the use of firearms. This stance has led to a marked reduction in violent crime in the State of Utah. The collaboration between ATF and the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Utah under Mr. Huber has led to hundreds of violent criminals being taken off the streets and has made Utah a safer place. John balances this approach with absolute respect for fairness and an unwavering adherence to equal justice under the law. ATF has been proud to partner with Mr. Huber. He is a true defender of the law and a public servant to the people of Utah. He is professional, passionate, knowledgeable, and someone whose vision of serving the people of Utah mirrors ATF\u2019s core mission of fighting violent crime.\u201d\n\nMichael J. Tinkler, Assistant Special Agent in Charge of the Salt Lake City Drug Enforcement Agency stated that \u201con behalf of the Drug Enforcement Administration, \u00a0I would like to thank U.S. Attorney John Huber for his outstanding support and partnership with the Salt Lake City District Office and the Metro Narcotics Task Force. John has been a friend and mentor to many throughout these past six years and will be sorely missed. During his tenure, several significant drug trafficking organizations were disrupted that directly impacted the citizens of this state and nation. His dedication to upholding the rule of law and serving others are tenets that he followed and served as a motivation for others.\u201d\n\n\u201cHomeland Security Investigations is fortunate to have U.S. Attorney John Huber as an advocate and partner in prosecuting criminals in the great state of Utah,\u201d said Steve Andres, Assistant Special Agent in Charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Utah. \u201cHis tireless advocacy for justice resulted in several significant outcomes including the successful prosecution of a North Korean state actor seeking sensitive U.S. technology, a life sentence for a major DarkWeb narcotics dealer and ensuring numerous child predators were put behind bars. \u00a0We appreciate his dedication to our shared mission of protecting the homeland and will miss his leadership.\u201d\n\n\ufeff\"Change is never easy, especially when that change brings an end to such a great working relationship. U.S. Attorney John Huber has been a great partner to our department, and I have enjoyed working with him. It is obvious he cares about the safety and security of Salt Lake City and the state of Utah,\u201d said Salt Lake City Police Chief Mike Brown.\n\nHuber graduated with honors from The University of Utah, and went on to complete his juris doctor degree at The University of Utah\u2019s S.J. Quinney College of Law. He began his public service in the Weber County Attorney\u2019s Office, and later served as the Chief Prosecutor for West Valley City before joining the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. Huber first served joined the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office as a Special Assistant United States Attorney and rose within the office to become the Executive Assistant United States Attorney until his appointment as the United States Attorney. His resignation ends a chapter of 27 years of continuous public service.",

Dorsey, Special Agent in Charge of Atlanta Field Office.\u00a0 \u201cThis sentencing is an example that federal tax crimes will not go unpunished.\u00a0 Those consequences include being a convicted felon and paying back all the taxes owed including penalties and interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur watchdog agency will continue to aggressively investigate anyone who does not adhere to agency rules regarding the disclosure of foreign funding and affiliations,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Derrick L.

            "article_text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 A federal grand jury in Spokane, Washington, returned an indictment earlier this month charging two hackers, both nationals and residents of the People\u2019s Republic of China (China), with hacking into the computer systems of hundreds of victim companies, governments, non-governmental organizations, and individual dissidents, clergy, and democratic and human rights activists in the United States and abroad, including Hong Kong and China. The defendants in some instances acted for their own personal financial gain, and in others for the benefit of the MSS or other Chinese government agencies. The hackers stole terabytes of data which comprised a sophisticated and prolific threat to U.S. networks.\n\nThe 11-count indictment alleges LI Xiaoyu (\u674e\u5578\u5b87), 34, and DONG Jiazhi (\u8463\u5bb6\u5fd7), 33, who were trained in computer applications technologies at the same Chinese university, conducted a hacking campaign lasting more than ten years to the present, targeting companies in countries with high technology industries, including the United States, Australia, Belgium, Germany, Japan, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Spain, South Korea, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Targeted industries included, among others, high tech manufacturing; medical device, civil, and industrial engineering; business, educational, and gaming software; solar energy; pharmaceuticals; defense. In at least one instance, the hackers sought to extort cryptocurrency from a victim entity, by threatening to release the victim\u2019s stolen source code on the Internet. More recently, the defendants probed for vulnerabilities in computer networks of companies developing COVID-19 vaccines, testing technology, and treatments.\n\nThe charges were announced by Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers; FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich; U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Washington William D. Hyslop; and Special Agent in Charge of the FBI\u2019s Seattle Field Division Raymond Duda.\n\n\u201cChina has now taken its place, alongside Russia, Iran and North Korea, in that shameful club of nations that provide a safe haven for cyber criminals in exchange for those criminals being \u2018on call\u2019 to work for the benefit of the state, here to feed the Chinese Communist party\u2019s insatiable hunger for American and other non-Chinese companies\u2019 hard-earned intellectual property,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s indictment demonstrates the serious consequences the Chinese Communist Party will face if it continues to deploy malicious cyber tactics to either steal what they cannot create or silence what they do not want to hear,\u201d said FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich. \u201cCybercrimes directed by the Chinese government\u2019s intelligence services not only threaten the United States but also every other country that supports fair play, international norms, and the rule of law, and it also seriously undermines China's desire to become a respected leader in world affairs. The FBI and our international partners will not stand idly by to this threat, and we are committed to holding the Chinese Communist Party accountable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe cybercrime hacking occurring here was first discovered on computers of the Department of Energy\u2019s Hanford Site in Eastern Washington. As the grand jury charged, the computer systems of many businesses, individuals and agencies throughout the United States and worldwide have been hacked and compromised with a huge array of sensitive and valuable trade secrets, technologies, data, and personal information being stolen. The hackers operated from China both for their own gain and with the assistance and for the benefit of the Chinese government\u2019s Ministry of State Security. This prosecution is occurring as a result of the combined unwavering efforts of the National Security Division of the Department of Justice, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Washington, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. We seek justice for these victims and others affected and we intend to prosecute these defendants for their alleged crimes,\u201d said U.S. Attorney William D. Hyslop for the District Eastern District of Washington.\n\n\"The complicated nature of cyber investigations is only exacerbated when the criminal is backed by the resources of a foreign government. The nature and value of the material stolen by these hackers cannot just be measured in dollars and was indicative of being state driven. This case demonstrates the FBI's dedication to pursuing these criminals no matter who is sanctioning their activities,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Raymond Duda of the FBI\u2019s Seattle Division.\n\nAccording to the indictment, to gain initial access to victim networks, the defendants primarily exploited publicly known software vulnerabilities in popular web server software, web application development suites, and software collaboration programs. In some cases, those vulnerabilities were newly announced, meaning that many users would not have installed patches to correct the vulnerability. The defendants also targeted insecure default configurations in common applications. The defendants used their initial unauthorized access to place malicious web shell programs (e.g., the \u201cChina Chopper\u201d web shell) and credential-stealing software on victim networks, which allowed them to remotely execute commands on victim computers.\n\nTo conceal the theft of information from victim networks and otherwise evade detection, the defendants typically packaged victim data in encrypted Roshal Archive Compressed files (RAR files), changed RAR file and victim documents\u2019 names and extensions (e.g., from \u201c.rar\u201d to \u201c.jpg\u201d) and system timestamps, and concealed programs and documents at innocuous-seeming locations on victim networks and in victim networks\u2019 \u201crecycle bins.\u201d The defendants frequently returned to re-victimize companies, government entities, and organizations from which they had previously stolen data, in some cases years after the initial successful data theft. In several instances, however, the defendants were unsuccessful in this regard, due to the efforts of the FBI and network defenders.\n\nThe indictment charges the defendants with conspiring to steal trade secrets from at least eight known victims, which consisted of technology designs, manufacturing processes, test mechanisms and results, source code, and pharmaceutical chemical structures. Such information would give competitors with a market edge by providing insight into proprietary business plans and savings on research and development costs in creating competing products.\n\nThe defendants are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets, which carries a maximum sentence of ten years in prison; one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; one count of unauthorized access of a computer, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; and seven counts of aggravated identity theft, which each carries a mandatory sentence of two non-consecutive years in prison. The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencings of the defendants will be determined by the assigned judge.\n\nThe investigation was conducted jointly by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Washington, the National Security Division of the Department of Justice, and the FBI\u2019s Spokane Resident Agency and San Antonio Field Office. The FBI\u2019s Cyber Division assisted in the investigation and, along with FBI\u2019s Cyber Assistant Legal Attach\u00e9s and Legal Attach\u00e9s in countries around the world, provided essential support. Numerous victims cooperated and provided valuable assistance in the investigation.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney James Goeke of the Eastern District of Washington and Trial Attorney Scott McCulloch of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting this case.\n\nThe details contained in the charging document are allegations. The defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.\n\nThe year 2020 marks the 150th anniversary of the Department of Justice.

            "article_text": "Five individual defendants and two companies pleaded guilty in Dallas to felony charges in connection with a scheme to fraudulently sell workout supplements, the Department of Justice announced today.\n\nAll of the defendants played roles in developing, manufacturing, or marketing the popular workout and weight loss supplements known as Jack3d and OxyElite Pro, which were distributed by Dallas-based dietary supplement company USPlabs. Cyril Willson, 38, of Ralston, Nebraska, and Matthew Hebert, 40, of Dallas, pleaded guilty today to introducing misbranded food into interstate commerce with the intent to defraud or mislead. Jonathan Doyle, 40, of Dallas, the president of USPlabs, pleaded guilty February 21 to conspiracy to introduce misbranded food into interstate commerce. Sitesh Patel, 35, of Irvine, California, the vice president of S.K. Laboratories, a California dietary supplement manufacturer, pleaded guilty on February 25 to conspiracy to introduce misbranded food into interstate commerce and to the introduction of misbranded food into interstate commerce. Jacobo Geissler, 42, of University Park, Texas, the CEO of USPlabs, pleaded guilty on February 28 to conspiracy to introduce misbranded food into interstate commerce. In addition, S.K. Laboratories pleaded guilty on February 25 to introduction of misbranded food into interstate commerce, and USPlabs pleaded guilty to conspiracy to introduce misbranded food into interstate commerce on March 5.\n\nThe misbranding charges all relate in part to OxyElite Pro, which was recalled in 2013 in the wake of an investigation by the Food and Drug Administration into whether the supplement caused liver injuries in consumers. All of the defendants were charged in a 2015 indictment returned by a Dallas federal grand jury in the Northern District of Texas.\n\n\u201cDietary supplement makers may not disregard the law and trick consumers about what is in their products,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt of the Department of Justice\u2019s Civil Division. \u201cConsumers are entitled to trust that the products they consume are safe. We will continue to investigate and prosecute those who enable the sale of mislabeled and potentially unsafe dietary supplements.\u201d\n\nThe indictment alleged that the defendants participated in a conspiracy to import dietary supplement ingredients from China, including the stimulant known as \u201cDMAA,\u201d using false certificates of analysis and false labeling, and then lied about the source and nature of those ingredients. According to the indictment, the defendants told some of their retailers and wholesalers that USPlabs products contained natural plant extracts, when in fact they contained a synthetic stimulant manufactured in a Chinese chemical factory. The indictment also alleged that the defendants sold some of their products without determining whether they would be safe to use. According to the indictment, USPlabs products related to the conspiracy brought the company hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nIn pleading guilty, Doyle, Geissler, and Patel admitted that they imported substances with false and misleading labeling in part to avoid law enforcement and regulatory agency attention. Willson and Hebert admitted that they helped to cause a dietary supplement to be shipped with false labeling regarding the ingredients it contained.\n\n\u201cConsumers deserve to know exactly what\u2019s in their dietary supplements,\u201d said U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas Erin Nealy Cox. \u201cWe cannot stand by as supplement companies deceive customers \u2013 especially when they use untested, suspect ingredients in their products.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmericans who choose to take dietary supplements expect that those products are safe and properly labeled,\u201d said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. \u201cDietary supplement labeling that falsely or misleadingly declares its contents presents a risk to the public, and the FDA will exercise its full authority under the law to bring to justice all those who produce and distribute misbranded dietary supplements.\u201d\n\nDoyle and Geissler pleaded guilty before U.S. Magistrate Judge Renee Harris Toliver. Patel, Willson, Hebert, S.K. Laboratories, and USPlabs pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Sam A. Lindsay. Patel faces a maximum sentence of six years\u2019 imprisonment; Doyle and Geissler face up to five years\u2019 imprisonment; and Willson and Hebert face up to three years\u2019 imprisonment. The individual defendants, together with the companies, agreed to pay criminal fines and forfeitures totaling about $60 million. The court set sentencing hearings for Willson and Hebert on July 8, 2019, for Patel and S.K. Laboratories on Aug. 12, 2019, and for USPlabs on Aug. 19, 2019.\u00a0 The remaining sentencing dates have not yet been set.\n\nThe case was investigated by FDA\u2019s Office of Criminal Investigations. The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorneys David Sullivan, Patrick Runkle, and Raquel Toledo with the Department of Justice\u2019s Consumer Protection Branch, and Assistant United States Attorneys Errin Martin and John DelaGarza of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Texas.\n\nAdditional information about the Consumer Protection Branch and its enforcement efforts may be found athttp://www.justice.gov/civil/consumer-protection-branch.

            "article_text": "Remarks as prepared for delivery\n\nAMES, IOWA\n\n\n\nThank you for that introduction, [U.S. Attorney] Kevin [Techau].\n\nAnd thank you for inviting me to speak today about the national security threats facing our nation. This event comes on the heels of a landmark week for the department\u2019s national security cyber program, and I want to start by saying a few words about our strategy and recent successes in this space.\n\nFor many years, nation states and their affiliates enjoyed what they perceived to be a cloak of anonymity when acting in cyber space. A cloak they hid behind to break our laws through cyber intrusions and to threaten our security and economic well-being. They had this perceived cloak because they thought we couldn\u2019t figure out who did it and, if we did figure it out, we would keep it a secret.\n\nLast week, we proved yet again \u2013 through a number of law enforcement actions \u2013 that we will find and expose those who threaten our national security through cyber attacks or theft.\n\nFirst and foremost, we unsealed an indictment charging seven experienced Iranian computer hackers for their roles in an extensive campaign of distributed denial of service attacks against the U.S. financial sector.\n\nThe damage was real: 46 major financial institutions attacked over 176 days, hit by as much as 140 Gigabits of data per second, costing the victims tens of millions of dollars.\n\nIn addition, one defendant is also charged with obtaining unauthorized access into the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems of the Bowman Dam, located in Rye, New York. The intrusion could have given the hacker control of the dam\u2019s water levels and flow rates if it had not been disconnected from the system for maintenance.\n\nThese attacks threatened public health and safety, and our economy. And this indictment exposes the faces and names behind the keyboards in Iran used to orchestrate these attacks against us \u2013 the attackers were employed by two computer security companies that work on behalf of the Iranian Government, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\nThat same week, we unsealed a complaint against members of the Syrian Electronic Army, for activity that sought to harm the economic and national security of the United States in the name of Syria and sought to extort law-abiding people all over the world to line their own pockets.\n\nAnd, following a successful extradition from Canada, we convicted a Chinese businessman in Los Angeles for hacking into the computer networks of U.S. defense contractors, including Boeing, and stealing sensitive information, including data related to fighter jets.\n\nLast week\u2019s announcements prove, once again, there is no free pass for nation state affiliated computer intrusions.\n\n\n\nThe Role of the National Security Division\n\nDisrupting these national security threats is among the highest priorities of the Department of Justice and the National Security Division. Let me share a bit of background on the National Security Division, and what our experience combatting the threat of terrorism has taught us about combating other national security threats, including threats to our national assets.\n\nThe September 11thterrorist attacks showed us that putting walls up between foreign intelligence and law enforcement makes connecting the dots of a plot very difficult. So a decade ago, Congress created the department\u2019s first new litigating division in almost half a century, the National Security Division.\n\nWe ensure unity of purpose in the department\u2019s number-one mission \u2013 to protect against terrorism and other threats to our national security. And we unite prosecutors and law enforcement officials with intelligence attorneys and the intelligence community, to ensure that we approach national security threats using every tool and resource available to the federal government.\n\nIn the years since National Security Division\u2019s creation, it is increasingly clear that the factors that motivated our creation and guided our efforts to combat terrorism are equally true in our efforts to protect our valuable national assets.\n\nAs with counterterrorism, we realized that prosecution is only one of the many tools the U.S. government brings to bear. So the National Security Division restructured and adapted to support a whole-of-government approach to national security cyber threats. Criminal prosecutions, sanctions, trade pressure and diplomatic options are just some of the responses available to us as we combat online threats to the national security.\n\nUnderlying all of the government\u2019s policy options is the need for attribution \u2013 to attribute online intrusions with confidence, down to the country, government agency, organization or even individuals involved.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies and the Department of Justice are uniquely well suited for these kinds of investigations. And these investigations are the bedrock of our whole-of-government approach because they facilitate the use of so many other tools that promote deterrence.\n\nIn some cases, attribution leads to public charges and a criminal prosecution. In other cases, a prosecution may not be the right option, but attribution opens the door for sanctions, disruption operations and bilateral diplomacy.\n\nOur attorneys live by that whole-of-government approach. \u00a0We work with our government partners to pick the best tool or combination of tools to get the job done under the rule of law.\n\nWe ensure that we have the necessary expertise no matter who is behind the threat, what their motivation is or what tool we need to use.\n\nUnder unified NSD leadership, we have integrated the department\u2019s full range of national security expertise under one roof, bringing varied skills and knowledge to the full range of national security challenges.\n\n\n\nThe Threats to our National Assets\n\nThe threat landscape we face is ever-changing and evolving, and while our top priority remains combating terrorism, we have also sharpened our focus and increased our attention on the emerging threats to our national assets, including the threat of economic espionage.\n\nAnd we have seen that these threats are not confined to banks in New York or defense contractors in California. Our entire nation, including America\u2019s heartland here in Iowa, is under constant attack from foreign adversaries and competitors who try to steal trade secrets and other intellectual property, at the expense of our economy and national security.\n\nWhen certain foreign entities eager for sensitive and valuable information can\u2019t buy it, they may take another approach: they try to steal it. Corporate theft can occur through insiders employed by a company \u2013 or it can occur remotely, through cyber intrusions that exploit a vulnerability present in a company\u2019s networks. Companies must be ready for all of these vectors of vulnerability.\n\nIowa is a fitting place to address these topics. Iowa\u2019s agricultural and food production, renewable energy, biotechnology and advanced manufacturing are an integral part of the country\u2019s economic engine. Between 2002 and 2011, Iowa\u2019s agricultural production grew over 200 percent. This growth is attributable in part to the tremendous innovation that is taking place\n\nin the American agriculture sector. According to one government study, agricultural biotech accounts for $80 billion of a $260 billion biotechnology sector.\n\nYou are revolutionizing the way America grows crops. You invest in biotechnology research to develop higher-yielding, drought-resistant crops. You rely on data from sophisticated soil sensors, satellites and drones to optimize the use of water and pesticides.\n\nBut, while you spend your days innovating, others spend their days on campaigns to steal the fruits of Americans\u2019 labor.\n\nJust this year, here in Iowa, Mo Hailong, a lawful permanent resident and employee of a China-based seed company, was convicted of participating in a long-term conspiracy to steal trade secrets from DuPont Pioneer and Monsanto, for the purpose of covertly transferring the technology to China.\n\nHailong and his co-conspirators brazenly stole inbred corn seeds from production fields not far from here. Although he knew that this technology was the valuable and confidential intellectual property of DuPont Pioneer and Monsanto, he stole it for the benefit of his China-based company.\n\nThe threat of this kind of economic espionage is serious. Some estimate that, every year, the U.S. loses more than $300 billion from theft of our intellectual property. That figure is about equivalent to the current annual level of U.S. exports to Asia. Losses of that magnitude cost the American economy untold numbers of jobs.\n\nThey reduce the profit that American firms make from research and development, which in turn reduces the incentives and resources for innovation. And the activity undermines the trust between countries and companies that is necessary to do business in a globalized economy.\n\nAs companies move to digital storage, economic espionage increasingly occurs not just through insider threats but also through cyber activity. As a result of the proliferation of technology \u2013 and the myriad ways to exploit it \u2013 we face a changing world order in which lone hackers, organized crime syndicates and nation states are all increasingly able to harm our shared networks and our livelihood. Every sector of the economy is a target \u2013 agriculture, energy, financial institutions, infrastructure, entertainment and more.\n\nAnd hackers come in all shapes and sizes. We have seen state and non-state actors using the Internet to steal our intellectual property and export-controlled information at unprecedented levels.\n\nFor example, in May 2014, after a lengthy investigation, the department indicted five Chinese military officers by name for computer hacking, economic espionage and other offenses directed at American companies. The indictment describes numerous and specific instances where uniformed officers of the People's Liberation Army hacked into the computer systems of American nuclear power, metals and solar-products companies to steal trade secrets and sensitive, internal communications that could be used by Chinese companies to give them a commercial leg-up.\n\nThe investigation, and the public charges it led to, have had a lasting impact. At the time, our indictment was met with indignant denials. But a year later, after rumors circulated that additional costs might be imposed, Chinese President Xi Jinping publicly declared, during his state visit in September, that, \u201cChina strongly opposes and combats the theft of commercial secrets and other kinds of hacking attacks.\u201d The United States and China committed that neither country\u2019s government will conduct, or knowingly support, cyber-enabled theft of trade secrets or confidential business information with the intent of providing competitive advantage to companies or commercial sectors.\n\nAnd, at the G20 Summit last fall, leaders of the world\u2019s most powerful nations pledged not to conduct or support cyber economic espionage. What began with denials ended, at least for now, with a shift in international norms and a commitment from China to change its behavior.\n\nOf course, indictments of state-sponsored hackers will not, on their own, prevent all cyber theft. This is the very point of an all-tools, whole-of-government approach. We need to exert pressure on bad actors from every possible angle. Prosecutions are just one tool in the broader Justice Department approach, which is just one angle from which the U.S. can pressure nation-state actors. The ultimate success of this approach will depend on the ability of U.S. agencies and departments to strengthen and support one another\u2019s actions.\n\nWe will not stand idly by as others attempt to steal from us. We will hold them accountable \u2013 no matter who they are, where they are or the means by which they steal.\n\n\n\nPublic-Private Partnership\n\nBut we cannot do it alone. Your companies \u2013 and thus, you, have a critical role to play.\n\nIn the case of Hailong, the investigation was initiated when DuPont Pioneer security staff detected suspicious activity and alerted the FBI. DuPont Pioneer and Monsanto cooperated fully throughout the investigation, and that cooperation was essential to disrupt the theft of American technology and hold the perpetrator accountable.\n\nAs leaders in your industries, you are on the front lines defending your companies\u2019 valuable intellectual property against insider threats, cyber-attacks and other bad actors determined to erode America\u2019s status as a global leader in those fields.\n\nWe know from experience that those seeking to do us harm will look for any available vulnerability to exploit. In many cases, your adversaries have the full backing of their foreign governments and so should you.\n\nAs a nation, we must work together to deter and disrupt these threats, and to change our adversaries\u2019 calculus by increasing their cost. Our strategy must ensure there is no free pass.\n\nBut the government\u2019s response is only one half of the equation. We need your help. Our nation\u2019s crown jewels are overwhelmingly in private sector hands. And so we work with U.S. companies, across all industry sectors, to ensure that our national security interests are protected.\n\nWe have spent time and energy in face-to-face sit downs so that we may better understand the concerns and challenges facing U.S. companies, share guidance and information, and assist with protection, detection, attribution and response. We can warn companies that manufacture or sell targeted U.S. technology when certain bad actors are seeking the particular technology they make.\n\nCorporate outreach sensitizes industry to the threat they face and helps to stem the flow of sensitive technology out of the United States.\n\nThis type of cooperation is especially important with respect to cyber-enabled threats. After all, the Internet runs on private infrastructure and the hardware and software that we all use \u2013 including in the government \u2013 is developed and maintained by the private sector.\n\nAfter an attack, if an organization works with law enforcement, it puts both in the best possible position to find out exactly what happened and to remediate and prevent further damage. The evidence is often fleeting, so early notification and access to the data is extremely important.\n\nIn addition, we may have seen the same indicators of malicious activity in other attacks, so we can conclude who was responsible and identify possible impacts and means of remediation. \u00a0Importantly, it also allows us to share information with other potential victims. \u00a0One organization\u2019s vulnerability is everyone\u2019s vulnerability and it is critical that we work together.\n\nLaw enforcement may be able to use legal authorities and tools that are unavailable to non-governmental entities. Law enforcement can also enlist the assistance of international partners to locate stolen data or identify a perpetrator.\n\nThese tools and relationships can greatly increase the odds of successfully apprehending an intruder or attacker and securing lost data. Finally, this cooperation is vital to successful prosecutions that, as I explained, can prevent criminals from causing further damage to victim companies and others.\n\nA united front is critical because the threat you face includes hackers with the full backing of their governments or that are part of sophisticated, international criminal syndicates. They have backup, but so do you \u2013 because your government is here to help.\n\nLast year, we announced a new position within the National Security Division focused on outreach to the private sector. This position was created in recognition of the importance of relationships and cooperation in cybersecurity. We understand the importance of prevention and of resilience. We want to support our private sector partners, whether they simply want to establish early lines of communication or call while under the strain of a continuing network breach.\n\nThe conversations we have at these events are essential to keep our nation secure, to protect the privacy of our citizens, to enable American businesses to compete fairly in our global economy and to ensure that U.S. businesses and institutions are resilient in the face of cyber threats. While we gather here in Iowa to work together to make this country safer, our adversaries likewise gather to strategize against us. The threats are not letting up and neither will we.\n\n\n\nThanks again for inviting me. I look forward to your questions.",

I wish him well in all his future endeavors.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo serve as U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio for these past three years has been a singular honor,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Justin Herdman. \u201cThere are not many jobs where you can work every day to ensure the safety and well-being of millions of your neighbors and friends.\u00a0 Northern Ohio is where I grew up, it is where my wife and I chose to raise a family, and it is where I have always wanted to spend my entire career.\u00a0 To have been offered an opportunity to contribute, even in a small way, to the future of our community is the privilege of a lifetime.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to thank President Trump, Attorney General Sessions and Attorney General Barr for their confidence in me to lead this office.\u00a0 I would also like to thank Senator Portman and Senator Brown, both of whom originally recommended me for this position and placed their trust in my abilities to serve all residents of northern Ohio.\u00a0\u00a0 I am also deeply appreciative of the men and women of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office who have stood with me in carrying out the virtuous mission of the Justice Department. Their work and dedication to the pursuit of justice make our communities and country a better place to live.\u00a0 As a person soon to re-enter private life, I am forever grateful for their vigilance in protecting the public.\u00a0 Any credit for the accomplishments throughout my tenure as United States Attorney belongs to them and our law enforcement partners, and for that, they have my enduring thanks.\u201d\n\nThe following are notable accomplishments achieved under U.S. Attorney Herdman\u2019s leadership:\n\nEnforcement Priority: Combatting Opioids & Narcotics Overdoses\n\nAs United States Attorney, Herdman\u2019s chief priority was to focus on saving lives.\u00a0 When he began his tenure in 2017, no area demanded more attention than the opioid epidemic and narcotics overdose crisis. Using a whole-of-office approach, Herdman established a Diversion Working Group to pursue unlawfully diverted prescription painkillers across the supply chain, which resulted in the precedent-setting use of the Controlled Substances Act\u2019s civil provisions to enjoin healthcare professionals from illegal prescribing.\u00a0 \u201cI am particularly proud of the results of our Diversion Working Group,\u201d said Herdman, \u201cThe hard work of those attorneys and investigators led to numerous prosecutions, convictions, and civil suits of irresponsible healthcare workers.\u00a0 Their efforts have absolutely reduced the oversupply of prescription opioids in our district and have undoubtedly saved lives.\u201d\n\nHerdman also established a Dark Web Working Group, a multi-agency investigative team tasked with identifying online vendors of illicit narcotics, especially fentanyl and synthetic opioids, and holding them accountable.\u00a0 These efforts have led to numerous prosecutions of dark web and online drug dealers, as well as charges against the Zheng drug trafficking organization, which is based in the People\u2019s Republic of China and in July 2020 was designated under the Kingpin Act by the U.S. Department of Treasury.\u00a0 Herdman also oversaw the nationally recognized Operation Darkness Falls initiative, which was a multi-agency effort designed to identify, investigate, and prosecute the highest-profile criminal targets operating on the dark net.\u00a0 Given the record number of deaths stemming from the opioid epidemic, Operation Darkness Fall\u2019s chief focus was on combatting fentanyl and other synthetic opioid dark net distributors.\u00a0 Included among the successful prosecutions of this operation was the identification and prosecution of MH4Life, the most prolific fentanyl trafficker on the dark net, which had over 4,000 verified drug transactions on just three of the dozen dark net marketplaces where it was operating.\n\nIn October 2018, the Department of Justice announced that Cleveland would be the location of a new, multi-agency Strike Force funded by the Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Task Force.\u00a0 The Strike Force commenced operational activities in 2019 and is expected to co-locate all operations at a new Strike Force building, which will host all participating agencies, in January 2021.\n\nUnder his leadership, the office prosecuted more narcotics-related offenses in each year between 2018 and 2020 (393, 456, and 493 individual defendants, respectively) than ever before in the history of the district.\u00a0 From 2018 to 2020, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office prosecuted more than double the number of narcotics defendants than in the years 2014 to 2016.\u00a0 \u201cBehind each of these numbers is a drug trafficker, someone who sold poison to one of our neighbors, friends, or family members suffering from addiction,\u201d Herdman said, \u201cThe decision to prosecute someone on the federal level is not one that we make lightly, but the fact is that in this era, where fentanyl has killed thousands of Ohioans, there is no such thing as a low-level drug dealer. Enforcement of our nation\u2019s drug laws is a cornerstone in winning the fight against overdose deaths, and over the past three years, our office and our investigative partners have more than done our part.\u201d\n\nHerdman also brought federal resources to bear in combatting narcotics trafficking in locations outside the largest metropolitan areas.\u00a0 In 2018, Operation S.O.S. was launched in Lorain County to help stop the supply of synthetic opioids\u00a0in the area. Since that time, opioid overdose deaths in Lorain County have decreased by 31%.\u00a0 Similarly, targeted enforcement operations have been brought across the district, including in Trumbull County, Marion, Mansfield, and Lima.\u00a0 \u201cThere is no town in Ohio that has escaped the opioid epidemic,\u201d Herdman said, \u201cI\u2019m proud of the cases that we have brought in smaller cities with the cooperation of local law enforcement. The residents of Warren, Marion, Mansfield, Lorain, Elyria, and many other cities have people who are alive in this holiday season because of the cases that we have prosecuted.\u201d\n\nHerdman also continued a series of prevention efforts designed at developing collaborative, community-wide approaches to reducing overdose deaths.\u00a0 In 2018, Herdman convened a conference of leaders from healthcare, recovery, social services and law enforcement communities at the Cleveland Clinic.\u00a0 This group, which was brought together five years after a similar conference, recommended a new community action plan that established, for the first time, a team dedicated to incorporating data and analytics into the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Heroin and Opioid Task Force.\n\nThese efforts have seen success and, in some instances, dramatic improvement in the death rate associated with narcotics overdoses.\u00a0 In 2018, the district experienced the first decrease in narcotics overdoses since 2010.\u00a0 In Cuyahoga County, 2018 saw a 24-percent decrease in overdose deaths from the preceding year and that number remained relatively stable through 2019.\u00a0 Similar decreases in overdose deaths were witnessed across the district in that time span.\u00a0 \u201cDespite all evidence pointing to the impossibility of reversing the upward trend of overdose deaths, we were able to do just that in Ohio through the coordinated efforts of law enforcement, treatment and recovery professionals, the health care community, policymakers and politicians, and concerned citizens,\u201d Herdman said, \u201cWe are not out of this yet, though.\u00a0 2020 will undoubtedly see a rise in overdose deaths as COVID-19 has pushed the opioid crisis from the headlines and as our neighbors suffering from addiction have had to do so in isolation, without face-to-face help from peer counselors and recovery specialists.\u00a0 I promised to leave no stone unturned in our fight against overdose deaths.\u00a0 Our office is well-positioned to continue delivering on this solemn commitment to our community in the next year and for many years to come.\u00a0 This is a fight that we not only can win, but must win.\u201d\n\nEnforcement Priority: Reducing Violent Crime\n\nUpon becoming U.S. Attorney, Herdman established a Violent Crimes Unit and staffed it with experienced attorneys focused on prosecutions of gang members, gun traffickers, armed robbers, and carjackers.\u00a0 These efforts were supplemented by increased enforcement of illegal firearms possession, especially where guns were used to further other violent crimes or narcotics offenses.\u00a0 The number of individuals prosecuted for illegal firearms possession offenses in 2020 represented a 162% increase \u2013 almost three times as many \u2013 from the number of similar offenses prosecuted in 2016.\n\nIn both Toledo and Cleveland, the police departments were participants in the Department\u2019s Public Safety Partnerships, which provided training and technical assistance designed to improve the city\u2019s approaches to reducing violent crime.\u00a0 In 2018, the office supported Operation We-R-CLE, an enforcement operation focused on the east side of Cleveland, which resulted in the seizure of numerous firearms and arrests of the city\u2019s most violent fugitives.\u00a0 That operation resulted in a historic low for homicides in the city \u2013 2 in the month of May 2018 \u2013 and an overall decrease in violent crime across the neighborhoods selected for the initiative.\n\nIn 2019 in Youngstown, the office supported Operation Steel Penguin and Operation Rookery, violent crime reduction efforts which included a data-driven enforcement effort.\u00a0 Under these initiatives, the ATF, along with officers from the Youngstown Police Department and Ohio\u2019s Adult Parole Authority, worked together to identify violent offenders and reoffenders.\u00a0 These operations led to 109 arrests, the seizure of 45 illegally possessed firearms and an overall reduction in violent crimes during the operational period by 30% and homicides by 90% (as to compared to the preceding year).\n\nMore recently, in July of 2020, Herdman announced that Operation Legend, a collaborative law enforcement partnership, would be launched in the city of Cleveland to address increasing violent crime rates.\u00a0 Operation Legend will provide funding to support almost 40 task force officers from the Cleveland Division of Police, Ohio State Highway Patrol, the Ohio Investigative Unit, and Ohio Adult Parole, as well as permanent reassignment of additional federal agents from ATF, DEA, FBI and the U.S. Marshals Service.\u00a0 Also this past year, in response to an alarming rise in firearms violence over the summer, Herdman announced Project Red-Zone, a partnership between federal, state, and local law enforcement in Toledo and Youngstown to federally prosecute every illegal gun possession case from those locations during the operational period of the initiative.\u00a0 This effort was credited with dramatically reducing firearms violence in those cities over the Labor Day weekend in 2020.\n\n\u201cUntil this past year, our violent crime reduction efforts were making significant progress in our district\u2019s largest cities,\u201d Herdman said, \u201cWhile there is no doubt that 2020 has presented new, substantial challenges to law enforcement when it comes to violent crimes, especially shootings and homicides, I am confident that the strategies and resources that we have put in place will witness improvement in our cities\u2019 violent crime rates in 2021 and well beyond.\u201d\n\nEnforcement Priority: Prosecuting Domestic Violence Offenders\n\nAnother area of focus for Herdman was an unprecedented federal enforcement effort directed at the prosecution of domestic violence-related firearms offenders. In October of 2018, Herdman announced a new initiative on federal level domestic violence enforcement.\n\nIn the two years since that announcement, the district has seen a 300% increase in the number of firearms-related cases brought against domestic violence offenders than in previous years.\u00a0 \u201cA gun in the hand of a domestic violence offender is far more likely to be used to kill the victim in that setting, and far more likely to be used against responding law enforcement,\u201d Herdman said, \u201cI am proud of the work that we have done in addressing domestic violence on the federal level and I believe that these efforts, which were previously never the focus of federal law enforcement, have saved the lives of domestic violence victims, innocent children, and police officers.\u201d\n\nNational Security\n\nAs U.S. Attorney, Herdman also ensured that the Department of Justice\u2019s number one priority \u2013 preventing terrorism and advancing national security \u2013 was carried out in the Northern District of Ohio. \u00a0The office was responsible for disrupting several planned mass-casualty attacks, including a plan to attack downtown Cleveland on July 4, 2018 perpetrated by an individual who swore allegiance to Al Qaeda (United States v. Demetrius Pitts); a plot to attack a downtown Toledo bar and an energy pipeline (United States v. Lecron; United States v. Armstrong); an alleged plot by an ISIS-inspired individual to attack a Toledo-area synagogue (United States v. Joseph); and an alleged plot to kidnap and kill members of local law enforcement (United States v. Ferguson).\u00a0 Herdman also supervised ground-breaking prosecutions involving cybercrime, including the successful trial of a group of Romanian hackers (United States v. Nicolescu, et al., also known as the \u201cBayrob Group\u201d) and continued to oversee public-private partnerships devoted to a broad cybersecurity response in Northern Ohio.\u00a0 Herdman also initiated prosecutions stemming from the Department\u2019s China Initiative, including charges alleging a local researcher had failed to disclose financial support from the Chinese government\u2019s \u201cThousand Talents Program.\u201d\n\nFraud and Public Corruption\n\nThroughout his tenure as U.S. Attorney, Herdman has delivered on a core Justice Department principle: rooting out self-dealing by public officials.\u00a0 Notable prosecutions and charges in the area of public corruption include the following:\n\nFraudulent schemes, especially those that targeted vulnerable Ohioans and those seeking to exploit Medicaid programs and the nation\u2019s efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic, received similar attention from Herdman.\u00a0 An active participant in the Department\u2019s Elder Fraud Initiative, Herdman\u2019s office brought several charges against those who sought to exploit elderly residents of the district, including some residing in nursing homes.\u00a0 During Herdman\u2019s tenure, the office also brought charges against three women who, under the guise of operating a reputable adoption agency, are alleged to have paid bribes to foreign officials to facilitate adoptions for American families in violation of, among other laws, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).\u00a0 Charges were also brought against physicians and pharmaceutical employees who were alleged to have defrauded the Medicaid program by falsely diagnosing patients and promoting the use of specific controlled substances in exchange for kickbacks.\u00a0 Finally, Herdman has supervised a series of cases charging several individuals who allegedly defrauded the Payroll Protection Program, a federal effort to support small businesses during the pandemic, by, among other things, creating fictitious business and falsifying records to create the illusion that they were entitled to program funds.\n\nCivil Rights\n\nDuring Herdman\u2019s tenure, civil rights remained a top priority of the office.\u00a0 Herdman also became a vocal advocate for the need to address the surge in white supremacy-related violence and threats to the public.\u00a0 Notable civil rights achievements include the first-ever indictment alleging both national security violations and hate crimes offenses (United States v. Joseph).\u00a0 Near the time of this indictment in early 2019, and recognizing the growing number of threats to places of worship and those who seek to peacefully exercise their religious rights, Herdman brought more than 250 people together, including community members, religious leaders, and law enforcement representatives and agents, for a multi-denominational conversation about supporting all faiths and securing places of worship.\n\nHerdman also oversaw numerous prosecutions of individuals who used social media platforms or other internet-based communications to threaten northern Ohio residents with violence, including an individual who is alleged to have threatened a Youngstown-area Jewish Community Center (United States v. Reardon).\u00a0 With respect to human trafficking, the office remained engaged in addressing this threat to Ohioans, particularly in the area of juvenile sex trafficking.\u00a0 In Toledo and Cleveland, religious leaders have been charged with juvenile sex trafficking for allegedly paying underage boys and girls for commercial sex acts.\u00a0 Additionally, in what is the largest juvenile sex trafficking indictment brought in this district, a former Youngstown-area physician awaits trial for juvenile sex trafficking and child exploitation charges related to six juvenile victims with ages ranging from12 to 15 years.\n\nCivil enforcement of federal civil rights laws received equal attention under Herdman, as the office has prioritized policing reform efforts, prevention of disparate discipline in public schooling, enforcement of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and efforts to combat sexual harassment in housing.\u00a0 Notably, and for the first time ever in the district, the office filed a complaint for sexual harassment in housing against Toledo-area residents for allegedly engaging in abusive and harassing conduct towards vulnerable women.\u00a0 The office also entered into a settlement agreement with the Toledo Public School District, the fifth-largest school district in northern Ohio, to address and resolve disparate disciplinary practices for minority and disabled students.\n\nHerdman also oversaw the continued efforts of the Department to implement the terms of the Consent Decree with the Cleveland Division of Police and the City of Cleveland, which include revised search and seizure policies; use of force reforms and improved documentation and investigation of uses of force; and critical incident response training for specially-designated officers responding to calls for service to assist community members in times of a mental health crisis.\n\nHerdman previously served as an Assistant United States Attorney from 2006 through 2013. As an Assistant U.S. Attorney, he served as Deputy Chief of the National Security, Human Rights, and Organized Crime Unit. Prior to that, he was an Assistant District Attorney in the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office from 2001 to 2004.\n\nHerdman was nominated by President Donald Trump to serve as U.S. Attorney on June 12, 2017, and was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on August3, 2017. He took the oath of office from U.S. District Court Judge Patricia Gaughan on August 21, 2017.\n\nIn 2017, he was appointed to the Attorney General\u2019s Advisory Committee (AGAC), of which he is currently the Vice-Chair. In this role, Herdman serves as one of fifteen United States Attorneys charged with developing and offering recommendations to improve management, operations, and functions of U.S. Attorneys\u2019 offices nationwide, as well as the Department of Justice.\n\nIn 2019, Herdman was appointed to Attorney General Barr\u2019s working group focused on federal responses to Domestic Violence. He has also served as Chair of the AGAC\u2019s Terrorism & National Security Subcommittee and as a Co-Chair of the Attorney General\u2019s Prescription Interdiction and Litigation Task Force.\n\nHerdman continues to serve as a Judge Advocate in the United States Air Force Reserve and is a former intelligence officer in the United States Navy Reserve. He earned his B.A. from Ohio University, his M.Phil. from the University of Glasgow, and his J.D. from Harvard Law School.",

            "article_text": "ATLANTA \u2013 Song Wu, a Chinese national, has been indicted on charges for wire fraud and aggravated identity theft arising from his efforts to fraudulently obtain computer software and source code created by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (\u201cNASA\u201d), research universities, and private companies.\n\n\u201cEfforts to obtain our nation\u2019s valuable research software pose a grave threat to our national security,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Buchanan. \u201cHowever, this indictment demonstrates that borders are not barriers to prosecuting bad actors who threaten our national security.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce again, the FBI and our partners have demonstrated that cyber criminals around the world who are seeking to steal our companies\u2019 most sensitive and valuable information can and will be exposed and held accountable,\u201d said Keri Farley, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta. \u201cAs this indictment shows, the FBI is committed to pursuing the arrest and prosecution of anyone who engages in illegal and deceptive practices to steal protected information.\u201d\n\nAccording to U.S. Attorney Buchanan, the indictment, and other information presented in court: Song allegedly engaged in a multi-year \u201cspear phishing\u201d email campaign in which he created email accounts to impersonate U.S.-based researchers and engineers and then used those imposter accounts to obtain specialized restricted or proprietary software used for aerospace engineering and computational fluid dynamics. This specialized software could be used for industrial and military applications, such as development of advanced tactical missiles and aerodynamic design and assessment of weapons.\n\nIn executing the scheme, Song allegedly sent spear phishing emails to individuals employed in positions with the United States government, including NASA, the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Army, and the Federal Aviation Administration.\u00a0 Song also sent spear phishing emails to individuals employed in positions with major research universities in Georgia, Michigan, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Ohio, and with private sector companies that work in the aerospace field. Song\u2019s spear phishing emails appeared to the targeted victims as having been sent by a colleague, associate, friend, or other person in the research or engineering community. His emails requested that the targeted victim send or make available source code or software to which Song believed the targeted victim had access.\n\nAccording to the indictment, while conducting this spear phishing campaign, Song was employed as an engineer at Aviation Industry Corporation of China (\u201cAVIC\u201d), a Chinese state-owned aerospace and defense conglomerate headquartered in Beijing, China.\u00a0 AVIC manufactures civilian and military aircrafts and is one of the largest defense contractors in the world.\n\nSong Wu, 39, of China is charged with 14 counts of wire fraud and 14 counts of aggravated identity theft.\u00a0 Song faces a maximum statutory sentence of 20 years in prison for each count of wire fraud. Song faces a mandatory, two-year consecutive sentence in prison if convicted of aggravated identity theft.\n\nMembers of the public are reminded that the indictment only contains charges.\u00a0 The defendant is presumed innocent of the charges and it will be the government\u2019s burden to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at trial.\n\nThis case is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the NASA \u2013 Office of Inspector General.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Samir Kaushal is prosecuting the case. Within the National Security Division, this matter is being handled by Trial Attorney Tanner Kroeger of the National Security Cyber Section with assistance from the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.\n\nThis case is being coordinated by the Disruptive Technology Strike Force, an interagency law enforcement strike force co-led by the Departments of Justice and Commerce designed to target illicit actors, protect supply chains, and prevent critical technology from being acquired by authoritarian regimes and hostile nation-states. Under the leadership of the Assistant Attorney General for National Security and the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Enforcement, the Strike Force leverages tools and authorities across the U.S. Government to enhance the criminal and administrative enforcement of export control laws.\n\nFor further information please contact the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Public Affairs Office atUSAGAN.PressEmails@usdoj.govor (404) 581-6016.\u00a0 The Internet address for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Georgia ishttp://www.justice.gov/usao-ndga.",

            "article_text": "Rod J. Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General of the United States, Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, William F. Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d), and John C. Demers, Assistant Attorney General for National Security, announced today the unsealing of an indictment charging GHOLAMREZA RAFATNEJAD, EHSAN MOHAMMADI, ABDOLLAH KARIMA, a/k/a \u201cVahid Karima,\u201d MOSTAFA SADEGHI, SEYED ALI MIRKARIMI, MOHAMMED REZA SABAHI, ROOZBEH SABAHI, ABUZAR GOHARI MOQADAM, and SAJJAD TAHMASEBI.\u00a0 The defendants were each leaders, contractors, associates, hackers-for-hire, and affiliates of the Mabna Institute, an Iran-based company that was responsible for a coordinated campaign of cyber intrusions that began in at least 2013 into computer systems belonging to 144 U.S.-based universities, 176 universities across 21 foreign countries, 47 domestic and foreign private sector companies, the United States Department of Labor, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the State of Hawaii, the State of Indiana, the United Nations, and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund.\u00a0 Through the activities of the defendants, the Mabna Institute conducted these intrusions to steal over 30 terabytes of academic data and intellectual property from universities, and email inboxes from employees of victim private sector companies, government victims, and non-governmental organizations.\u00a0 The defendants conducted many of these intrusions on behalf of the Islamic Republic of Iran\u2019s (\u201cIran\u201d) Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (\u201cIRGC\u201d), one of several entities within the government of Iran responsible for gathering intelligence, as well as other Iranian government clients.\u00a0 In addition to these criminal charges, today the Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated the Mabna Institute and the nine defendants for sanctions for the malicious cyber-enabled activity outlined in the Indictment.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein said:\u00a0 \u201cThese nine Iranian nationals allegedly stole more than 31 terabytes of documents and data from more than 140 American universities, 30 American companies, five American government agencies, and also more than 176 universities in 21 foreign countries.\u00a0 For many of these intrusions, the defendants acted at the behest of the Iranian government and, specifically, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.\u00a0 The Department of Justice will aggressively investigate and prosecute hostile actors who attempt to profit from America\u2019s ideas by infiltrating our computer systems and stealing intellectual property.\u00a0 This case is important because it will disrupt the defendants\u2019 hacking operations and deter similar crimes.\u201d\n\nManhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said:\u00a0 \u201cToday, in one of the largest state-sponsored hacking campaigns ever prosecuted by the Department of Justice, we have unmasked criminals who normally hide behind the ones and zeros of computer code.\u00a0 As alleged, this massive and brazen cyber-assault on the computer systems of hundreds of universities in 22 countries, including the United States, and dozens of private sector companies and governmental organizations was conducted on behalf of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard.\u00a0 The hackers targeted innovations and intellectual property from our country\u2019s greatest minds.\u00a0 These defendants are now fugitives from American justice, no longer free to travel outside Iran without risk of arrest.\u00a0 The only way they will see the outside world is through their computer screens, but stripped of their greatest asset \u2013 anonymity.\u201d\n\nFBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said:\u00a0 \u201cThe numbers alone in this case are staggering, over 300 universities and 47 private sector companies both here in the United States and abroad were targeted to gain unauthorized access to online accounts and steal data.\u00a0 An estimated 30 terabytes was removed from universities\u2019 accounts since this attack began, which is roughly equivalent of 8 billion double-sided pages of text. \u00a0It is hard to quantify the value on the research and information that was taken from victims but it is estimated to be in the billions of dollars. The nine Iranians indicted today now find themselves wanted by the FBI and our partner law enforcement agencies around the globe \u2013 and like other cyber criminals they will soon learn their ability to freely move was just limited to the virtual world only.\u201d\n\nAccording to the allegations contained in the Indictment[1]unsealed today in Manhattan federal court:\n\nBackground on the Mabna Institute\n\nGHOLAMREZA RAFATNEJAD and EHSAN MOHAMMADI, the defendants, founded the Mabna Institute in approximately 2013 to assist Iranian universities and scientific and research organizations in stealing access to non-Iranian scientific resources.\u00a0 In furtherance of its mission, the Mabna Institute employed, contracted, and affiliated itself with hackers-for-hire and other contract personnel to conduct cyber intrusions to steal academic data, intellectual property, email inboxes and other proprietary data, including ABDOLLAH KARIMA, a/k/a \u201cVahid Karima,\u201d MOSTAFA SADEGHI, SEYED ALI MIRKARIMI, MOHAMMED REZA SABAHI, ROOZBEH SABAHI, ABUZAR GOHARI MOQADAM, and SAJJAD TAHMASEBI.\u00a0 The Mabna Institute contracted with both Iranian governmental and private entities to conduct hacking activities on their behalf, and specifically conducted the university spearphishing campaign on behalf of the IRGC.\u00a0 The Mabna Institute is located at Tehran, Sheikh Bahaii Shomali, Koucheh Dawazdeh Metri Sevom, Plak 14, Vahed 2, Code Posti 1995873351.\n\nUniversity Hacking Campaign\n\nThe Mabna Institute, through the activities of the defendants, targeted over 100,000 accounts of professors around the world.\u00a0 They successfully compromised approximately 8,000 professor email accounts across 144 U.S.-based universities, and 176 universities located in foreign countries, including Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.\u00a0 The campaign started in approximately 2013, and has continued through at least December 2017, and broadly targeted all types of academic data and intellectual property from the systems of compromised universities, including, among other things, academic journals, theses, dissertations, and electronic books.\u00a0 Through the course of the conspiracy, U.S.-based universities spent over approximately $3.4 billion to procure and access such data and intellectual property.\n\nThe hacking campaign against universities was conducted across multiple stages.\u00a0 First, the defendants conducted online reconnaissance of university professors, including to determine these professors\u2019 research interests and the academic articles they had published.\u00a0 Second, using the information collected during the reconnaissance phase, the defendants created and sent spearphishing emails to targeted professors, which were personalized and created so as to appear to be sent from a professor at another university.\u00a0 In general, those spearphishing emails indicated that the purported sender had read an article the victim professor had recently published, and expressed an interest in several other articles, with links to those additional articles included in the spearphishing email.\u00a0 If the targeted professor clicked on certain links in the email, the professor would be directed to a malicious Internet domain named to appear confusingly similar to the authentic domain of the recipient professor\u2019s university.\u00a0 The malicious domain contained a webpage designed to appear to be the login webpage for the victim professor\u2019s university.\u00a0 It was the defendants\u2019 intent that the victim professor would be led to believe that he or she had inadvertently been logged out of his or her university\u2019s computer system, prompting the victim professor for his or her login credentials.\u00a0 If a professor then entered his or her login credentials, those credentials were then logged and captured by the hackers.\n\nFinally, the members of the conspiracy used stolen account credentials to obtain unauthorized access to victim professor accounts, through which they then exfiltrated intellectual property, research, and other academic data and documents from the systems of compromised universities, including, among other things, academic journals, theses, dissertations, and electronic books.\u00a0 The defendants targeted data across all fields of research and academic disciplines, including science and technology, engineering, social sciences, medical, and other professional fields.\u00a0 At least approximately 31.5 terabytes of academic data and intellectual property from compromised universities were stolen and exfiltrated to servers under the control of members of the conspiracy located in countries outside the United States.\n\nIn addition to stealing academic data and login credentials for university professors for the benefit of the Government of Iran, the defendants also sold the stolen data through two websites, Megapaper.ir (\u201cMegapaper\u201d) and Gigapaper.ir (\u201cGigapaper\u201d).\u00a0 Megapaper was operated by Falinoos Company (\u201cFalinoos\u201d), a company controlled by ABDOLLAH KARIMA, a/k/a \u201cVahid Karima,\u201d the defendant, and Gigapaper was affiliated with KARIMA.\u00a0 Megapaper sold stolen academic resources to customers within Iran, including Iran-based public universities and institutions, and Gigapaper sold a service to customers within Iran whereby purchasing customers could use compromised university professor accounts to directly access the online library systems of particular United States-based and foreign universities.\n\nPrior to the unsealing of the Indictment, the FBI provided foreign law enforcement partners with detailed information regarding victims within their jurisdictions, so that victims in foreign countries could be notified and so that foreign partners could assist in remediation efforts.\n\nPrivate Sector Hacking Victims\n\nIn addition to targeting and compromising universities, the Mabna Institute defendants targeted and compromised employee email accounts for at least approximately 36 United States-based private companies, and at least approximately 11 private companies based in Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, and exfiltrated entire email mailboxes from compromised employees\u2019 accounts.\u00a0 Among the United States-based private sector victims were three academic publishers, two media and entertainment companies, one law firm, 11 technology companies, five consulting firms, four marketing firms, two banking and/or investment firms, two online car sales companies, one healthcare company, one employee benefits company, one industrial machinery company, one biotechnology company, one food and beverage company, and one stock images company.\n\nIn order to compromise accounts of private sector victims, members of the conspiracy used a technique known as \u201cpassword spraying,\u201d whereby they first collected lists of names and email accounts associated with the intended victim company through open source Internet searches.\u00a0 Then, they attempted to gain access to those accounts with commonly-used passwords, such as frequently used default passwords, in order to attempt to obtain unauthorized access to as many accounts as possible.\u00a0 Once they obtained access to the victim accounts, members of the conspiracy, among other things, exfiltrated entire email mailboxes from the victims.\u00a0 In addition, in many cases, the defendants established automated forwarding rules for compromised accounts that would prospectively forward new outgoing and incoming email messages from the compromised accounts to email accounts controlled by the conspiracy.\n\nU.S. Government and NGO Hacking Victims\n\nIn the same time period as the university and private sector hacking campaigns described above, the Mabna Institute also conducted a computer hacking campaign against various governmental and non-governmental organizations within the United States.\u00a0 During the course of that campaign, employee login credentials were stolen by members of the conspiracy through password spraying.\u00a0 Among the victims were the following, all based in the United States:\u00a0 the United States Department of Labor, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the State of Hawaii, the State of Indiana, the State of Indiana Department of Education, the United Nations, and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund.\u00a0 As with private sector victims, the defendants targeted for theft email inboxes of employees of these organizations.\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0

SADEGHI, SEYED ALI MIRKARIMI, MOHAMMED REZA SABAHI, ROOZBEH SABAHI, ABUZAR GOHARI MOQADAM, and SAJJAD TAHMASEBI, the defendants, are citizens and residents of Iran. \u00a0Each is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusions, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; two counts of unauthorized access of a computer, each of which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; two counts of wire fraud, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; and one count of aggravated identity theft, which carries a mandatory sentence of two years in prison.\u00a0 The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencings of the defendants will be determined by the assigned judge.\n\nMr. Berman praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI, the assistance of the United Kingdom\u2019s National Crime Agency (NCA), and the support of the OFAC.\u00a0 The case is being handled by the Office\u2019s Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit.\u00a0 Assistant United States Attorneys Timothy T. Howard, Jonathan Cohen, and Richard Cooper are in charge of the prosecution, with assistance provided by Heather Alpino and Jason McCullough of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.\n\nThe charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\n\n[1]As the introductory phrase signifies, the entirety of the text of the Indictment, and the description of the Indictment set forth herein, constitute only allegations, and every fact described should be treated as an allegation.",

            "article_text": "United States Attorney Matthew D. Krueger announced that he will resign from his position as the chief law enforcement officer for the Eastern District of Wisconsin on February 20, 2021.\u00a0 After his departure, Krueger plans to join a private law firm.\u00a0 Richard G. Frohling, who has served as the First Assistant U.S. Attorney during Krueger\u2019s tenure, will become the Acting U.S. Attorney.\n\n\"Serving as United States Attorney has been the greatest privilege of my professional life,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Krueger.\u00a0 \u201cIn the past three years, we faced unprecedented challenges, including the longest government shutdown in history, a global pandemic, and turbulent civil unrest.\u00a0 The dedicated professionals in the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, together with our selfless federal, tribal, state, and law enforcement partners, met each challenge with grit, integrity, and an unwavering commitment to justice.\u00a0 I could not be more grateful or proud to have worked alongside such talented and committed public servants.\u201d\n\nThe Eastern District of Wisconsin comprises 28 counties with a population of approximately 3.3 million people.\u00a0 The United States Attorney\u2019s Office (\u201cthe Office\u201d), with locations in Milwaukee and Green Bay, has over 80 employees, including attorneys and support staff.\u00a0 The Office and is responsible for conducting all criminal and civil litigation in the district involving the United States government.\n\n\u201cU.S. Attorney Krueger has been a true partner in our joint law enforcement mission of keeping the citizens of Wisconsin safe,\u201d said FBI Special Agent in Charge Robert Hughes.\u00a0 \u201cWe wish him the best of luck in all of his future endeavors.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnited States Attorney Krueger has always represented the citizens of the Eastern District of Wisconsin with poise and professionalism,\u201d complimented ATF Special Agent in Charge Kristen de Tineo of the Chicago Field Division. \u00a0\u201cHis dedication to ensuring the safety of the communities he served was always his first priority, and I wish him continued success in his future endeavors.\u201d\n\n\u201cMatt Krueger has honorably served as United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, tirelessly working to protect communities from the effects of drug trafficking and drug-related violence,\u201d said Robert J.

Jason Ludkeet al.; U.S. v. Waheba Dais).\u00a0The Office confronted the growing threat of cyber crime, successfully prosecuting individuals such as Marcus Hutchins, who created banking malware that affected victims worldwide.\u00a0 The Office also secured the conviction of Resit Tavin, a Turkish businessman, for smuggling Wisconsin-made marine products to Iran for use in the Iranian navy.\u00a0 Building on DOJ\u2019s China Initiative, Krueger worked with the FBI to initiate outreach to businesses at risk of economic espionage.\n\nPublic Corruption.The Office brought important cases to protect government integrity under U.S. Attorney Krueger\u2019s tenure.\u00a0 These included convictions of a corporation and six individuals\u2014including an accountant whose trial Krueger handled personally-- for a wide-ranging scheme to illegally obtain over $260 million in federal contracts that were set aside for minority-owned and disabled veteran-owned small businesses (U.S. v. Ganos).\u00a0 The Office also successfully prosecuted Nicole Doxator, a Milwaukee County employee, for diverting public funds; Willie Wade, a former Milwaukee alderman, for a fraud scheme in which he purported to sell access to a current alderman; and John LaFave, the Milwaukee County Register of Deeds for a scheme to subvert the County\u2019s procurement rules.\n\nHealthcare Fraud.Given the $1.2 trillion in annual federal healthcare spending, U.S. Attorney Krueger prioritized healthcare fraud enforcement.\u00a0 He created a dedicated team of prosecutors to pursue healthcare fraud using civil and criminal enforcement tools.\u00a0 The Office also improved its use of data analytics to identify indicia of fraud.\u00a0 As a result, the Office increased its healthcare fraud cases, including a settlement with Aurora Health Care, Inc. for improper payments to physicians, a settlement with Walgreens Co. for improper prescription drug claims, and multiple cases of illegal kickback schemes (U.S. v. Center for Pain Management, S.C.; U.S. v. Advanced Pain Management; U.S. v. David Guerrero).\n\nFinancial Fraud.The Office also successfully prosecuted a range of fraud that victimized the private sector, including a $9 million \u201cgreen energy\u201d investment scheme (U.S. v. Ronald Van Den Heuvel), and a $30 million scheme involving financing of luxury vehicles (U.S. v. Albert Golant).\u00a0 The Office placed particular emphasis crimes that targeted vulnerable victims such the elderly (U.S. v. Edward Matthes; U.S. v. Chris Kubiak; U.S. v.

Steven Kotsonis; Mehran Heydarpour civil settlement; U.S. v. Lisa Hofschulz).\u00a0 With partners, the Office launched a public awareness campaign and hosted two statewide Opioid and Meth Summits that brought together over 600 treatment, prevention, and enforcement professionals.\u00a0 In multiple cases, the Office brought charges to take down largescale drug-trafficking organizations with ties to Puerto Rico and Mexico, as well as traffickers on the dark web.\n\nCivil Rights.\u00a0 Under U.S. Attorney Krueger\u2019s leadership, the Office continued DOJ\u2019s proud legacy of protecting civil rights.\u00a0 With the rise of extremist ideologies, the Office charged Chadwick Grubbs for threatening the Jewish Community Center and Yousef Barasneh for vandalizing a synagogue.\u00a0 The Office continued its long-standing practices of reviewing law enforcement officers\u2019 use of force.\u00a0 The Office actively enforced the Americans with Disabilities Act, obtaining agreements from businesses to provide accommodations and restitution to victims.\u00a0 The Office conducted outreach to raise awareness about racial and national origin discrimination in housing; hate crimes; sexual harassment in housing; voting rights; and illegal burdens on religious freedom.\n\nHuman Trafficking & Child Exploitation.\u00a0 U.S. Attorney Krueger reinforced the Office\u2019s commitment to combatting human trafficking and child exploitation.\u00a0 The Office ranked among the nation\u2019s busiest in charging sex trafficking, forced labor, and child pornography offenses.\u00a0 The Office also helped lead an interagency human trafficking task force, contributed to trainings throughout the district, and co-sponsored a statewide conference to build capacity among law enforcement and service providers.\n\nDefending the United States in Civil Litigation.The Office also continued to vigorously defend federal agencies and officials in a wide range of civil litigation.\u00a0 U.S. Attorney Krueger increased the Civil Division\u2019s personnel, enhancing the Office\u2019s ability to advance the government\u2019s interests and protect taxpayers\u2019 funds.\n\n*\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\n\nAfter being recommended by Senator Ron Johnson and Senator Tammy Baldwin, U.S. Attorney Krueger was nominated by President Trump, confirmed by the Senate unanimously, and sworn into office on February 22, 2018.\n\nBefore taking office, U.S. Attorney Krueger served nearly five years as an Assistant U.S. Attorney prosecuting both civil and criminal violations involving healthcare fraud, procurement fraud, tax fraud, bank fraud, securities fraud, and violent crime.\u00a0 He previously practiced complex trial and appellate litigation with an international law firm in Washington, DC.\n\nU.S. Attorney Krueger began his legal career as a law clerk for the Honorable Paul V.

            "article_text": "ALBUQUERQUE \u2013 Wentong Cai, 30, a  Chinese national in the United States on a student Visa, pleaded guilty this  morning to conspiracy to violate the Arms Export Control Act and the  International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) by scheming illegally to  export defense articles with military application to the People\u2019s Republic of  China.\u00a0 The guilty plea was announced by  Damon P. Martinez, U.S. Attorney for the District of New Mexico, and Tom  Hernandez, Acting Special Agent in Charge of  Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in El Paso, Texas.\n\nDuring today\u2019s change of plea hearing,  Wentong Cai pled guilty to Count 3 of a superseding indictment charging him and  his cousin, Bo Cai, 29, also a Chinese national, with a scheme to illegally  export sensors primarily manufactured for sale to the U.S. Department of  Defense for use in high-level applications, such as line-of-sight stabilization  and precision motion control systems.\u00a0  The Arms Export Control Act and the ITAR prohibit the export of  defense-related materials from the United States without obtaining a license or  written approval from the U.S. Department of State.\n\nIn his plea agreement, Wentong Cai  admitted that from March 2012 to Dec. 2013, he conspired illegally to export  sensors from the United States to China without first obtaining the required  export license.\u00a0 At the time, Wentong Cai  was a graduate student at Iowa State University studying microbiology and Bo  Cai was employed by a technology company in China.\u00a0 According to the plea agreement, Wentong Cai  and Bo Cai embarked on an illegal scheme to smuggle sensors out of the United  States to China for one of Bo Cai\u2019s customers despite knowledge that the  sensors could not be exported without a license and that the United States did  not issue licenses to export the sensors to China.\u00a0 As part of the scheme, Bo Cai enlisted  Wentong Cai to acquire the sensors under the ruse that he planned to use the  sensors in his research at Iowa State University.\n\nCourt filings indicate that the  investigation of this case began in Oct. 2013, when an undercover HSI agent  responded to Wentong Cai\u2019s overtures. After negotiations by telephone and  email, Bo Cai and Wentong Cai traveled to New Mexico in Dec. 2013, where they  obtained a sensor from undercover HSI agents and developed a plan for smuggling  the sensor out of the United States to China.\u00a0  On Dec. 11, 2013, Bo Cai was arrested at an airport in Los Angeles,  Calif., as he was preparing to board a flight to China after the sensor was  discovered concealed in a computer speaker in his luggage.\u00a0 Wentong Cai subsequently was arrested on Jan.  22, 2014, in Ames, Iowa.\n\nWentong Cai is in federal custody and  remains detained pending his sentencing hearing, which has yet to be  scheduled.\u00a0 Under the terms of his plea  agreement, Wentong Cai will be sentenced to 18 months of imprisonment.\u00a0 He will be deported to China after he  completes his prison sentence.\n\nBo Cai pleaded guilty on July 23, 2014,  to all three-counts of the superseding indictment charging him with violating  the Arms Export Control Act, smuggling, and conspiracy.\u00a0 Bo Cai is in federal custody and remains  detained pending his sentencing hearing.\u00a0  He faces a statutory maximum penalty of 20 years in prison on the Arms  Export Control Act charge, ten years in prison on the smuggling charge, and  five years on the conspiracy charge.\u00a0  Under the terms of his plea agreement, Bo Cai will be deported after  completing his prison sentence.\n\nThe Albuquerque office of HSI led the  investigation of this case with assistance from the U.S. Air Force Office of  Special Investigations, the Defense Security Service, HSI in Iowa and Los  Angeles, Calif., and the FBI.\u00a0 Iowa State  University cooperated throughout with HSI\u2019s investigation.\u00a0 Assistant U.S. Attorneys Dean S. Tuckman and  Fred J. Federici of the District of New Mexico are prosecuting the case with  assistance from Deputy Chief Deborah Curtis and Trial Attorneys David Recker and  Brian Fleming of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division, Counterespionage  Section, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California and  the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Iowa.",

Demers, and FBI Special Agent in Charge Diane Upchurch of the FBI Little Rock Field Office, announced today thatSimon Saw-Teong Ang, 63, of Fayetteville, Arkansas, was indicted by a federal grand jury in the Western District of Arkansas on forty-two counts of wire fraud and two counts of passport fraud.\n\n\u201cThis case is the result of the tireless efforts of our Federal law enforcement partners at the FBI and the Diplomatic Security Service, stated Acting US Attorney Fowlkes.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThe wire fraud in this case affected not only the University of Arkansas, but also several other important United States Government Agencies such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the United States Air Force. It is our sincere hope that this investigation sends a strong message to those who would attempt to defraud the Federal Government.\u201d\n\n\u201cTransparency and integrity have long sustained the pursuit of knowledge on America\u2019s campuses,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers.\u00a0 \u201cMr. Ang is alleged to have demonstrated neither when he failed to disclose his financial and other ties to companies and institutions in China to the University of Arkansas and to U.S. government agencies, despite an obligation to do so.\u00a0 This is a hallmark of the China\u2019s targeting of research and academic collaborations within the United States in order to obtain U.S. technology illegally. The Department of Justice will continue to work with colleges and universities to protect U.S. research and development from exploitation by foreign powers and will prosecute those who defraud the U.S. Government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe significant federal charges leveled against Simon Ang demonstrate how real the PRC\u2019s pervasive threat is to Arkansan innovation and businesses,\u201d said FBI Little Rock Special Agent in Charge Diane Upchurch. \u201cOur counterintelligence agents work tirelessly to protect our state\u2019s economy from foreign adversaries. Throughout this investigation, we were proud to partner with the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations, NASA\u2019s Office of Inspector General, the Diplomatic Security Service and prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office of the Western District of Arkansas.\u201d\n\nAngwas a professor and researcher at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, Arkansas since 1988.At the University of Arkansas,Angserved as the Director of the High Density Electronics Center (HiDEC) until on or about May 8, 2020. During his employment with the University of Arkansas and as director of the HiDEC,Angwas the investigator and co-investigator for many grant contracts that were funded by United States Government Agencies. Annually, the University of Arkansas requiredAngto disclose any conflicts of interest, including outside employment.\u00a0 Agents working with the FBI discovered thatAngreceived money and benefits from China and was closely associated with various companies based in China during the same time that he was receiving grants from various United States Government Agencies.\u00a0 The agents discovered thatAngdid not disclose these conflicts of interest, even when specifically required to do so by the University of Arkansas and NASA, one of the agencies that awardedAngand his research associates a Federal grant.\n\nThe Indictment charges that beginning as early as June 9, 2013, and continuing to on or about May 8, 2020, in the Western District of Arkansas, and elsewhere,Ang,knowingly and willfully devised and intended to devise a scheme and artifice to defraud and to obtain money and property from unknowing United States Government Agencies, the University of Arkansas, and others by means of material false and fraudulent pretenses, representations and promises and the concealment of material facts for the purpose of obtaining money and intellectual property that he would not have received had the University of Arkansas and other government authorities known the facts involved in his scheme and artifice to defraud.\n\nThe Indictment also chargesAngwith two counts of making false statements on a passport renewal application. Specifically, the Indictment states that on or about August 5, 2019, in the Western District of Arkansas,Ang, willfully and knowingly made a false statement in an application for a passport with intent to induce and secure for his own use the issuance of a passport contrary to the laws regulating the issuance of passports, in thatAngstated that he was not known by any names other than \u201cSimon Saw-Teong Ang,\u201d which he knew to be false. The Indictment also charges thatAngalso listed immediate travel plans for a trip to Singapore with a departure date of August 30, 2019 and a return date of September 7, 2019, which he knew also to be false.\n\nIf convicted,Angfaces a statutory maximum punishment of 20 years in prison for each wire fraud count and 10 years in federal prison for each passport fraud count. If convicted,Ang\u2019ssentence will be determined by the court after review of factors unique to this case, includingAng\u2019sprior criminal record (if any),Ang\u2019srole in the offense and the characteristics of the violations.\n\nThe FBI, the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Diplomatic Security Service (DSS), NASA Office of Inspector General and Air Force Office of Special Investigations are investigating the case. Acting United States Attorney David Clay Fowlkes from the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Arkansas and Trial Attorneys Michael Eaton and Ali Ahmad from the National Security Division are prosecuting the case.\n\nAn Indictment is merely an accusation. \u00a0An arrest warrant represents a finding of probable cause.\u00a0 A person is presumed innocent unless or until he or she is proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.",

Lenzner and Special Agent in Charge James R. Mancuso of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Baltimore.\n\nAccording to his guilty plea, between May 2009 and May 2018, Wahab sold approximately 18,306 DVDs or DVD sets, with a total retail value of $315,761.44.\u00a0 Wahab knowingly sold counterfeit DVDs containing copyrighted works belonging to ABC Studios/Disney, Anchor Bay Entertainment; Beachbody; Disney; Fox; HBO Home Entertainment; Lionsgate; MGM; Netflix; Paramount; Sony; Universal; and Warner Brothers.\n\nIn 2017, representatives from the Motion Picture Association (MPA) identified a seller on an Internet marketplace offering DVD movies for sale at a discount.\u00a0 MPA purchased an item and analyzed the DVD upon receipt.\u00a0 The packaging and labeling were substantially indistinguishable from the packaging and labeling found on legitimate copies of the movie.\u00a0 The MPA was able to determine that the movie was counterfeit. Records obtained from the Internet marketplace revealed that this seller had made over 10,000 sales of DVD or Blu-Ray discs of popular movies, television shows, or fitness programs between August 2016 and April 2018.\n\nLaw enforcement officers, operating in an undercover capacity, subsequently conducted purchases from the seller, including DVD titles of \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d \u201cGrimm,\u201d \u201cThe Little Mermaid,\u201d \u201cPeter Pan,\u201d \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs,\u201d \u201cThe Fate of the Furious,\u201d and \u201cFinding Dory,\u201d among others.\u00a0 The DVDs purchased by the undercover officers were provided to MPA representatives for authentication and were determined to be counterfeit.\u00a0 Law enforcement determined that Wahab was the individual selling the counterfeit items.\n\nA search warrant was executed at Wahab\u2019s residence and law enforcement seized two laptop computers, cellular phones, printers, and 589 counterfeit DVDs, all used by Wahab to commit copyright infringement.\u00a0 Wahab also advised law enforcement that he purchased the counterfeit DVDs that he sold from China, because the prices were much lower than normal prices.\n\nAs part of his plea agreement, Wahab will be required to forfeit the items seized from his home during the search, as well as $20,243.25 in cash seized from several bank accounts, 0.65595896 bitcoins sized from a Coinbase account, and $230.40 seized from a PayPal account used by Wahab to facilitate copyright infringement. Wahab has also agreed to pay restitution for the full amount of the victims\u2019 losses, which will be determined by the Court.\n\nWahab faces a maximum sentence of five years in federal prison for copyright infringement.\u00a0 U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis has scheduled sentencing for Wahab on May 18, 2021, at 10:00 a.m.\n\nActing United States Attorney Jonathan F. Lenzner commended HSI for its work in the investigation and thanked the MPA for its substantial assistance in this matter.\u00a0 Mr. Lenzner thanked Assistant U.S. Attorneys Rajeev R. Raghavan and Thomas M. Sullivan, who are prosecuting the case.\n\n# # #",

            "article_text": "Note:A full copy of the indictment can be viewed\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Today, a federal grand jury in Carbondale, Ill. returned an indictment charging a mathematics professor and researcher at Southern Illinois University \u2013 Carbondale (SIUC) with two counts of wire fraud and one count of making a false statement.\n\nAccording to court documents, Mingqing Xiao, 59, of Makanda, Illinois, fraudulently obtained $151,099 in federal grant money from the National Science Foundation (NSF) by concealing support he was receiving from the Chinese government and a Chinese university.\n\n\u201cAgain, an American professor stands accused of enabling the Chinese government\u2019s efforts to corruptly benefit from U.S. research funding by lying about his obligations to, and support from, an arm of the Chinese government and a Chinese public university,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers for the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division (NSD). \u201cHonesty \u00a0and transparency about funding sources lie at the heart of the scientific research enterprise.\u00a0They enable U.S. agencies to distribute scarce grants for scientific research fairly and equitably.\u00a0And they allow other researchers to evaluate potential conflicts of interest and conflicts of commitment.\u00a0 When researchers fall short of fulfilling these core academic values in ways that violate the law, the Department stand ready to investigate and prosecute.\u201d\n\n\u201cFraudulently obtaining U.S. taxpayer funding is a slap in the face to the vast majority of university researchers who do the right thing and abide by the rules,\u201d said Alan E. Kohler, Jr., Assistant Director of the FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Division. \u201cTo those individuals who choose to conceal affiliations with foreign universities or foreign governments while applying for U.S. taxpayer-funded grants, the message should be clear: the FBI and its partners are aggressively investigating allegations of grant fraud.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe FBI takes seriously its commitment to work with our partners in academia to protect U.S. research funded grants,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Sean M. Cox of the FBI\u2019s Springfield Field Office. \u201cThis investigation, like so many others, should serve as a reminder that failure to be truthful and transparent on an application for U.S. funded grants is a violation of the law. In this case the applicant allegedly failed to disclose his affiliation with China. Individuals who fail to disclose their affiliation with any foreign nation will be held accountable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe charges in this case are very serious,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Steven D. Weinhoeft for the Southern District of Illinois. \u201cUniversity grant fraud allows China to co-opt U.S. research and development at a fraction of the cost. Prosecutions like this one play an important role, not just in protecting American investments in academic research from foreign exploitation, but also in combating the growing threat that China poses to our national security. We will continue to work with our partners at NSD and the FBI on these important cases.\u201d\n\nAccording to the indictment, Xiao has worked in SIUC\u2019s mathematics department since 2000, focusing his research on partial differential equations, control theory, optimization theory, dynamical systems, and computational science. In that position, Xiao allegedly applied for and received NSF grant funds for a project set to run from 2019 to 2022 without informing NSF about another, overlapping grant he had already received from the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China. Xiao also allegedly failed to inform NSF that he was on the payroll of Shenzhen University, a public university in Guangdong Province, and that he had already committed to teaching and conducting research at Shenzhen University from 2018 to 2023.\n\nThe indictment further alleges that in March 2019, while his NSF grant proposal was still pending, Xiao submitted another grant proposal to the Natural Science Foundation of China. According to the indictment, Xiao allegedly applied for the funds as an employee of Shenzhen University and did not disclose the new Chinese proposal to NSF. Xiao is charged with falsely certifying to SIUC that his NSF grant proposal was true, complete, and accurate.\n\nBefore awarding the grant, NSF questioned Xiao about any current or pending funding from \u201cworldwide sources,\u201d including specifically whether he held any position outside of the United States or had obtained funding from non-U.S. funding sources. The indictment accuses Xiao of falsely reporting to NSF that he had nothing else to disclose.\n\nIf convicted, Xiao faces up to 20 years in prison on each count of wire fraud and up to five\u00a0years in prison for making a false statement. All three charges are also punishable by a fine of up to $250,000. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nThe investigation was conducted by the FBI, the IRS, and the Department of Homeland Security. Assistant U.S. Attorney Peter T. Reed is prosecuting the case, with assistance from NSD\u2019s Counterintelligence & Export Section.\n\nThe prosecution is part of the Justice Department\u2019s ongoing China Initiative. Led by the Department\u2019s National Security Division, the China Initiative is a broad, multi-faceted effort to counter Chinese national security threats and safeguard American intellectual property.\n\nAn indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.",

            "article_text": "Benton, Ill. \u2013 Dr. Mingqing Xiao, 60, of Makanda, Illinois, was convicted by a federal jury onWednesday, May 4, 2022, in connection with lying to federal authorities about a foreign bankaccount in China in 2017, 2018, and 2019.\n\nDr. Xiao, a mathematics professor and researcher at Southern Illinois University-Carbondale, wasconvicted \u00a0of \u00a0three \u00a0counts \u00a0of \u00a0Making \u00a0a \u00a0False \u00a0or \u00a0Fraudulent \u00a0Statement \u00a0to \u00a0the \u00a0InternalRevenue Service (IRS) on his tax returns and one count of Failure to File a report of a ForeignBank Account (FBAR). \u00a0 Evidence presented at the trial established that Xiao opened a foreign bankaccount at Ping An Bank in China in 2016 and received monthly deposits into the account fromShenzhenalo University in Shenzhen, China, from 2016 to 2020. Some of the funds were linked toadditional sources in China. By 2020, Xiao had accumulated more than $100,000 in the Chineseaccount.U.S. taxpayers are required to report the existence of any foreign bank account on their federalincome \u00a0tax \u00a0returns. \u00a0In \u00a0addition, \u00a0individuals \u00a0with \u00a0funds \u00a0in \u00a0foreign \u00a0accounts \u00a0totalingmore \u00a0than $10,000 \u00a0at \u00a0any \u00a0time \u00a0during \u00a0a \u00a0given \u00a0year \u00a0are \u00a0required \u00a0to \u00a0file \u00a0an \u00a0FBAR \u00a0with \u00a0theTreasury Department.\n\n\u201cThere \u00a0are \u00a0foreign \u00a0entities \u00a0that \u00a0exploit \u00a0American \u00a0universities \u00a0and \u00a0grant \u00a0agencies,\u201d \u00a0saidU.S. Attorney Steven D.

Further, all U.S. citizens are obligatedto disclose any foreign bank accounts they may have. The evidence established that Dr. Xiaoconcealed foreign work and hid more than $100,000 of foreign assets in an account in China, and hewas properly prosecuted and held accountable.\u201d\n\n\u201cFailing to \u00a0disclose \u00a0a foreign bank \u00a0account \u00a0and \u00a0filing false tax returns demonstrates \u00a0a lackof truthfulness and an \u00a0abdication of the duties of citizenship,\u201d said FBI Special Agent in ChargeDavid Nanz. \u00a0 \u201cXiao received money from a Chinese employer and knowingly failed to report thosefunds, thereby evading his income tax responsibilities. The FBI is committed to investigate andbring to justice anyone who avoids their obligation to live by our nation\u2019s laws.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs this verdict shows, when you fail to disclose a foreign bank account and submit false incometax statements to the IRS, you are committing tax fraud,\u201d said Darrell J.

U.S. District Court Judge F. Dennis Saylor sentenced Huang to time served and ordered her immediately removed to the People\u2019s Republic of China. \u00a0In May 2017, Huang and three other Chinese nationals were arrested and charged for their roles in a college admissions exam scam.\n\nIn 2016, Huang entered into an agreement with a co-conspirator to have the co-conspirator take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) exam under Huang\u2019s identity. On March 5, 2016, using Huang\u2019s Chinese passport and TOEFL exam registration, the co-conspirator took the TOEFL exam under Huang\u2019s identity at the TOEFL exam center in Burlington, Mass. Subsequently, the TOEFL score achieved by the co-conspirator was fraudulently awarded to Huang, which she used to gain entrance to an American university that participates in DHS\u2019s Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). The university has a minimum TOEFL score requirement that Huang had failed to achieve on previous attempts.\u00a0 Once being accepted into the SEVP, Huang was issued a student visa by the Department of State to enter and remain in the United States for the duration of her studies.\n\nUnited States Attorney Andrew E. Lelling; Michael Shea, Acting Special Agent in Charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Boston; and William B.

(GNC), has entered into a wide-ranging agreement with the Department of Justice to reform its practices related to potentially unlawful dietary ingredients and dietary supplements, and has further promised to embark on a series of voluntary initiatives designed to improve the quality and purity of dietary supplements, the Department of Justice announced today.\u00a0 The non-prosecution agreement resolves GNC\u2019s liability for selling certain dietary supplements produced by a firm currently under indictment.\u00a0 As part of the agreement, GNC has agreed to pay $2.25 million to the U.S. government and cooperate in dietary supplement investigations conducted by the government.\n\nA lengthy investigation conducted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Texas, and the Consumer Protection Branch of the Department of Justice\u2019s Civil Division revealed that GNC\u2019s practices related to ensuring the legality of products on its shelves were lacking.\n\nAccording to an agreed-upon statement of facts that accompanies the non-prosecution agreement, GNC engaged in acts and omissions that allowed a misbranded supplement\u2014 OxyElite Pro Advanced Formula, a product of Dallas-based USPlabs LLC (USP Labs)\u2014to be sold at GNC locations nationwide in 2013.\u00a0 The statement of facts notes that GNC sold the product based on representations from USP Labs that ingredients contained in the product complied with the law.\u00a0 It further notes that GNC did not undertake additional testing or require additional certifications to confirm such representations or to verify that the ingredients in the product were as represented.\n\nUSP Labs wasindictedin November 2015 and is awaiting trial.\u00a0 The indictment alleges, among other things, that USP Labs engaged in a conspiracy to import ingredients from China using false certificates of analysis and false labeling, and then lied about the source and nature of those ingredients after it put them in its products.\u00a0 According to the indictment, USP Labs told some of its retailers and wholesalers that it used natural plant extracts in some of its products, when in fact it was using synthetic stimulants manufactured in a Chinese chemical factory.\n\nToday\u2019s resolution requires GNC to commit to certain changes designed to prevent unlawful dietary supplements from reaching its shelves:\n\n\n\n\u201cUnlawful dietary supplements are an important enforcement priority for the department,\u201d said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Benjamin C. Mizer, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division. \u201cToday\u2019s resolution is a significant step forward in reforming an industry rife with alarming practices. Companies like GNC need to do more to ensure that they are not selling products containing questionable and untested ingredients.\u00a0 The American public deserves better, and the Department of Justice appreciates GNC\u2019s efforts in resolving its issues and moving forward in the best interests of American consumers.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am pleased with this agreement and hold steadfast that those engaged in the sale of dietary supplements to the public must adhere to higher standards to ensure consumers are protected from lax business practices that could endanger them,\u201d said U.S. Attorney John R. Parker of the Northern District of Texas.\n\n\u201cProtecting the public from unsafe ingredients in dietary supplements is one of FDA\u2019s most important responsibilities,\u201d said Director George M. Karavetsos of FDA Office of Criminal Investigations. \u201cWe will continue to work with industry to ensure that supplements distributed in the U.S. marketplace do not contain harmful ingredients.\u201d\n\nThe matter was handled by Consumer Protection Branch Trial Attorneys David Sullivan and Patrick Runkle, and Northern District of Texas Assistant U.S. Attorney Errin Martin.\u00a0 FDA Office of Chief Counsel Attorneys Nathan Sabel and Michael Shane supported the matter, which was investigated by the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, Dallas Domicile.\n\nToday\u2019s action is part of the government\u2019s efforts, in collaboration with the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences\u2019 Consortium for Health and Military Performance (CHAMP), to provide educational resources for service members and the general public to protect them from risky dietary supplements.\u00a0Through its Operation Supplement Safety (OPSS), and in partnership with the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) and Supplement 411, OPSS provides important information to service members and consumers about dietary supplements.\u00a0 In 2015, OPSS launched a High-Risk Supplement List mobile application (accessible on iOS and Android).

Fishman for the District of New Jersey announced.\n\nThe defendants (see chart below) were arrested\u00a0in New Jersey and Washingtonby special agents with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and charged in 14 complaints with conspiracy to commit visa fraud, conspiracy to harbor aliens for profit and other offenses. \u00a0All the defendants, with the exception of Yanjun Lin aka Aimee Lin, 25, of Flushing, New York, will appear today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Steven C.

Strombom in the Western District of Washington federal court.\n\n\u201c\u2018Pay to Stay\u2019 schemes not only damage our perception of legitimate student and foreign worker visa programs, they also pose a very real threat to national security,\u201d U.S. Attorney Fishman said. \u00a0\u201cToday\u2019s arrests, which were made possible by the great undercover work of our law enforcement partners, stopped 21 brokers, recruiters and employers across multiple states who recklessly exploited our immigration system for financial gain.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile the United States fully supports international education, we will vigorously investigate those who seek to exploit the U.S. immigration system,\u201d said Director Sarah R. Salda\u00f1a for ICE. \u00a0\u201cAs a result of this operation, HSI special agents have successfully identified and closed a gap in the student visa system and have arrested 21 individuals alleged to be amongst the system\u2019s most egregious violators.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndividuals engaged in schemes that would undermine the remarkable educational opportunities afforded to international students represent an affront to those who play by the rules,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Terence S. Opiola for ICE Homeland Security Investigations.\u00a0 \u201cThese unscrupulous individuals undermine the integrity of the immigration system.\u00a0 Our special agents are committed to addressing, identifying fraud in order to better protect the system as a whole.\u201d\n\nAccording to the complaints unsealed today and statements made in court:\n\nThe defendants, many of whom operated recruiting companies for purported international students, were arrested for their involvement in an alleged scheme to enroll foreign nationals as students in the University of Northern New Jersey, a purported for-profit college located in Cranford, New Jersey (UNNJ). \u00a0Unbeknownst to the defendants and the foreign nationals they conspired with, however, the UNNJ was created in September 2013 by HSI federal agents.\n\nThrough the UNNJ, undercover HSI agents investigated criminal activities associated with the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), including, but not limited to, student visa fraud and the harboring of aliens for profit.\u00a0 The UNNJ was not staffed with instructors or educators, had no curriculum and conducted no actual classes or education activities. \u00a0The UNNJ operated solely as a storefront location with small offices staffed by federal agents posing as school administrators.\n\nUNNJ represented itself as a school that, among other things, was authorized to issue a document known as a \u201cCertificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant (F-1) Student Status - for Academic and Language Students,\u201d commonly referred to as a Form I-20.\u00a0 This document, which certifies that a foreign national has been accepted to a school and would be a full-time student, typically enables legitimate foreign students to obtain an F-1 student visa.\u00a0 The F-1 student visa allows a foreign student to enter and/or remain in the United States while the student makes normal progress toward the completion of a full course of study in an SEVP accredited institution.\n\nDuring the investigation, HSI special agents identified hundreds of foreign nationals, primarily from China and India, who previously entered the U.S. on F-1 non-immigrant student visas to attend other SEVP- accredited schools.\u00a0 Through various recruiting companies and business entities located in New Jersey, California, Illinois, New York and Virginia, the defendants then enabled approximately 1,076 of these foreign individuals \u2013 all of whom were willing participants in the scheme \u2013 to fraudulently maintain their nonimmigrant status in the U.S. on the false pretense that they continued to participate in full courses of study at the UNNJ.\n\nActing as recruiters, the defendants solicited the involvement of UNNJ administrators to participate in the scheme. \u00a0During the course of their dealings with undercover agents, the defendants fully acknowledged that none of their foreign national clients would attend any actual courses, earn actual credits, or make academic progress toward an actual degree in a particular field of study.\u00a0 Rather, the defendants facilitated the enrollment of their foreign national clients in UNNJ to fraudulently maintain student visa status, in exchange for kickbacks, or \u201ccommissions.\u201d\u00a0 The defendants also facilitated the creation of hundreds of false student records, including transcripts, attendance records and diplomas, which were purchased by their foreign national conspirators for the purpose of deceiving immigration authorities.\n\nIn other instances, the defendants used UNNJ to fraudulently obtain work authorization and work visas for hundreds of their clients.\u00a0 By obtaining this authorization, a number of defendants were able to outsource their foreign national clients as full-time employees with numerous U.S.-based corporations, also in exchange for commission fees.\u00a0 Other defendants devised phony IT projects that were\u00a0purportedly to occur at the school.\u00a0 These defendants then created and caused to be created false contracts, employment verification letters, transcripts and other documents.\u00a0 The defendants then paid the undercover agents thousands of dollars to put the school\u2019s letterhead on the sham documents, to sign the documents as school administrators and to otherwise go along with the scheme.\n\nAll of these bogus documents created the illusion that prospective foreign workers would be working at the school in some IT capacity or project.\u00a0 The defendants then used these fictitious documents fraudulently to obtain labor certifications issued by the U.S. Secretary of Labor and then ultimately to petition the U.S. government to obtain H1-B visas for non-immigrants.\u00a0 These fictitious documents were then submitted to the U.S. Customs and Immigration Services (USCIS).\u00a0 In the vast majority of circumstances, the foreign worker visas were not issued because USCIS was advised of the ongoing undercover operation.\n\nIn addition, starting today, HSI Newark is coordinating with the ICE Counterterrorism and Criminal Exploitation Unit (CTCEU) and the SEVP to terminate the nonimmigrant student status for the foreign nationals associated with UNNJ, and if applicable, administratively arrest and place them into removal proceedings.\n\nThe chart below outlines the charges for each defendant. \u00a0The charges of conspiracy to commit visa fraud and making a false statement each carry a maximum potential penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. \u00a0The charges of conspiracy to harbor aliens for profit and H1-B Visa fraud each carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and $250,000 fine.\n\nThe charges and allegations contained in the complaints are merely accusations and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\n\nU.S. Attorney Fishman credited special agents of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, under the leadership of Director Salda\u00f1a; HSI Newark, under the leadership of Special Agent in Charge Opiola; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Counterterrorism and Criminal Exploitation Unit, under the leadership of Unit Chief Robert Soria;\u00a0 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Fraud Detection and National Security Section, under the leadership of Associate Director Matthew Emrich; the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, under the leadership of Deputy Assistant Director Louis M.

Brouillette; U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Office of Fraud Prevention Programs, under the leadership of Director Josh Glazeroff; and the FBI, Joint Terrorism Task Force, under the leadership of Timothy Gallagher in Newark, for their contributions to the investigation.\n\nHe also thanked the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges (ACCSC), under the leadership of Executive Director Michale S. McComis, and the New Jersey Office of Higher Education, under the leadership of Secretary of Higher Education Rochelle R.

Fishman said today.\n\nKyle Jobes, 23, of East Brunswick, N.J., and Charles Knierim, 24, of Old Bridge, N.J., were arrested on March 14, 2013; Benjamin Caturano, 22, of New Brunswick, N.J., and Conor Healion, 22, of West Hempstead, N.Y. were arrested on March 15, 2013. All are charged in connection with their respective roles in a conspiracy to distribute Methylenedioxypryovalerone (\u201cMDPV\u201d) in New Jersey and New York. \u201cBath salts\u201d is the street name for a family of designer drugs that have effects similar to amphetamine and cocaine. Their white and yellow crystals often resemble legal bath salts, like Epsom salts, but are chemically different.\n\nThe current investigation involved a package containing approximately two kilograms of MDPV that was intercepted by law enforcement. The package originated in the People\u2019s Republic of China and was supposed to be shipped to an address in Old Bridge. Law enforcement removed the MDPV and replaced it was sham drugs that resembled bath salts.\u00a0 On March 14, 2013, law enforcement delivered the package to where it was addressed and watched over the next two days as Knierim, Jobes, Caturano, and Healion transferred the package amongst themselves. After their arrests, a number of the defendants admitted that they had distributed multiple kilograms of bath salts over the past year and that some of the drugs were sold at local college campuses, including Rutgers University and Monmouth University. As part of the investigation, agents of Immigration and Customs Enforcement-Homeland Security Investigations seized more than $90,000 in cash and two luxury automobiles obtained with proceeds from the drug conspiracy.\n\nKnierim made his initial appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael A. Hammer in Newark federal court on March 15, 2013. Jobes, Caturano and Healion made their initial appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge Falk in Newark federal court today.\n\nU.S. Attorney Fishman credited special agents of the ICE-HSI, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Andrew McLees, with the investigation leading to the arrests, assisted by inspectors of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, under the direction of Acting Inspector in Charge Maria Kelokates, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, under the direction of Robert E.

(collectively University Furnishings) agreed to pay $15 million to resolve a lawsuit brought under the False Claims Act alleging that the companies made or conspired with others to make false statements to avoid paying duties on wooden bedroom furniture imported from the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u00a0 Texas-based University Furnishings sells furniture for student housing.\n\n\u201cThose who introduce goods into the United States must comply with the law, including the payment of customs duties meant to protect domestic companies and American workers from unfair competition abroad,\u201d said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Benjamin C. Mizer, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division.\u00a0 \u201cThe Department of Justice will zealously pursue those who seek an unfair advantage in U.S. markets by evading the duties owed on goods imported into this country.\u201d\n\nThe government alleged that between 2009 and mid-2012, University Furnishings knowingly misclassified or conspired with others to misclassify wooden bedroom furniture on documents presented to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to avoid paying antidumping duties on imports of wooden bedroom furniture manufactured in the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u00a0 Specifically, University Furnishings allegedly classified the furniture as office and other types of furniture not subject to duties while selling the furniture in the student housing market for use in dormitory bedrooms.\u00a0 The Department of Commerce assesses and CBP collects antidumping duties to protect U.S. businesses by offsetting unfair foreign pricing and foreign government subsidies.\n\n\u201cCompanies that cheat, by fraudulently mislabeling their imports, undermine U.S. manufacturers and others that obey the rules, and hurt consumers and taxpayers,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Richard L.

Garcia in New Haven, and Denis Nako and Klevis Nako appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert A. Richardson in Hartford. All three were released on $50,000 bonds.\n\nAs alleged in court documents, Kimca, Denis Nako, and Klevis Nako operated various websites, Instagram pages, and Facebook pages through which they advertised and sold counterfeit luxury watches that they had imported from China.\u00a0 During the investigation, law enforcement made multiple undercover transactions in which they purchased counterfeit Rolex watches from several of the Instagram accounts for approximately $200 to $300 per watch.\u00a0 The proceeds of the sales were deposited into bank accounts belonging to Kimca, Denis Nako, and Klevis Nako.\n\nIt is further alleged that, between April 2020 to July 2022, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) seized approximately 74 parcels addressed to Kimca, or his aliases, that contained counterfeit luxury watches, including counterfeit Rolex, Audemars, and Panerai watches, having a total estimated manufacturers\u2019 suggested retail price of more than $16 million had the watches been authentic.\u00a0 In addition, between February 2021 to April 2022, CBP seized approximately 22 parcels addressed to the residence of Denis and Klevis Nako that contained counterfeit luxury watches, including counterfeit Rolex and Cartier watches, having a total estimated manufacturers\u2019 suggested retail price of more than $3 million had the watches been authentic.\n\nAccording to court documents, Klevis Nako is employed as a police officer with the Framingham State University Police Department in Framingham, Massachusetts.\n\nIt is alleged that, in January 2023, HSI agents interviewed Kimca about trafficking counterfeit watches and told him that selling counterfeit watches was illegal.\u00a0 Kimca also had received several notices from CBP that watches had been seized and detailing potential violations associated with the importation of the items.\u00a0 Kimca continued to sell counterfeit watches after the interview and after receiving the CBP notices.\n\nThe complaints charge Kimca, Denis Nako, and Klevis Nako with trafficking in and conspiring to traffic in counterfeit goods and services, offenses that carry a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years.\u00a0 Kimca is also charged with engaging in illegal monetary transactions, an offense that carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years.\n\nU.S. Attorney Avery stressed that a complaint is only a charge and is not evidence of guilt.\u00a0 Charges are only allegations, and a defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThis matter is being investigated by Homeland Security Investigations (HSI); the Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation Division; and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.\u00a0 U.S. Customs and Border Protection has assisted the investigation.\u00a0 The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Neeraj N.

            "article_text": "FRESNO, Calif. \u2014 The operator of a Reedley lab, who was indicted in November 2023, faces additional charges of conspiracy and wire fraud after a federal grand jury returned a 12-count superseding indictment today, U.S. Attorney Phillip A. Talbert announced.\n\nJia Bei Zhu, 62, a citizen of China, was previously indicted for distributing adulterated and misbranded COVID-19 test kits in violation of the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and making false statements to authorities about his identity and involvement with the biolabs. The superseding indictment also charges Zhu\u2019s romantic and business partner, Zhaoyan Wang, 38, a citizen of China, who operated the biolabs Universal Meditech Inc. (UMI) and Prestige Biotech Inc. (PBI) in Fresno and Reedley along with Zhu. UMI and PBI distributed COVID-19, pregnancy, and other types of test kits.\n\nAccording to court documents, from August 2020 through March 2023, Zhu and Wang conspired to defraud buyers of UMI and PBI\u2019s COVID-19 test kits. They imported hundreds of thousands of COVID-19 test kits from Ai De Ltd., which was a company in China that they controlled, and falsely represented to the buyers that the test kits were made in the United States. They illegally imported the COVID-19 test kits, which they were not approved to import, by falsely declaring them as pregnancy test kits, which they were approved to import.\n\nZhu and Wang also falsely represented to the buyers that UMI and PBI could make up to 100,000 COVID-19 test kits per week in the United States and that the test kits were made in connection with other labs that were certified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Finally, they falsely represented to the buyers that the test kits were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Zhu and Wang made over $1.7\u00a0million through their fraud.\n\nWhen buyers requested to inspect UMI and PBI\u2019s facilities in Fresno and Reedley, Zhu and Wang denied them access and fabricated reasons for the denial. The fabricated reasons included that the facilities were undergoing construction and renovation, and that proprietary and confidential information and technology was inside. In reality, however, they did not want the buyers to know that UMI and PBI were obtaining the COVID-19 test kits from China.\n\nZhu is currently detained in custody pending his federal trial. His next status conference is scheduled for Sept. 11, 2024. Wang is not in custody.\n\nThis case is the product of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Arelis Clemente, Joseph Barton, and Henry Carbajal III are prosecuting the case.\n\nIf convicted, Zhu and Wang each face maximum statutory penalties of 20 years in prison for the conspiracy and wire fraud charges, and an additional three years in prison for the distribution of adulterated and misbranded medical device charges. Zhu also faces another five years in prison for the false statements charge. Any sentences, however, would be determined at the discretion of the court after consideration of any applicable statutory factors and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which take into account a number of variables. The charges are only allegations. Zhu and Wang are presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.",

            "article_text": "\n\nNEWARK, N.J. \u2013 A former New Jersey-based defense contractor  employee \u2013 who was convicted by a federal jury for exporting sensitive U.S.  military technology to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), stealing trade  secrets and lying to federal agents \u2013 was sentenced today to 70 months in  prison, New Jersey U.S. Attorney Paul J. Fishman announced.\n\nSixing Liu,  a/k/a, \u201cSteve Liu,\u201d 49, a PRC citizen who had recently lived in Flanders, N.J.,  and Deerfield, Ill., has been in custody since the September 2012 verdict,  based on his risk of flight.\n\n\u201cInstead of  the accolades he sought from China, Sixing Liu today received the appropriate  reward for his threat to our national security: 70 months in prison,\u201d said U.S.  Attorney Fishman. \u201cAs an innovation leader, the United States is a target for  those seeking to cut corners at the expense of American businesses and  consumers. As this sentence shows, the Department of Justice is making great  progress in the fight against trade secret theft in order to protect the  engines of our nation\u2019s economic recovery.\u201d\n\nThe jury convicted Liu of  nine of the 11 counts in the Second Superseding Indictment with which he was  charged, including six counts of violating the Arms Export Control Act and the  International Traffic in Arms Regulations, one count of possessing stolen trade  secrets in violation of the Economic Espionage Act of 1996, one count of  transporting stolen property in interstate commerce and one count of lying to  federal agents.\n\nIn addition  to the prison term, Liu was sentenced to serve three years of supervised  release and ordered to pay a $15,000 fine.\u00a0  Restitution is to be determined at a later date.\n\nAccording  to documents filed in the case and evidence presented at trial:\n\nIn 2010,  Liu stole thousands of electronic files from his employer, L-3 Communications,  Space and Navigation Division, located in Budd Lake, N.J. The stolen files  detailed the performance and design of guidance systems for missiles, rockets,  target locators and unmanned aerial vehicles. Liu stole the files to position  and prepare himself for future employment in the PRC. As part of that plan, Liu  delivered presentations about the technology at several PRC universities, the  Chinese Academy of Sciences and conferences organized by PRC government  entities.\n\nOn Nov. 12,  2010, Liu boarded a flight from Newark Liberty International Airport to the  PRC. Upon his return to the United States on Nov. 29, 2010, agents found Liu in  possession of a non-work-issued computer containing the stolen material. The  following day, Liu lied to agents of the Department of Homeland Security about  the extent of his work on U.S. defense technology, which the jury found to be a  criminal false statement.The U.S.  Department of State\u2019s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls later verified that  several of the stolen files on Liu\u2019s computer contained export-controlled  technical data that relates to defense items listed on the United States  Munitions List (USML). Under federal regulations, items and data covered by the  USML may not be exported without a license, which Liu did not obtain. The regulations  also provide that it is the policy of the United States to deny licenses to  export items and data covered by the USML to countries with which the United  States maintains an arms embargo, including the PRC.\n\nThe jury  heard testimony that Liu\u2019s company trained him about the United States\u2019 export  control laws and told him that most of the company\u2019s products were covered by  those laws.U.S.  Attorney Fishman credited special agents of the FBI, under the direction of Acting  Special Agent in Charge David Velazquez; special agents of ICE-Homeland Security  Investigations, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Andrew McLees;  and officers of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, under the leadership of  Director of New York Field Operations Robert E. Perez, for the investigation  leading to the sentence.The  government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney L. Judson Welle of the U.S.  Attorney\u2019s Office National Security Unit and Assistant U.S. Attorney Gurbir S.  Grewal of the Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property Section of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s  Office Economic Crimes Unit, both in Newark. The prosecution received valuable  support from attorneys of the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s National Security  Division, Counterespionage Section.13-141\n\nDefense counsel: James  Darryl Tunick Esq., Chicago",

            "article_text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Kexue Huang, a Chinese national and a former resident of Carmel, Ind., was sentenced today to 87 months in prison and three years of supervised release on charges of economic espionage to benefit components of the Chinese government and theft of trade secrets.\n\n\n\nThe sentencing was announced by Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division, Assistant Attorney General for National Security Lisa O. Monaco, U.S. Attorney Joseph H. Hogsett of the Southern District of Indiana, U.S. Attorney B. Todd Jones of the District of Minnesota, and Robert J. Holley, Special Agent in Charge of the Indianapolis Field Office of the FBI.\n\n\n\nThis is the first prosecution in Indiana for foreign economic espionage.\u00a0 Since its enactment in 1996, there have been a total of eight cases charged nationwide under the Economic Espionage Act.\n\n\n\n\u201cMr. Huang stole valuable trade secrets from two American companies and disseminated them to individuals in Germany and China,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Breuer.  \u201cEconomic espionage and trade secret theft are serious crimes that, as today\u2019s sentence shows, must be punished severely.  Protecting trade secrets is vital to our nation\u2019s economic success, and we will continue vigorously to enforce our trade secret and economic espionage statutes.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe theft of American trade secrets for the benefit of China and other nations poses a continuing threat to our economic and national security,\u201d said  Lisa Monaco,  Assistant Attorney General for National Security.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cToday\u2019s sentence demonstrates our commitment to detect, prosecute and hold accountable those engaged in these illegal activities.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States Attorney\u2019s Office takes seriously its obligation to protect Hoosier businesses from economic espionage,\u201d U.S. Attorney Hogsett said. \u201cI thank the federal agents and prosecutors who helped bring this landmark case to a successful conclusion.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Kexue Huang investigation and prosecution is an excellent example of how law enforcement and American corporations can work together to protect our corporations from economic espionage and the theft of extremely valuable trade secrets,\u201d FBI Special Agent in Charge Holley stated.  \u201cDow Agrosciences and the FBI cooperated extensively to make this important investigation a success. Economic espionage is a crime that undermines the competiveness of our corporations and our national interest in protecting intellectual property. The FBI will continue to work collaboratively with the private sector to aggressively investigate those individuals that seek to harm our country\u2019s economic interests by stealing our intellectual property and thereby undermining our competitive economic position in the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nHuang, 46, was sentenced by the U.S. District Judge William T. Lawrence in the Southern District of Indiana.\u00a0 On Oct. 18, 2011, Huang pleaded guilty to one count of an indictment filed in the Southern District of Indiana for misappropriating and transporting trade secrets from Dow AgroSciences LLC with the intent to benefit components of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).\u00a0 Huang also pleaded guilty to one count of an indictment filed in the District of Minnesota for stealing a trade secret from a second company, Cargill Inc.\n\n\n\nAccording to court documents, from January 2003 until February 2008, Huang was employed as a research scientist at Dow, a leading international agricultural company based in Indianapolis that provides agrochemical and biotechnology products.\u00a0 In 2005, Huang became a research leader for Dow in strain development related to unique, proprietary organic insecticides marketed worldwide.\n\n\n\nAs a Dow employee, Huang signed an agreement that outlined his obligations in handling confidential information, including trade secrets.  The agreement prohibited him from disclosing any confidential information without Dow\u2019s consent.   Dow employed several layers of security to preserve and maintain confidentiality and to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of its trade secrets.\n\n\n\nHuang admitted that during his employment at Dow, he misappropriated several Dow trade secrets.\u00a0 According to plea documents, from 2007 to 2010, Huang transferred and delivered the stolen Dow trade secrets to individuals in Germany and the PRC.\u00a0 With the assistance of these individuals, Huang used the stolen materials to conduct unauthorized research with the intent to benefit foreign universities that were tied to the PRC government.\u00a0 Huang also admitted that he pursued steps to develop and produce the misappropriated Dow trade secrets in the PRC, including identifying manufacturing facilities in the PRC that would allow him to compete directly with Dow in the established organic pesticide market.\n\n\n\nAccording to court documents, after Huang left Dow, he was hired in March 2008 by Cargill, an international producer and marketer of food, agricultural, financial and industrial products and services.\u00a0 Huang worked as a biotechnologist for Cargill until July 2009 and signed a confidentiality agreement promising never to disclose any trade secrets or other confidential information of Cargill.\u00a0 Huang admitted that during his employment with Cargill, he stole one of the company\u2019s trade secrets \u2013 a key component in the manufacture of a new food product, which he later disseminated to another person, specifically a student at Hunan Normal University in the PRC.\n\n\n\nIn the plea agreement, Huang admitted that the aggregated loss from the misappropriated trade secrets exceeds $7 million but is less than $20 million.\n\n\n\nThe case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Cynthia J. Ridgeway of the Southern District of Indiana, Trial Attorneys Mark L. Krotoski and Evan C. Williams of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS), and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Paulsen of the District of Minnesota, with assistance from the National Security Division\u2019s Counterespionage Section.  Significant assistance was provided by the CCIPS Cyber Crime Lab and the Office of International Affairs in the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division.\n\n\n\nThe sentence announced today is an example of the type of efforts being undertaken by the Department of Justice Task Force on Intellectual Property (IP Task Force).  Attorney General Eric Holder created the IP Task Force to combat the growing number of domestic and international intellectual property crimes, protect the health and safety of American consumers, and safeguard the nation\u2019s economic security against those who seek to profit illegally from American creativity, innovation and hard work.  The IP Task Force seeks to strengthen intellectual property rights protection through heightened criminal and civil enforcement, greater coordination among federal, state and local law enforcement partners, and increased focus on international enforcement efforts, including reinforcing relationships with key foreign partners and U.S. industry leaders.

            "article_text": "ATLANTA - John Crittenden, a professor of environmental engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology and the former director of the Brook Byers Institute for Sustainable Systems, has pleaded guilty to tax fraud for lying on his tax returns by overstating his charitable deductions.\n\n\u201cCharitable giving is a virtue. But Crittenden avoided paying hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes by lying about his charitable deductions to perpetrate a tax fraud scheme involving Chinese nationals,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Buchanan. \u201cBecause of his actions Crittenden will no longer be employed by the university and will also be required to pay all taxes owed.\u201d\n\n\u201cCrittenden\u2019s guilty plea is the result of the determination and hard work of federal investigators and prosecutors who aggressively pursue allegations of tax fraud,\u201d said Keri Farley, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta. \u201cThe FBI is determined to root out and prosecute anyone who would try to undermine the tax return system.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo matter the scheme or amount, do not falsify your tax returns,\u201d said IRS Criminal Investigation Acting Special Agent in Charge Demetrius Hardeman.\u00a0 \u201cWe have an incredible team of talented, intelligent agents trained to investigate these tax fraud schemes.\u00a0 Crittenden not only has to make amends by paying his owed taxes, but he also faces jail time, fines, and penalties for his decisions.\u00a0 This guilty plea is evidence that fraud does not pay.\u201d\n\nAccording to U.S. Attorney Buchanan, the charges and other information presented in court: John Crittenden\u2019s academic research focused on scalable water treatment systems and technologies. Crittenden had deep ties to China, in part due to his position at Georgia Tech and his research.\n\nWhile employed at Georgia Tech and living in the United States, Crittenden partnered with a Chinese national, Duo Li, to operate several companies in China, including Beijing Keruiduo Environmental, Beijing Crittenden Environmental Technology Company, and Kunshan Techfirst. These companies, as well as individuals associated with Duo Li, wired hundreds of thousands of dollars either directly to the charitable donation arm of Georgia Tech, the Georgia Institute of Technology Foundation (GTF), or to Crittenden\u2019s Bank of America account, after which he \u201cdonated\u201d the funds to GTF. When the funds arrived at GTF, they were earmarked for Crittenden\u2019s use at Georgia Tech. Regardless of how the funds reached GTF, Crittenden improperly and falsely claimed the transfers to GTF as charitable deductions on his tax returns without recognizing any of the transfers as income.\n\nCrittenden also received transfers to his Bank of America account from Chinese nationals who were participating in post-doctoral research at Georgia Tech or their family members. Crittenden then \u201cdonated\u201d these funds to GTF and improperly and falsely took a charitable deduction on his tax returns, while not recognizing any of the funds as income. Neither Georgia Tech nor GTF were aware that Crittenden was conducting this tax fraud scheme.\n\nAs part of the plea agreement, prior to sentencing, Crittenden must resign from all positions of employment at the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Georgia Tech Research Institute, pay all taxes owed for tax years 2011 through 2021, and fully cooperate with the Examination Division of the Internal Revenue Service in making a complete and accurate determination of all taxes, penalties, and interest that Crittenden owes.\n\nSentencing for Crittenden, 73, of Atlanta, Georgia, is scheduled for January 16, 2024, at 10:00 am before U.S. District Judge Leigh Martin May. Crittenden pleaded guilty to a criminal information charging him with making a false statement on a tax return, in violation of Title 26, United States Code, Section 7206(1).\n\nThis case is being investigated by the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation and Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Samir Kaushal is prosecuting the case.\n\nFor further information please contact the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Public Affairs Office atUSAGAN.PressEmails@usdoj.govor (404) 581-6016.\u00a0 The Internet address for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Georgia ishttp://www.justice.gov/usao-ndga.",

            "article_text": "Acting United States Attorney Jan W. Sharp announced that Zhijun Xia, age 30, of China, was sentenced today to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment by United States District Court Judge John M. Gerrard for Coercion and Enticement of a Minor. There is no parole in the federal system. After his release, Xia will be on supervised release for 5 years and be required to register as a sex offender. Additionally, Xia was ordered to pay $3,000 in restitution. Xia will be deported back to China after serving his sentence.\n\nJudge Gerrard noted in pronouncing this sentence and recognizing the trauma the victim suffered that \u201cIt\u2019s the Court\u2019s hope the victim knows these incidents should not shape her life.\u201d\n\nBetween June 1, 2018 to February 28, 2020, Xia was a graduate student at the University of Nebraska Omaha. Xia is a Chinese national. Xia met the victim\u2019s mother who hired Xia to tutor the victim in the Chinese language. Xia began tutoring the victim in June of 2018. Xia met the victim in person for the tutoring sessions and began communicating with the victim over the social media application WeChat. Xia began inquiring over WeChat about the victim\u2019s sexual history.\n\nOn July 10, 2018, the victim attended a summer camp at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, Nebraska. Xia messaged the victim over the Internet using WeChat about his plan to visit her in Lincoln on July 11. During this conversation, Xia discussed various forms of birth control with the victim in response to the victim relaying her fears of becoming pregnant while in high school. Xia reserved a room at the Red Roof Inn and Suites in Lincoln for the night of July 11. Xia picked up the victim from the University of Nebraska campus and took the victim to the Red Roof Inn, where he subjected the victim to sexual penetration. Xia was 27 years of age and the victim was 15 years of age. It is a crime under Nebraska State law for someone over the age of 25 to subject someone between the ages of 12 and 16 to sexual penetration. Immediately following this incident, Xia continued to message the victim on WeChat regarding the July 11 incident.\n\nXia has also pled guilty to one count of First Degree Sexual Assault in the District Court of Douglas County, Nebraska for events occurring with the same victim in Omaha. He is scheduled to be sentenced on that case on August 25, 2021.\n\nFBI Omaha Special Agent in Charge Eugene Kowel said, \u201cThe family of Zhijun Xia\u2019s victim trusted him as an academic and tutor.\u00a0 He used that trust to prey on a teenage girl.\u00a0 His sentence today serves as an example of FBI Omaha\u2019s unwavering commitment to work with our law enforcement partners to investigate and prosecute anyone who victimizes children.\u201d\n\nThis case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice.

            "article_text": "A federal judge in Amarillo yesterday sentenced Dr. Richard Kazmaier, 55, to six months in prison, three years of post-release supervision, and a $5,000 fine. Kazmaier pleaded guilty on Aug. 19, 2022, to a Lacey Act felony for importing protected wildlife into the United States without declaring it or obtaining the required permits.\n\nAccording to court documents, Kazmaier was an associate professor of biology at West Texas A&M University before resigning in October 2022. A federal grand jury issued an indictment in January 2022 charging Kazmaier with smuggling goods into the United States and two violations of the Endangered Species Act. Kazmaier pleaded guilty to a superseding information charging the Lacey Act, the nation\u2019s oldest wildlife trafficking statute. The court dismissed the indictment at the government\u2019s request.\n\nThe Lacey Act and federal regulations require importers to declare wildlife to customs and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service when it enters the country. Between March 2013 and February 2020, Kazmaier admitted he imported wildlife items from Bulgaria, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Indonesia, Latvia, Norway, Russia, South Africa, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Uruguay into Texas without declaring them. Kazmaier admitted he purchased and imported approximately 358 wildlife items with a total market value of $14,423 from eBay and other online sales websites. He did not import any live animals and instead purchased mostly skulls, skeletons, and taxidermy mounts.\n\nThe Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) regulates trade in endangered or threatened species through permit requirements. The United States and 183 other countries are signatories to the CITES treaty. Kazmaier acknowledged importing 14 protected species without obtaining permits, including the Eurasian otter, lynx, caracal, vervet monkey, greater naked-tailed armadillo, and king bird-of-paradise.\n\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s Office of Law Enforcement in Redmond, Washington, conducted the investigation as part of Operation Global Reach. The operation focused on the trafficking of wildlife from Indonesia to the United States.\n\nThe government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney Anna Marie Bell for the Northern District of Texas and Senior Trial Attorney Ryan Connors of the Department of Justice\u2019s Environmental Crimes Section.",

The Arms Export Control Act prohibits the export of defense-related materials, including the technical data, to a foreign national or a foreign nation.\n\nAfter a trial in September 2008, Dr. Roth was convicted of conspiring with Atmospheric Glow Technology, Inc., a Knoxville technology company, of unlawfully exporting in 2005 and 2006 fifteen different \"defense articles\" to a citizen of the People\u2019s Republic of China in violation of the Arms Export Control Act. This law prohibits the export of defense-related materials, including the technical data, to a foreign national or a foreign nation. These defense articles related to different specific military technical data that had been restricted and was associated with the USAF project to develop plasma technology for use on weapons system drones.\n\nDr. Roth was also convicted of one count of wire fraud relating to defrauding the University of Tennessee of his honest services by illegally exporting sensitive military information relating to this USAF research and development contract.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) led the investigation and was joined in its efforts by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations, and the Department of Commerce\u2019s Office of Export Enforcement. The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jeffrey Theodore and Will Mackie of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Tennessee.\n\nU.S. Attorney Dedrick commended the efforts of the special agents from the agencies supporting the investigation. He noted that this case was quickly brought to trial and sentencing through the excellent work of the Department of Justice\u2019s National Security Division and the Assistant U.S. Attorneys and support staff from his office. Dedrick added, \"This case should send a stern warning to those who would betray the trust of our nation by violating the export control laws by providing our military information to foreign nationals.\"\n\nDavid Kris, Assistant Attorney General for National Security, stated, \"I applaud the agents and prosecutors who worked tirelessly to bring about this result. The illegal export of restricted military data represents a serious threat to national security. We know that foreign governments are actively seeking this information for their own military development. Today\u2019s sentence should serve as a warning to anyone who knowingly discloses restricted military data in violation of our laws.\"\n\nFBI Special Agent in Charge Richard Lambert added: \"Safeguarding sensitive military technology vital to our nation\u2019s defense remains a top priority of the FBI. We are grateful to the University of Tennessee for its invaluable partnership in this important investigation.\"",

Chen will make an initial appearance today before Magistrate Judge Donald L. Cabell.\n\nAccording to charging documents, Chen is a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in China. He is a professor and researcher at MIT where he serves as Director of the MIT Pappalardo Micro/Nano Engineering Laboratory and Director of the Solid-State Solar Thermal Energy Conversion Center (S3TEC). Since approximately 2013, Chen\u2019s research at MIT has been funded by more than $19 million in grants awarded by various U.S. federal agencies.\n\nSince 2012, Chen has allegedly held various appointments with the PRC designed to promote the PRC\u2019s technological and scientific development by providing advice and expertise \u2013 sometimes directly to PRC government officials \u2013 and often in exchange for financial compensation. This includes acting as an \u201coverseas expert\u201d for the PRC government at the request of the PRC Consulate Office in New York and serving as a member of at least two PRC Talent Programs. Since 2013, Chen allegedly received approximately $29 million of foreign funding, including $19 million from the PRC\u2019s Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech).\n\nIt is further alleged that Chen\u2019s efforts to promote the PRC\u2019s scientific and economic development were partially detailed in a February 2016 email that Chen sent himself using his MIT e-mail account.\u00a0 The email read:\n\n1. promote chinese collaboration\n\n2. China places innovation (scientific) as key and core not fashion [sic], but because\n\nwe must do it, from historic trend as well from our stage\n\n3. our economy is no. 2, but from technology (structure of economy) and human\n\nresources, we are far from no. 2\n\n4. we are paying big price in environment, not sustainable, as well as from labor cost\n\n5. environment protection and development in same place, environment even higher, clean energy if higher cost, reduce steel, cement. We must count on technology, cannot grow as past\n\n6. communist 18th convention, scientific innovation placed at core. We realize not just independent innovation; but also internationalize to plan for and facilitate. Closed door innovation does not work; innovation as driving force\n\nFrom at least 2017 to 2019 when Chen was serving in several advisory roles for the PRC and PRC entities, Chen applied for and obtained a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) grant in order to fund a portion of his research at MIT.\u00a0 In doing so, it is alleged that Chen failed to disclose information about his ongoing affiliations with the PRC as required by DOE.\n\nChen also allegedly failed to disclose to the IRS in his 2018 tax return that he maintained a bank account in the PRC with more than $10,000 in 2018.\n\nThe charge of wire fraud provides for a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000. The charge of making false statements provides for a sentence of up to five years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000.

            "article_text": "ALBUQUERQUE \u2013 Bo Cai, 28, a  Chinese national, pleaded guilty in the U.S. District Court for the District of  New Mexico this afternoon to violating the Arms Export Control Act and the  International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) by scheming illegally to  export defense articles with military application to the People\u2019s Republic of  China.\u00a0 The guilty plea was announced by Damon P. Martinez, U.S. Attorney  for the District of New Mexico and Dennis A. Ulrich, II, Special Agent in  Charge of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in El Paso, Texas.\n\nBo Cai entered a guilty plea to a three-count superseding indictment charging  him and his cousin, Wentong Cai, 29, a Chinese national in the United States on  a student Visa, with a scheme illegally to export sensors primarily  manufactured for sale to the U.S. Department of Defense for use in high-level  applications, such as line-of-sight stabilization and precision motion control  systems.\u00a0 The Arms Export Control Act and the ITAR prohibit the export of  defense-related materials from the United States without obtaining a license or  written approval from the U.S. Department of State.\n\nIn announcing the guilty plea, U.S. Attorney Damon P. Martinez said, \u201cIt is a  top priority for the Justice Department and the District of New Mexico to  protect our national security and our technology from disclosure to foreign  governments.\u00a0 This prosecution demonstrates the federal law enforcement  community\u2019s commitment to safeguarding our nation\u2019s military secrets by keeping  America\u2019s critical technology from falling into the wrong hands.\u201d\n\nHSI Special Agent in Charge Dennis A. Ulrich, II, said, \u201cOne of HSI's highest  priorities is to prevent illicit procurement networks from illegally obtaining  U.S. military products, sensitive dual-use technology, weapons of mass  destruction (WMD), or chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear  materials.\u00a0 This investigation reflects the outstanding efforts of HSI and  its partner agencies in protecting American ingenuity and sensitive military  hardware.\u00a0 HSI will continue to aggressively investigate this type of  crime and bring those individuals who pose a threat to the world's security to  justice.\u201d\n\nIn his plea agreement, Bo Cai admitted that from March 2012 to Dec. 2013, he  conspired illegally to export sensors from the United States to China without  first obtaining the required export license.\u00a0 According to the plea  agreement, in March 2012, Bo Cai, who was then employed by a technology company  in China, embarked on an illegal scheme to smuggle sensors out of the United  States to China for one of his customers despite knowledge that the sensors  could not be exported without a license and that the United States did not  issue licenses to export the sensors to China.\u00a0 Bo Cai enlisted Wentong  Cai to acquire the sensors under the ruse that he planned to use the sensors at  Iowa State University where he was a graduate microbiology student.\n\nCourt  filings indicate that the investigation of this case began in Oct. 2013, when  an undercover HSI agent responded to Wentong Cai\u2019s overtures. After  negotiations by telephone and email, Bo Cai and Wentong Cai traveled to New  Mexico in Dec. 2013, where they obtained a sensor from undercover HSI agents  and developed a plan for smuggling the sensor out of the United States to  China.\u00a0 On Dec. 11, 2013, Bo Cai was arrested at an airport in Los  Angeles, Calif., as he was preparing to board a flight to China after the  sensor was discovered concealed in a computer speaker in his luggage.\n\nAt  sentencing, Bo Cai faces a statutory maximum penalty of 20 years in prison on  the Arms Export Control Act charge, ten years in prison on the smuggling  charge, and five years on the conspiracy charge.\u00a0 Under the terms of his  plea agreement, Bo Cai will be deported after completing his prison  sentence.\u00a0 He remains in custody pending his sentencing hearing, which has  yet to be scheduled.\n\nWentong Cai was arrested in Iowa and was transferred to the District of New  Mexico in Jan. 2014.\u00a0 He has entered a not guilty plea to the charges in  the superseding indictment and remains in federal custody pending trial, which  currently is scheduled to begin on Aug. 18, 2014.\u00a0 Charges in indictments  are merely accusations and defendants are presumed innocent unless found guilty  beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThe Albuquerque office of HSI led the investigation of this case with  assistance from the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations, the  Defense Security Service, HSI in Iowa and Los Angeles, Calif., and the  FBI.\u00a0 Iowa State University cooperated throughout with HSI\u2019s  investigation.\u00a0 Assistant U.S. Attorneys Dean S. Tuckman and Fred J.  Federici of the District of New Mexico are prosecuting the case with assistance  from Deputy Chief Deborah Curtis and Trial Attorney David Recker of the Justice  Department\u2019s National Security Division, Counterespionage Section, the U.S.  Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s  Office for the Southern District of Iowa.",

Bowler in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nYanqing Ye, 29, a Chinese national, was charged in an indictment today with one count each of visa fraud, making false statements, acting as an agent of a foreign government and conspiracy. Ye is currently in China.\n\nZaosong Zheng, 30, a Chinese national, was arrested on Dec. 10, 2019, at Boston\u2019s Logan International Airport and charged by criminal complaint with attempting to smuggle 21 vials of biological research to China. \u00a0On Jan. 21, 2020, Zheng was indicted on one count of smuggling goods from the United States and one count of making false, fictitious or fraudulent statements.\u00a0 He has been detained since Dec. 30, 2019.\n\nDr. Charles Lieber\n\nAccording to court documents, since 2008, Dr. Lieber who has served as the Principal Investigator of the Lieber Research Group at Harvard University, which specialized in the area of nanoscience, has received more than $15,000,000 in grant funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Department of Defense (DOD). \u00a0These grants require the disclosure of significant foreign financial conflicts of interest, including financial support from foreign governments or foreign entities. Unbeknownst to Harvard University beginning in 2011, Lieber became a \u201cStrategic Scientist\u201d at Wuhan University of Technology (WUT) in China and was a contractual participant in China\u2019s Thousand Talents Plan from in or about 2012 to 2017. \u00a0China\u2019s Thousand Talents Plan is one of the most prominent Chinese Talent recruit plans that are designed to attract, recruit, and cultivate high-level scientific talent in furtherance of China\u2019s scientific development, economic prosperity and national security. \u00a0These talent programs seek to lure Chinese overseas talent and foreign experts to bring their knowledge and experience to China and reward individuals for stealing proprietary information.\u00a0 Under the terms of Lieber\u2019s three-year Thousand Talents contract, WUT paid Lieber $50,000 USD per month, living expenses of up to 1,000,000 Chinese Yuan (approximately $158,000 USD at the time) and awarded him more than $1.5 million to establish a research lab at WUT. \u00a0In return, Lieber was obligated to work for WUT \u201cnot less than nine months a year\u201d by \u201cdeclaring international cooperation projects, cultivating young teachers and Ph.D. students, organizing international conference[s], applying for patents and publishing articles in the name of\u201d WUT.\n\nThe complaint alleges that in 2018 and 2019, Lieber lied about his involvement in the Thousand Talents Plan and affiliation with WUT.\u00a0 On or about, April 24, 2018, during an interview with investigators, Lieber stated that he was never asked to participate in the Thousand Talents Program, but he \u201cwasn\u2019t sure\u201d how China categorized him. \u00a0In November 2018, NIH inquired of Harvard whether Lieber had failed to disclose his then-suspected relationship with WUT and China\u2019s Thousand Talents Plan. \u00a0Lieber caused Harvard to falsely tell NIH that Lieber \u201chad no formal association with WUT\u201d after 2012, that \u201cWUT continued to falsely exaggerate\u201d his involvement with WUT in subsequent years, and that Lieber \u201cis not and has never been a participant in\u201d China\u2019s Thousand Talents Plan.\n\nYanqing Ye\n\nAccording to the indictment, Ye is a Lieutenant of the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA), the armed forces of the People\u2019s Republic of China and member of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). \u00a0On her J-1 visa application, Ye falsely identified herself as a \u201cstudent\u201d and lied about her ongoing military service at the National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), a top military academy directed by the CCP.\u00a0 It is further alleged that while studying at Boston University\u2019s (BU) Department of Physics, Chemistry and Biomedical Engineering from October 2017 to April 2019, Ye continued to work as a PLA Lieutenant completing numerous assignments from PLA officers such as conducting research, assessing U.S. military websites and sending U.S. documents and information to China.\n\nAccording to court documents, on April 20, 2019, federal officers interviewed Ye at Boston\u2019s Logan International Airport. During the interview, it is alleged that Ye falsely claimed that she had minimal contact with two NUDT professors who were high-ranking PLA officers.\u00a0 However, a search of Ye\u2019s electronic devices demonstrated that at the direction of one NUDT professor, who was a PLA Colonel, Ye had accessed U.S. military websites, researched U.S. military projects and compiled information for the PLA on two U.S. scientists with expertise in robotics and computer science. \u00a0Furthermore, a review of a WeChat conversation revealed that Ye and the other PLA official from NUDT were collaborating on a research paper about a risk assessment model designed to decipher data for military applications. \u00a0During the interview, Ye admitted that she held the rank of Lieutenant in the PLA and admitted she was a member of the CCP.\n\nZaosong Zheng\n\nIn August 2018, Zheng entered the United States on a J-1 visa and conducted cancer-cell research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston from Sept. 4, 2018, to Dec. 9, 2019. It is alleged that on Dec. 9, 2019, Zheng stole 21 vials of biological research and attempted to smuggle them out of the United States aboard a flight destined for China. \u00a0Federal officers at Logan Airport discovered the vials hidden in a sock inside one of Zheng\u2019s bags, and not properly packaged.\u00a0 It is alleged that initially, Zheng lied to officers about the contents of his luggage, but later admitted he had stolen the vials from a lab at Beth Israel. \u00a0Zheng stated that he intended to bring the vials to China to use them to conduct research in his own laboratory and publish the results under his own name.\n\nThe charge of making false, fictitious and fraudulent statements provides for a sentence of up to five years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000. \u00a0The charge of visa fraud provides for a sentence of up to 10 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000. \u00a0The charge of acting as an agent of a foreign government provides for a sentence of up to 10 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000.

            "article_text": "HOUSTON - The five leaders and eight other co-conspirators have been sentenced for their roles in one of the largest synthetic cannabinoids distribution networks in the United States, announced U.S. Attorney Ryan Patrick. The sentences ranged from 140 months in federal prison for a leader to probation for an hourly wage clerk who sold the drugs.\n\nThe defendants were sentenced for their involvement in the manufacture, possession and distribution of synthetic cannabinoids commonly, but mistakenly, referred to as synthetic marijuana.\n\nToday, U.S. District Judge Gray Miller ordered Khader Fahed Tanous, 52, of Manassas, Virginia, who distributed large amounts of synthetic cannabinoids to Houston area distributors, to 121 months imprisonment. Earlier this week, Judge Miller sentenced Muhammad Shariq Siddiqi, 48, of Sugar Land, to 140 months in prison. Siddiqi was a major manufacturer and distributor in the Houston area.\n\nAlso sentenced today was Ayisha Khurram, Siddiqi\u2019s partner in manufacturing and distributing synthetic cannabinoids as was the de facto owner of the Smoke Zone Khalil Munier Khalil, 43, of Spring. The Smoke Zone was the most prolific distribution store front in the country for synthetic cannabinoids. Khalil was sentenced to a 135-month prison term while Khurram received a 95-month term of imprisonment.\n\nToday, Judge Miller further sentenced Sayed Ali, 53, of Sugar Land; Abdalnour Izz, 33, of Houston; Steve Amira, 61, of Richmond; Mohammed Rafat Taha, 29, of Spring; and Frank Muratalla, 25, of Downey, California.\n\nSiddiqi paid Ali to dilute, mix and apply the chemicals he supplied to the plant material. Izz delivered the drugs and collected payments for Tanous. Amira was the owner of Houston Beverage and a synthetic cannabinoids distributor. Ali received a sentence of 50 months, while Izz and Amira were each sentenced to 36 months.\n\nMuratalla, who worked for out of state manufacturers of synthetic cannabinoids here in Houston, and Taha, a clerk at Smoke Zone, who sold packages of synthetic cannabinoids were both sentenced to four-year-terms of probation.\n\nAlso sentenced this week were other distributors and managers involved in the distribution of synthetic cannabinoids in the Houston area. Those included Salem Fahed Tannous, 58, of Houston (Khader Tanous\u2019s brother who collected money for him from synthetic narcotics sales), Ali Tafesh, 37, of Houston, who owned and distributed the drugs from a store named Azell Cell Phones, Hazim Hisham Qadus, 34, a permanent resident alien who resided in Houston and distributed drugs from a store named Moon Mart and Azell Cell Phones and Nagy Ali, 61 of Spring, the manager of Smoke Zone. Tannous was ordered to serve 49 months in prison, while Tafesh, Qadus will both serve sentences of 97 months. Nagy Ali received a 120-month-prison term for his role.\n\nThroughout the three days of hearings and the handing down of these sentences, the court\u2019s repeated theme was its concern that the dangerous drugs these defendants were manufacturing were being marketed and distributed to juveniles.\n\nSiddiqi and Qadus are not U.S. Citizens and are expected to face deportation proceedings following the completion of their prison terms.\n\nOmar Maher Alnasser, a 37-year old resident of Sugar Land and former University of Houston professor, was previously sentenced to 12 months and one day in prison for aiding and abetting an unlicensed money transmitting business.\u00a0 He had admitted he was paid to wire more than $200,000 in U.S. currency from a bank in the United States to accounts in the country of Jordan.\n\nThe dismantling of this organizations and the convictions are the result of a multi-year, multi-agency federal investigation into one of the largest synthetic distribution networks in the nation and operated in the Houston area dubbed \u201cWe Can Hear You Now.\u201d\n\nAll 13 defendants sentenced this week were convicted of conspiring to distribute a variety of synthetic cannabinoids, all Schedule I controlled substances.\u00a0 In committing the offense, several co-conspirators were accused in a scheme to defraud by marketing their products as though they were safe labeled the drugs as \u201cpotpourri\u201d or \u201cincense,\u201d with some labels including false information such as \u201c100% legal,\u201d \u201clab certified\u201d or \u201cnot for human consumption,\u201d when in fact these products were dangerous drugs.\n\nThere are no standards for making synthetic cannabinoids which contain hazardous chemicals often imported from China that, when smoked or ingested, could have serious (sometimes deadly) side effects. Frequently, as in this case, various \u201cbrands\u201d are mixed together in the same cement mixer, so two packets of a brand-named product may have the identical chemicals. Often, the same cement mixers are used for multiple batches of synthetic cannabinoids, so the \u201cfinal\u201d products may also be contaminated with other drugs or toxic chemicals from previous batches.\n\nThe amounts of synthetic cannabinoid in packages may also vary even within the same batches because the product is not mixed uniformly within the cement mixers. Therefore, \u201chot packages\u201d with a higher concentration of the applied chemical are a common danger. According to the Center for Disease Control, synthetic cannabinoids may cause hallucinations, delusions, psychosis, suicidal thoughts and violent behavior. \u00a0The health problems associated with the drug include heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, breathing problems and muscle damage.\n\nThe drugs the defendants admitted to having distributed were all Schedule I drugs \u2013 substances or chemicals with no currently accepted medical use, have a high potential for abuse, are the most dangerous drugs of all scheduled drugs and have potential for severe psychological or physical dependence. The packaging was also typical of synthetic cannabinoids - contained colorful illustrations that targeted not only drug abusers, but also children and adolescents.\n\nIn connection with this case, authorities are still seeking Ziad Mahmoud Alsalameh, 56, of Pearland, and Aqil Khader, 33, of Houston. They are considered fugitives and warrants remain outstanding for their arrests. Anyone with information about their whereabouts are asked to contact DEA at 713-693-3000.\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration, Houston Police Department, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and IRS \u2013 Criminal Investigation conducted the four-year investigation with the assistance of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Conroe Police Department, sheriff\u2019s offices in Harris and Polk counties, Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission and the Montgomery County District Attorney\u2019s Office. Assistant U.S. Attorneys John Jocher and Nancy Herrera prosecuted the case.",

Rosenstein; Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers; U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman for the Southern District of New York; FBI Director Christopher A. Wray; Assistant Director in Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. of the FBI\u2019s New York Field Division; and Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Sigal Mandelker.\n\n\u201cThese nine Iranian nationals allegedly stole more than 31 terabytes of documents and data from more than 140 American universities, 30 American companies, five American government agencies, and also more than 176 universities in 21 foreign countries,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein.\u00a0 \u201cFor many of these intrusions, the defendants acted at the behest of the Iranian government and, specifically, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.\u00a0 The Department of Justice will aggressively investigate and prosecute hostile actors who attempt to profit from America\u2019s ideas by infiltrating our computer systems and stealing intellectual property.\u00a0 This case is important because it will disrupt the defendants\u2019 hacking operations and deter similar crimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, in one of the largest state-sponsored hacking campaigns ever prosecuted by the Department of Justice, we have unmasked criminals who normally hide behind the ones and zeros of computer code,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Berman.\u00a0 \u201cAs alleged, this massive and brazen cyber-assault on the computer systems of hundreds of universities in 22 countries and dozens of private sector companies and governmental organizations was conducted on behalf of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard.\u00a0 The hackers targeted innovations and intellectual property from our country\u2019s greatest minds.\u00a0 These defendants are now fugitives from American justice, no longer free to travel outside Iran without risk of arrest.\u00a0 The only way they will see the outside world is through their computer screens, but stripped of their greatest asset \u2013 anonymity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis investigation involved a complex threat in a dynamic landscape, but today\u2019s announcement highlights the commitment of the FBI and our partners to vigorously pursue those that threaten U.S. property and security,\u201d said Director Wray.\u00a0 \u201cToday, not only are we publicly identifying the foreign hackers who committed these malicious cyber intrusions, but we are also sending a powerful message to their backers, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran: your acts do not go unnoticed.\u00a0 We will protect our innovation, ideas and information, and we will use every tool in our toolbox to expose those who commit these cyber crimes.\u00a0 Our memory is long; we will hold them accountable under the law, no matter where they attempt to hide.\u201d\n\nAccording to the allegations contained in the Indictment unsealed today in Manhattan federal court:\n\nBackground on the Mabna Institute\n\nGholamreza Rafatnejad and Ehsan Mohammadi, the defendants, founded the Mabna Institute in approximately 2013 to assist Iranian universities and scientific and research organizations in stealing access to non-Iranian scientific resources.\u00a0 In furtherance of its mission, the Mabna Institute employed, contracted, and affiliated itself with hackers-for-hire and other contract personnel to conduct cyber intrusions to steal academic data, intellectual property, email inboxes and other proprietary data, including Abdollah Karima, aka Vahid Karima, Mostafa Sadeghi, Seyed Ali Mirkarimi, Mohammed Reza Sabahi, Roozbeh Sabahi, Abuzar Gohari Moqadam, and Sajjad Tahmasebi.\u00a0 The Mabna Institute contracted with both Iranian governmental and private entities to conduct hacking activities on their behalf, and specifically conducted the university spearphishing campaign on behalf of the IRGC.\u00a0 The Mabna Institute is located at Tehran, Sheikh Bahaii Shomali, Koucheh Dawazdeh Metri Sevom, Plak 14, Vahed 2, Code Posti 1995873351.\n\nUniversity Hacking Campaign\n\nThe Mabna Institute, through the activities of the defendants, targeted more than 100,000 accounts of professors around the world.\u00a0 They successfully compromised approximately 8,000 professor email accounts across 144 U.S.-based universities, and 176 universities located in foreign countries, including Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Kingdom.\u00a0 The campaign started in approximately 2013, continued through at least December 2017, and broadly targeted all types of academic data and intellectual property from the systems of compromised universities.\u00a0 Through the course of the conspiracy, U.S.-based universities spent more than approximately $3.4 billion to procure and access such data and intellectual property.\n\nThe members of the conspiracy used stolen account credentials to obtain unauthorized access to victim professor accounts, which they used to steal research, and other academic data and documents, including, among other things, academic journals, theses, dissertations, and electronic books.\u00a0 The defendants targeted data across all fields of research and academic disciplines, including science and technology, engineering, social sciences, medical, and other professional fields.\u00a0 The defendants stole at least approximately 31.5 terabytes of academic data and intellectual property, which they exfiltrated to servers outside the United States that were under the control of members of the conspiracy.\n\nIn addition to stealing academic data and login credentials for the benefit of the Government of Iran, the defendants also sold the stolen data through two websites, Megapaper.ir (Megapaper) and Gigapaper.ir (Gigapaper).\u00a0 Megapaper was operated by Falinoos Company, a company controlled by Abdollah Karima, aka Vahid Karima, the defendant, and Gigapaper was affiliated with Karima.\u00a0 Megapaper sold stolen academic resources to customers within Iran, including Iran-based public universities and institutions, and Gigapaper sold a service to customers within Iran whereby purchasing customers could use compromised university professor accounts to directly access the online library systems of particular U.S.-based and foreign universities.\n\nAccompanying Mitigation Efforts\n\nPrior to the unsealing of the Indictment, the FBI provided foreign law enforcement partners with detailed information regarding victims within their jurisdictions, so that victims in foreign countries could be notified and foreign partners could assist in remediation efforts.\n\nAlso, in connection with the unsealing of the Indictment, today the FBI provided private sector partners detailed information regarding the vulnerabilities targeted and the intrusion vectors used by the Mabna Institute in their campaign against private sector companies.\u00a0 This information will assist the public in its network defense and mitigation efforts.\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\n\n\n\nRafatnejad, Mohammadi, Karima, Sadeghi, Mirkarimi, Sabahi, Sabahi, Moqadam and Tahmasebi was each is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusions, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; two counts of unauthorized access of a computer, each of which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; two counts of wire fraud, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; and one count of aggravated identity theft, which carries a mandatory sentence of two years in prison.\u00a0 The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencings of the defendants will be determined by the assigned judge.\n\nMr. Rosenstein and Mr. Berman praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI, the assistance of the United Kingdom\u2019s National Crime Agency (NCA), and the support of the OFAC.\u00a0 Assistant U.S. Attorneys Timothy T.

            "article_text": "The first Chinese government intelligence officer ever to be extradited to the United States to stand trial was sentenced today in federal court in Cincinnati.\n\nYanjun Xu, 42, was sentenced to 20 years in prison. According to court documents, Xu targeted American aviation companies, recruited employees to travel to China, and solicited their proprietary information, all on behalf of the government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).\n\n\u201cAs proven at trial, the defendant, a Chinese government intelligence officer, used a range of techniques to attempt to steal technology and proprietary information from companies based in both the U.S. and abroad,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \u201cToday\u2019s sentence demonstrates the seriousness of those crimes and the Justice Department\u2019s determination to investigate and prosecute efforts by the Chinese government, or any foreign power, to\u00a0threaten our economic and national security.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis case sends a clear message: we will hold accountable anyone attempting to steal American trade secrets,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Kenneth L. Parker for the Southern District of Ohio. \u201cXu conspired to steal American science and technology. Thanks to the diligent work of the FBI, GE Aviation and our trial team, he\u2019ll spend decades in federal prison.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis case is just the latest example of the Chinese government\u2019s continued attacks on American economic security \u2013 and, by extension, our national security,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \u201cThe Chinese government tasked an officer of its spy service to steal U.S. trade secrets so it could advance its own commercial and military aviation efforts, at the expense of an American company. This brazen action shows that the Chinese government will stop at nothing to put our companies out of business to the detriment of U.S. workers. As long as the Chinese government continues to break our laws and threaten American industry and institutions, the FBI will work with its partners across the globe to bring those responsible to justice.\u201d\n\nOn Nov. 5, 2021, a federal jury in CincinnaticonvictedXu on all counts: conspiracy to commit economic espionage, conspiracy to commit trade secret theft, attempted economic espionage and attempted trade secret theft.\n\nXu was a career intelligence officer, beginning in 2003 and rising to the rank of deputy division director at the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS), the intelligence and security agency for China.\n\nAccording to court documents and trial testimony, beginning in at least December 2013, Xu targeted specific companies in the United States and abroad that are recognized as leaders in the field of aviation.\n\nXu used aliases, front companies and universities to deceive aviation employees and solicit information. He identified individuals who worked for the companies and recruited them to travel to China, often initially under the guise that they were traveling to give a presentation at a university. Xu and others paid the individuals stipends on top of covering travel costs.\n\nThe scheme was executed with full coordination between the MSS and China\u2019s aviation entities. Xu worked with others in the MSS to hack or copy computers in hotel rooms while the aviation employees \u2013 his \u201cguests\u201d \u2013 were taken to dinner by the MSS.\n\nXu also openly talked about efforts to obtain U.S. military information in addition to commercial aviation trade secrets.\n\nAttempted GE Aviation trade secret theft\n\nXu attempted to steal technology related to GE Aviation\u2019s exclusive composite aircraft engine fan module \u2013 which no other company in the world has been able to duplicate \u2013 to benefit the Chinese state.\n\nIn March 2017, a GE Aviation employee in Cincinnati was solicited to give a report at a university in China. The employee traveled to China two months later to present at the university and was introduced to Xu. Xu and others paid the employee\u2019s travel expenses and a stipend.\n\nAfter the trip to China, the FBI took over communications with Xu, posing as the employee.\n\nIn January 2018, Xu requested \u201csystem specification, design process\u201d information from the employee and \u2013 with the cooperation of GE Aviation, who was working with the FBI \u2013 the employee emailed a two-page document from the company that included a label that warned about the disclosure of proprietary information.\n\nIn February 2018, Xu began discussing with the employee the possibility of meeting in Europe during one of the employee\u2019s business trips and asked the employee to send a copy of the file directory for his company-issued computer.\n\nXu traveled to Belgium with cash and pictures of the employee on April 1, 2018. He was scheduled to meet with the employee and was arrested at that time.\n\nThe Department of Justice\u2019s Office of International Affairs secured Xu\u2019s extradition to the United States, with valuable assistance provided by the government of Belgium, as well as the Belgian Federal Police.\n\nHandling of MSS spy in Chicago\n\nIn September 2022, a federal jury in Chicago convicted an individual (Ji Chaoqun) for working on behalf of the MSS under the direction of Xu.\n\nXu served as Ji\u2019s MSS handler while Ji, a Chinese citizen, lived and studied in Chicago. Xu officially registered Ji as a formal MSS overseas agent in January 2014 and directed Ji to collect biographical information on people to potentially recruit to work with them.\n\nXu provided Ji with the names of at least nine individuals in America to attempt to recruit. Ji obtained and provided Xu with more detailed background reports on the individuals. Ji also received training on how to speak to the FBI if approached at his school.\n\nIn May 2016, Ji joined the U.S. Army through a program that allowed legal aliens with vital skills like Chinese fluency. Ji told Xu and the MSS that he had successfully infiltrated the U.S. military as an MSS officer. His plan was to obtain citizenship quickly and obtain a top-secret security clearance.\n\nJi reported to an undercover FBI agent that he had access to all military bases with his military ID and volunteered, without prompting, to take pictures of aircraft carriers for the MSS.\n\nThe crimes committed by Ji were done on behalf of the MSS, through Xu Yanjun.\n\n\u201cXu\u2019s handling and placement of a spy within the United States to obtain information regarding aviation technology and employees is yet another facet of Xu\u2019s egregious crimes towards the United States and further justifies the significant sentence of imprisonment he received today,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Parker.\n\nThe MSS hacking of a French aerospace manufacturer\n\nThe evidence at trial showed Xu recruited insiders within a French aircraft engine manufacturer\u2019s facility in China who were willing to spy on Xu\u2019s behalf. Xu and his assets targeted a French employee of the company that often traveled to the facility in China for work. In 2013, Xu directed one of his assets within the company to plant malware on the French employee\u2019s work computer, with the ultimate goal of being able to infiltrate the company\u2019s network in France. The evidence at trial also showed Xu\u2019s integral role in the installation of the malware, his instructions to destroy the malware, and Xu\u2019s monitoring of the success and cover-up of the operation.\n\nThe FBI investigated the case. The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs and the U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices for the Northern District of Illinois and the District of Arizona provided valuable assistance.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Timothy S. Mangan and Deputy Criminal Chief Emily N. Glatfelter for the Southern District of Ohio and Trial Attorney Matthew J. McKenzie of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section represented the United States in this case.",

            "article_text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 A Chinese national pleaded guilty today in federal court in Boston in connection with illegally procuring and causing the illegal export of $100,000 worth of U.S. origin goods to Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU), a Chinese military university that is heavily involved in military research and works closely with the People\u2019s Liberation Army on the advancement of its military capabilities.\n\nAccording to court documents, Shuren Qin, 44, a Chinese national residing in Wellesley, Mass., gained admittance into the United States through the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Visa Program in 2014 and established LinkOcean Technologies, LTD., which he used to import goods and technology with underwater and marine applications into the PRC from the United States, Canada and Europe. Today, he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to unlawfully export items from the United States to NWPU without first obtaining the required export licenses; one count of visa fraud; two counts of making false statements to law enforcement agents regarding his customers and the types of parts he caused to be exported from the United States to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC); four counts of money laundering; and two counts of smuggling hydrophones from the U.S. to the PRC.\n\n\u201cQin took advantage of the open marketplace in the United States to purchase sensitive technologies for a Chinese military university,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers for the Justice Department's National Security Division. \u201cIn addition, he lied on his visa application and to U.S. customs officers. When individuals illegally pursue personal profit at the expense of U.S. national security, DOJ will disrupt such conduct and punish those involved.\u201d\n\n\"The People\u2019s Republic of China has an insatiable appetite for our country\u2019s most sensitive products and technologies \u2013 particularly those with military applications,\u201d said Acting U.S. Attorney Nathaniel R. Mendell for the District of Massachusetts.\u00a0\u201cBy exporting key anti-submarine warfare products to a Chinese military university, Mr. Qin created a threat to our national security and broke the law. That warrants federal prosecution, without a doubt.\u201d\n\nNWPU has been involved in the development of unmanned aerial vehicles, autonomous underwater vehicles and missile proliferation projects. Since 2001, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) has designated NWPU on its Entity List for national security reasons. Qin communicated with and received purchase orders from NWPU to obtain items used for anti-submarine warfare. Between approximately July 2015 and December 2016, Qin caused at least 60 hydrophones (devices used to detect and monitor sound underwater) to be exported from the United States to NWPU without obtaining the required export licenses from the DOC. Qin and his company, LinkOcean, did so by concealing from the U.S. manufacturer of the hydrophones that NWPU was the true end-user and by causing false end-user information to be filed with the U.S. government. In addition, on four occasions in connection with the export of hydrophones to NWPU, Qin engaged in money laundering by transferring or causing the transfer of more than $100,000 from Chinese bank accounts to bank accounts located in the United States with the intent to promote and facilitate his unlawful export scheme.\n\nAdditionally, in July 2016, Qin engaged in visa fraud in connection with his application to remove conditions on his U.S. Permanent Resident Status (Form I-829) by falsely certifying that he had not committed any crime for which he was not arrested since becoming a conditional permanent resident when, in fact, he had caused the illegal export of hydrophones in 2015. In addition, Qin made false statements to federal agents on two occasions regarding LinkOcean\u2019s customers and its export activities. Specifically, during a November 2017 interview with Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Officers, Qin falsely stated that he only exported instruments that attach to a buoy. However, Qin had exported and caused the export of remotely operated side scan sonar systems, unmanned underwater vehicles, unmanned surface vehicles, robotic boats and hydrophones. The items that Qin concealed from CBP during this interview have military applications and several of these items were delivered to military end-users in China. On or about July 21, 2018, Qin lied to investigators when he stated that he did not have any customers on the DOC\u2019s Entity List when he had at least two such customers \u2013 NWPU and the National University of Defense Technology (NUDT). NUDT has been designated on DOC\u2019s Entity List and is involved modernizing the PRC\u2019s armed forces\n\nPrior to entering his guilty plea, Qin moved to suppress evidence seized from his laptop and iPhone during a border search and statements he made to CBP officers during a secondary in November 2017. Judge Casper found that the \u201cChinese Navy\u201d was one of Qin\u2019s customer\u2019s according to LinkOcean\u2019s website and when the border search occurred, agents testified that they were \u201cconcerned that Qin was involved [in] working on behalf of the Chinese Navy to procure items from the United States, export them to China so that they could be used or incorporated in systems the Chinese Navy or research institutes were developing to be used in electronic warfare, anti-submarine warfare.\u201d\n\nBy the end of the summer of 2017, investigators had learned that Qin was interested in procuring both AUVs and sonobuoys, which raised concerns for the agents as they learned that Ultra Electronics was at that same time developing \u201can AUV that worked in conjunction with [a] sonobuoy \u2026 strictly for military use by the U.S. Navy.\u201d Qin also lied when questioned during the secondary inspection at the border regarding the types of parts he exported, concealing his \u201cinterest in procuring side scan sonar systems, AUVs, and sonobuoys.\u201d\n\nThe charge of conspiring to violate U.S. export laws provides for a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $1 million. The charges of visa fraud and smuggling both provide for a sentence of up to 10 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000. The charge of making false statements provides for a sentence of up to five years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000.\u00a0 The charge or money laundering provides for a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, five years of supervised release and a fine of $500,000 fine. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney B. Stephanie Siegmann, Chief of Mendell\u2019s National Security Unit, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason Casey, also of National Security Unit, are prosecuting the case. Valuable assistance was provided by the Justice Department's National Security Division.",

            "article_text": "GAINESVILLE, FLORIDA\u2013 A former University of Florida (UF) professor and researcher and resident of China has been indicted for fraudulently obtaining $1.75 million in federal grant money from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) by concealing support he received from the Chinese government and a company that he founded in China to profit from that research.\n\nLin Yang, 43, who resided in Tampa, Florida, at the time of the offenses, is charged with six counts of wire fraud and four counts of making false statements to an agency of the United States. The indictment, returned by a federal grand jury on Dec. 15, 2020, was unsealed today.\n\n\u201cTransparency about foreign funding sources allows federal agencies to allocate finite resources fairly.\u00a0Transparency about foreign government affiliations, like business affiliations, allows the research community and the American people to assess any impact on the integrity of the research,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers for the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division.\u00a0\u201cAccording to the indictment, the defendant intentionally deceived both his employer and the federal government in order to obtain more than a million dollars in research funding. Rather than being open about his ties to the People\u2019s Republic of China, the defendant chose to conceal them, in the process advancing both the Chinese government\u2019s strategic goals and his own financial interests. The department will continue to protect the foundations of America\u2019s research enterprise\u2014integrity and transparency.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe taxpayer dollars that funded Yang\u2019s research were intended to benefit the health and well-being of U.S. citizens. But our indictment alleges that Yang engaged in acts of deliberate deception so that he could also further the research goals of the Chinese Communist government and advance his own business interests,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Lawrence Keefe for the Northern District of Florida. \u201cWe are committed to working closely with the FBI, the Department of Health and Human Services, and our research institutions to identify, investigate and prosecute anyone who undermines the integrity of our nation\u2019s research efforts by concealing potential conflicts of interest and commitment.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerican taxpayers ought to know whether their money is being used to fund research and development for the benefit of foreign governments and foreign companies,\u201d said Assistant Director Alan E. Kohler Jr. of the FBI's Counterintelligence Division. \u201cThe FBI will always investigate those who break the law by taking federal money while hiding their foreign business and government ties. In doing so, we\u2019re ensuring transparency and protecting the hard-earned dollars of the American public.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States can benefit greatly from hosting foreign researchers in our academic institutions, but this case illustrates how that collaborative environment can also be exploited,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Rachel L. Rojas of the FBI Jacksonville Division.\u00a0\u201cThe Chinese Communist government simply does not play by the same rules of academic integrity that we do.\u00a0The FBI is committed to holding its proxies accountable, and to helping educational institutions protect cutting-edge research and technologies from foreign adversaries who are determined to defeat the U.S. at any cost.\u201d\n\n\u201cTaxpayers fund medical research in the hope that promising scientific breakthroughs will result in much-needed treatments and cures for patients.\u00a0Such funding should be based on a transparent understanding of potential conflicts of interest and commitment,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge\u00a0Omar P\u00e9rez Aybar\u00a0of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG). \u201cWorking with our law enforcement partners, we will assiduously investigate rogue researchers who conceal their foreign support.\u201d\n\nAccording to the indictment, Yang obtained a $1.75 million grant from NIH to develop and disseminate an imaging informatics tool for muscles known as \u201cMuscleMiner.\u201d Between September 2014 and July 2019, Yang served as the principal investigator for the NIH grant at UF. As the principal investigator, Yang was responsible for conducting and administering the grant in compliance with applicable federal law and institutional policies. Among other things, Yang was required to disclose his foreign research support and financial conflicts of interest, including his ownership of, or interest in, a foreign company.\n\nDuring that same period, in 2016, Yang established a business in China known as \u201cDeep Informatics.\u201d The indictment further alleges that Yang promoted his business in China by relating that its products were the result of years of research supported by millions of dollars of U.S. government funding. Simultaneously, Yang applied for and was accepted into the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s Thousand Talents Program (TTP) in connection with Northwestern Polytechnical University, located in Xi\u2019an, China. The TTP was a talent plan established by the Chinese government to encourage the transfer of original ideas, technology, and intellectual property from foreign institutions, such as American universities.\n\nIn order to maintain his employment with UF and continue receiving NIH grant money, the indictment alleges that Yang intentionally concealed his conflicts of interest and other support in connection with his Chinese business and his participation in a Chinese government talent plan and affiliation with a Chinese research university. On multiple occasions, Yang submitted disclosures to NIH containing false statements and material omissions concerning his affiliations and research endeavors with a foreign government and company. Additionally, in January 2019, UF\u2019s College of Engineering required all faculty to provide, in writing, updated disclosures concerning activities with foreign entities in China and two other countries. The indictment alleges that Yang provided UF with a written response that falsely stated he had no affiliation with any business, entity, or university in China.\n\nYang traveled to China in August of 2019 and has yet to return to the United States.\n\nEach count of wire fraud carries a maximum sentence of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment and a $250,000 fine. Each count of making false statements to an agency of the United States is punishable by a maximum sentence of five years\u2019 imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.\n\nThe FBI Jacksonville Division and HHS-OIG\u00a0investigated the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen M. Kunz for the Northern District of Florida is prosecuting the case with assistance from the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence & Export Section.\n\nThe charges contained in the indictment are only allegations. A defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.\n\nThe United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Florida is one of 94 offices that serve as the nation\u2019s principal litigators under the direction of the Attorney General.

            "article_text": "LITTLE ROCK\u2014Two rice researchers from China have been charged in a conspiracy to steal rice production technology in an alleged attempt to bring this proprietary science back to China.\n\nCody Hiland, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas, and Diane Upchurch, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI\u2019s Little Rock Field Office, announced the indictment of Liu Xuejun, 49, and Sun Yue, 36, both of China, for conspiracy to steal trade secrets and conspiracy to commit interstate transportation of stolen property.\n\nA federal grand jury returned an indictment against Liu and Sun on Friday for their involvement in the theft of rice seeds designed for use in the medical field. The rice seeds were developed by a company called Ventria Bioscience, which used technology to create rice seeds that contained certain proteins. These proteins could then be removed from the rice and used in medicines and pharmaceutical products. Ventria, which is headquartered in Colorado and has a rice production facility in Kansas, has invested approximately $75 million in developing the intellectual property behind these rice seeds.\n\n\"These rice seeds may be small, but the research and investment that went into the science that made them possible is of great value,\" Hiland said. \"We remain vigilant in our efforts at protecting both intellectual and real property from theft by other nations, and it is our intention to present our case to an Arkansas jury based on the crimes alleged in the indictment.\"\n\nLiu and Sun visited the United States in 2013. At that time, they both worked at the Crops Research Institute in Tianjin, China. Liu was a professor, and Sun was a research associate. They came to the United States to visit several rice research and production facilities, and their visit included a stop at the Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center in Stuttgart.\n\nTheir trip was organized by Weiqiang Zhang, who was a rice breeder at Ventria in Kansas, and Wengui Yan, who worked at the Dale Bumpers Rice Research Center in Stuttgart. When Liu and Sun ended their trip, they flew to Honolulu, Hawaii, on their way back to China. At the Honolulu airport, U.S. Customs and Border Protection found stolen rice seeds in Liu and Sun\u2019s luggage, including seeds from the Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center as well as seeds from the Ventria rice production facility in Kansas.\n\n\"Today\u2019s indictment of Liu and Sun should not go unnoticed by those who seek to steal our trade secrets and technology,\" FBI SAC Upchurch said. \"This type of crime is consistent with China\u2019s social and economic five-year plan to modernize their seed industry. We appreciate the efforts of the United States Attorney\u2019s Office and together we will remain steadfast in protecting the United States\u2019 intellectual property.\"\n\nThe two rice researchers who helped organize Liu and Sun\u2019s trip to the United States were convicted of their involvement in the scheme in a connected case in the District of Kansas (see link to press release below). Zhang, 47, was convicted at trial and sentenced to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment. Yan, 63, who worked in Stuttgart, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to one year in prison.\n\nA violation of conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets, under Title 18, United States Code, Section 1832, carries a maximum penalty of not more than 10 years\u2019 imprisonment, not more than a $250,000 fine, and not more than three years of supervised release. A violation of conspiracy to commit interstate transportation of stolen property, under Title 18, United States Code, Section 371, carries a maximum penalty of not more than five years\u2019 imprisonment, not more than a $250,000 fine, and not more than three years of supervised release.\n\nThe case was investigated by the FBI, and is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Allison W. Bragg. An indictment contains only allegations.

            "article_text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The Justice Department today announced\u00a0that Pen Yu, also known as Ben Yu, 51, of Gibsonton, Florida, and Gregory Mu\u00f1oz, 45, of Minneola, Florida, have each pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud conspiracy for their roles in a scheme to fraudulently procure deeply discounted products from Massachusetts biochemical company Sigma-Aldrich Inc., doing business as MilliporeSigma, and export them to China using falsified export documents.\n\nIn addition, the Justice Department announced that it has\u00a0declined the prosecution\u00a0of MilliporeSigma after considering the factors set forth in the Department\u2019s Principles of Federal Prosecution of Business Organizations and theNational Security Division Enforcement Policy for Business Organizations(NSD Enforcement Policy). The NSD Enforcement Policy creates a presumption that companies that (1)\u00a0voluntarily self-disclose to NSD potentially criminal violations arising out of or relating to the enforcement of export control or sanctions laws, (2) fully cooperate, and (3) timely and appropriately remediate will generally receive a non-prosecution agreement, unless aggravating factors are present. This is the first time that NSD has declined the prosecution of a company under the NSD Enforcement Policy.\n\n\u201cWhen a business\u00a0uncovers criminal wrongdoing within its ranks,\u00a0the company is far better off reporting the violation than waiting for the Justice Department to discover it,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what MilliporeSigma did in the first-ever corporate declination under our National Security Division\u2019s voluntary self-disclosure program. Because of MilliporeSigma\u2019s\u00a0timely disclosure and exceptional\u00a0cooperation, a rogue company insider and his accomplice\u00a0pled guilty to fraudulently diverting millions of dollars worth of biochemicals to China, and the company will not be prosecuted. As national security and corporate crime increasingly intersect, companies that step up and own up under the Department\u2019s voluntary self-disclosure programs can help themselves and our nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen MilliporeSigma found evidence that one of its employees was diverting biochemical products to an unauthorized purchaser in China, they did not sweep the misconduct under the rug. Instead, the company made the early decision to cooperate with the Justice Department, resulting in the convictions of responsible individuals,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement reflects the value for companies like MilliporeSigma to quickly self-disclose potential criminal activity and reaffirms our commitment to work in partnership with the private sector to root out conduct that violates the law and jeopardizes our national security.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen company and university insiders abuse the trust that their institutions place in them, they will be held accountable,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Roger B. Handberg for the Middle District of Florida. \u201cHere, Millipore Sigma\u2019s prompt disclosures led to the uncovering of this multimillion- dollar criminal enterprise, and enabled law enforcement to disrupt the scheme and stop further illegal exports to China. These disclosures led to the seizure of multiple illegal shipments to China and the conviction of two of the most culpable participants in the scheme. Millipore Sigma\u2019s prompt and full cooperation was essential in obtaining this result.\u201d\n\n\u201cFaking an affiliation with an academic research lab to obtain controlled biochemical materials, and then sending those materials to China, is not only wrong, but illegal,\u201d said Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement Matthew S. Axelrod. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement provides yet another fact pattern for universities to beware of \u2014 the misuse of academic institutions by outsiders who seek to obscure the actual customer of controlled items.\u201d\n\nAccording to court documents, beginning in at least July 2016 and continuing through at least May 2023, Yu ordered biochemical products from MilliporeSigma, a subsidiary of multinational science and technology company Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, with help from Mu\u00f1oz, a MilliporeSigma salesperson, by falsely representing that Yu was affiliated with a biology research lab at a large Florida university. This fictitious affiliation led MilliporeSigma to provide Yu over $4.9\u00a0million worth of discounts and other benefits, such as free overnight shipping, not available to the public. Yu gave Mu\u00f1oz thousands of dollars in gift cards for facilitating these fraudulent discounted orders. When the products arrived at the university stockroom, a stockroom employee diverted the products to Yu, who repackaged them and shipped them to China. To avoid scrutiny, Yu made false statements about the value and contents of these shipments in export documents.\n\nThis scheme continued until MilliporeSigma compliance personnel identified certain orders as suspicious, prompting the company to retain outside counsel who voluntarily disclosed the misconduct to the Department of Justice\u2019s National Security Division only a week later. MilliporeSigma made the disclosure well before its counsel had completed their investigation and understood the full nature and extent of the scheme. MilliporeSigma offered exceptional cooperation to the prosecution team, including by proactively identifying and producing documents to the Department that established probable cause to search residences and electronic devices of culpable individuals. MilliporeSigma\u2019s cooperation allowed investigators to quickly identify the individuals responsible for the scheme, including Yu and Mu\u00f1oz, and secure their felony guilty pleas. As a result of MilliporeSigma\u2019s timely self-disclosure and extraordinary cooperation, MilliporeSigma will not be charged, despite the criminal wrongdoing committed by Mu\u00f1oz, a MilliporeSigma employee.\n\nThe Defense Criminal Investigative Service; Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security; and Homeland Security Investigations investigated the case.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Daniel J. Marcet for the Middle District of Florida and Trial Attorney Garrett Coyle of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting the cases.\n\nNote:View theinformationandplea agreementfor Yu.View theinformationandplea agreementfor Mu\u00f1oz.\n\nView the declination letter here.",

Tax cheats are becoming more sophisticated in their schemes and are finding new ways to cheat the system as well as gaining access to your personal and tax information.\n\n\u201cCriminals continue to victimize taxpayers with sophisticated tax fraud schemes,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Byung J. \u201cBJay\u201d Pak.\u00a0 \u201cBe honest, truthful, and timely in your tax filings, and beware of others who look to take advantage of you and the tax system.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose taxpayers who file accurate, honest and timely returns can be assured that the government will hold accountable those who don't.

As detailed in the affidavits in support of those search warrants, federal agents are investigating multiple Chinese maternity operations in Southern California for suspected immigration fraud and tax fraud, as well as failing to report foreign bank accounts in China and Hong Kong.\n\nFederal arrest warrants have been issued for all 11 defendants named in the criminal complaints filed today. All but one of the defendants are charged with obstruction of justice and criminal contempt of court, and 10 of them are also charged with making a false statement on a visa application.\n\nThe defendants charged today are:\n\nDongjiang He (\u8d3a\u4e1c\u6c5f), 46, who last resided in Rancho Cucamonga, allegedly fled with his wife on April 16. On his visa application, Dongjiang He listed his occupation as \u201cGovernment\u201d and his position as \u201cProject Manager and Secretary General\u201d for the China Nonferrous Metals Techno Economic Research Institute, which is located in the Haidian District in Beijing.\n\nHe\u2019s wife, Zhichan Yu (\u4f59\u829d\u5a75), 40, who last resided in Rancho Cucamonga, is a graduate of the Beijing University of Chinese Medicine who allegedly made a false statement on her visa application when she listed that she would be visiting Hawaii for only 15 days, when she actually intended to be in Southern California for several months and give birth.\n\nJun Xiao (\u8096\u4fca), 30, and LongJing Yi (\u6613\u73d1\u9759), 30, who last resided in Irvine, allegedly fled on April 4. According to the affidavit in support of the criminal complaint against them, Xiao and Yi made false statements on their visa applications, namely that they would be staying in the United States for only 15 days. Moreover, Xiao and Yi paid only $4,600 of the $32,291 in hospital charges from Yi\u2019s giving birth at an area hospital, according to court documents. In this case, Yi is charged only with visa fraud as she had not yet appeared before a judge in relation to the government\u2019s application to have her designated as a material witness.\n\nJia Luo (\u7f57\u4f73), 30, who last resided in Rancho Cucamonga, allegedly fled on April 12.

Jie He allegedly made false statements on her visa application, including that she planned to stay in the United States for only 20 days, when she actually entered into a contract to pay approximately $50,000 to obtain a visa and stay in the United States for several months to give birth. According to the affidavit in this case, Jie He told investigators that she flew into Las Vegas, rather than Los Angeles, because the Chinese maternity operator had advised her that it was easier to enter through Las Vegas, according to an affidavit in the case.\n\nEryun Zhang (\u5f20\u5c14\u82b8), 25; her husband, Liang Ni (\u502a\u6881), 25; and her mother, Ji Xu (\u5f90\u6fc0), 50, who last resided in Rancho Cucamonga, allegedly fled on April 14.

According to court documents, 24 patents filed in the People\u2019s Republic of China bear Ang\u2019s name or Chinese birth name. The University of Arkansas, where Ang worked as a professor, required individuals such as Ang to promptly furnish to the University \u201cfull and complete\u201d disclosures of inventions, and University policy provided that it, not individual inventors, would own all inventions created by those subject to the policy. This policy was established \u201cin furtherance of the commitment of the University to the widest possible distribution of the benefits of University Research, the protection of Inventions resulting from such research, and the development of Inventions for the public good.\u201d\n\nDespite this requirement, Ang did not disclose his Chinese patents to the university and, when interviewed by an FBI agent, lied about his involvement in the inventions. Specifically, when asked whether his name would be listed as \u201cthe inventor\u201d of numerous patents in China, Ang denied being the inventor, despite knowing he was. In addition, Ang also received numerous talent awards from the PRC government, which he did not list on the university\u2019s annual conflict of interest disclosure forms.\n\nAng\u2019s sentencing is expected to take place in approximately four months. Ang faces a maximum penalty of 5 years in prison for the crime for which he pleaded guilty, however, the plea agreement also states that if the court wishes to sentence Ang to a sentence that is not a year and a day in federal prison, Ang will have the right to withdraw from the plea agreement. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nU.S. Attorney David Clay Fowlkes of the Western District of Arkansas and Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division made the announcement.\n\nThe FBI, the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Diplomatic Security Service (DSS), NASA Office of Inspector General and Air Force Office of Special Investigations investigated the case.\n\nU.S. Attorney David Clay Fowlkes from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Arkansas and Trial Attorney Christine Bonomo from the Department of Justice National Security Division are prosecuting the case.",

            "article_text": "In August 2019 and August 2020, a federal grand jury in Washington, D.C., returned two separate indictments charging five computer hackers, all of whom were residents and nationals of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), with computer intrusions affecting over 100 victim companies in the United States and abroad, including software development companies, computer hardware manufacturers, telecommunications providers, social media companies, video game companies, non-profit organizations, universities, think tanks, and foreign governments, as well as pro-democracy politicians and activists in Hong Kong.\n\nThe intrusions, which security researchers have tracked using the threat labels \u201cAPT41,\u201d \u201cBarium,\u201d \u201cWinnti,\u201d \u201cWicked Panda,\u201d and \u201cWicked Spider,\u201d facilitated the theft of source code, software code signing certificates, customer account data, and valuable business information.\u00a0 These intrusions also facilitated the defendants\u2019 other criminal schemes, including ransomware and \u201ccrypto-jacking\u201d schemes, the latter of which refers to the group\u2019s unauthorized use of victim computers to \u201cmine\u201d cryptocurrency.\n\nAlso in August 2020, the same federal grand jury returned a third indictment charging two Malaysian businessmen who conspired with two of the Chinese hackers to profit from computer intrusions targeting the video game industry in the United States and abroad.\u00a0 Shortly thereafter, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued arrest warrants for the two businessmen.\u00a0 On Sept. 14, 2020, pursuant to a provisional arrest request from the United States with a view to their extradition, Malaysian authorities arrested them in Sitiawan.\u00a0 The department appreciates the significant cooperation and assistance provided by the Government of Malaysia, including the Attorney General\u2019s Chambers of Malaysia and the Royal Malaysia Police.\n\nIn addition to arrest warrants for all of the charged defendants, in September 2020, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued seizure warrants that resulted in the recent seizure of hundreds of accounts, servers, domain names, and command-and-control (C2\u201d) \u201cdead drop\u201d web pages used by the defendants to conduct their computer intrusion offenses.\u00a0 The FBI executed the warrants in coordination with other actions by several private-sector companies, which included disabling numerous accounts for violations of the companies\u2019 terms of service.\u00a0 In addition, in partnership with the department, Microsoft developed and implemented technical measures to block this threat actor from accessing victims\u2019 computer systems. \u00a0The actions by Microsoft were a significant part of the overall effort to deny the defendants continued access to hacking infrastructure, tools, accounts, and command and control domain names.\u00a0 In coordination with today\u2019s announcement, the FBI has also released a Liaison Alert System (FLASH) report that contains critical, relevant technical information collected by the FBI for use by specific private-sector partners.\n\n\u201cThe department of Justice has used every tool available to disrupt the illegal computer intrusions and cyberattacks by these Chinese citizens,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen.\u00a0 \u201cRegrettably, the Chinese communist party has chosen a different path of making China safe for cybercriminals so long as they attack computers outside China and steal intellectual property helpful to China.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s charges, the related arrests, seizures of malware and other infrastructure used to conduct intrusions, and coordinated private sector protective actions reveal yet again the department\u2019s determination to use all of the tools at its disposal and to collaborate with the private sector and nations who support the rule of law in cyberspace,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers.\u00a0 \u201cThis is the only way to neutralize malicious nation state cyber activity.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement demonstrates the ramifications faced by the hackers in China but it is also a reminder to those who continue to deploy malicious cyber tactics that we will utilize every tool we have to administer justice,\u201d said FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich. \u201cThe arrests in Malaysia are a direct result of partnership, cooperation and collaboration. As the cyber threat continues to evolve larger than any one agency can address, the FBI remains committed to being an indispensable partner to our\u00a0federal, international and private sector partners to stop rampant\u00a0cyber crime\u00a0and\u00a0hold those carrying out these kind of actions accountable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe scope and sophistication of the crimes in these unsealed indictments is unprecedented. The alleged criminal scheme used actors in China and Malaysia to illegally hack, intrude and steal information from victims worldwide,\u201d said Michael R. Sherwin, Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia.\u00a0 \u201cAs set forth in the charging documents, some of these criminal actors believed their association with the PRC provided them free license to hack and steal across the globe.\u00a0 This scheme also contained a new and troubling cyber-criminal component \u2013 the targeting and utilization of gaming platforms to both defraud video game companies and launder illicit proceeds.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe actions announced today reflect a years-long commitment by the FBI Washington Field Office to pursue the perpetrators of the computer intrusion campaigns described in the indictments, and to bring those perpetrators to justice,\u201d said Acting Assistant Director in Charge James A. Dawson, FBI Washington Field Office. \u201cThis case demonstrates the FBI\u2019s dedication to pursuing these criminals no matter where they are, and to whom they may be connected.\u201d\n\nThe August 2019 indictment charged Zhang Haoran (\u5f20\u6d69\u7136), 35, and Tan Dailin (\u8c2d\u6234\u6797), 35, with 25 counts of conspiracy, wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, money laundering, and violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (\u201cCFAA\u201d).\u00a0 The indictment charged Zhang and Tan with participating in a \u201cComputer Hacking Conspiracy,\u201d which targeted high-technology and similar organizations.\u00a0 The indictment also charged that, as an additional way to make money, Zhang and Tan participated in a \u201cVideo Game Conspiracy,\u201d through which Zhang and Tan, together with others, sought to make money by hacking video game companies, obtaining and otherwise generating digital items of value (e.g., video game currency), and then selling such items for profit.\u00a0 In several instances, they used their unauthorized access to gaming company networks take action against other unrelated groups engaged in the same fraudulent generation of gaming artifacts, thereby attempting to eliminate the criminal competition.\n\nOne of the August 2020, indictments charged Jiang Lizhi (\u848b\u7acb\u5fd7), 35, Qian Chuan (\u94b1\u5ddd), 39, and Fu Qiang (\u4ed8\u5f3a), 37, with nine counts of racketeering conspiracy, conspiracy to violate the CFAA, substantive violations of the CFAA, access device fraud, identity theft, aggravated identity theft, and money laundering.\u00a0 The racketeering conspiracy pertained to the three defendants\u2019 conducting the affairs of Chengdu 404 Network Technology (\u201cChengdu 404\u201d), a PRC company, through a pattern of racketeering activity involving computer intrusion offenses affecting over 100 victim companies, organizations, and individuals in the United States and around the world, including in Australia, Brazil, Chile, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. \u00a0The defendants also compromised foreign government computer networks in India and Vietnam, and targeted, but did not compromise, government computer networks in the United Kingdom.\u00a0 In one notable instance, the defendants conducted a ransomware attack on the network of a non-profit organization dedicated to combating global poverty.\n\nThe defendants associated with Chengdu 404 employed sophisticated hacking techniques to gain and maintain access to victim computer networks.\u00a0 One example was the defendants\u2019 use of \u201csupply chain attacks,\u201d in which the hackers compromised software providers and then modified the providers\u2019 code to facilitate further intrusions against the software providers\u2019 customers.\u00a0 Another example was the hackers\u2019 use of C2 \u201cdead drops,\u201d which are seemingly legitimate web pages that the hackers created, but which were surreptitiously encoded instructions to their malware.\u00a0 However, they also employed publicly available exploits and tools, including the following common vulnerabilities and exposures (\u201cCVE\u201d): \u00a0CVE-2019-19781, CVE-2019-11510, CVE-2019-16920, CVE-2019-16278, CVE-2019-1652/CVE-2019-1653, and CVE-2020-10189.\n\nThe second August 2020 indictment charged Wong Ong Hua, 46, and Ling Yang Ching, 32, both Malaysian nationals and residents, with 23 counts of racketeering, conspiracy, identity theft, aggravated identity theft, access device fraud, money laundering, violations of the CFAA, and falsely registering domain names.\u00a0 The indictment alleged that Wong and Ling conducted the affairs of Sea Gamer Mall, a Malaysian company founded by Wong, through a pattern of racketeering activity involving computer intrusion offenses targeting the video game industry in the United States, France, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea.\u00a0 The indictment alleged that Wong and Ling worked with various hackers, including Zhang and Tan, to profit from the hackers\u2019 criminal computer intrusions at video game companies.\n\nThe indictment against Zhang and Tan charges the defendants with two counts of conspiracy to commit computer fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; five counts of wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; nine counts of intentional damage to a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison; four counts of unauthorized access to a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; two counts of aggravated identity theft, which carries a mandatory sentence of two years in prison; and one count of money laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.\n\nThe indictment against Jiang, Qian, and Fu charges the defendants with one count of racketeering conspiracy, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of intentional damage to a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison; one count of unauthorized access to a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of threatening to damage a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of access device fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison; one count of identity theft, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of aggravated identity theft, which carries a mandatory sentence of two years in prison; and one count of money laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.\n\nThe indictment against Wong and Ling charges the defendants with one count of racketeering conspiracy, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; one count of racketeering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; three counts of intentional damage to a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison; five counts of unauthorized access to a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; five counts of furthering fraud by unauthorized access to a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; two counts of access device fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison; two counts of identity theft, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of aggravated identity theft, which carries a mandatory sentence of two years in prison; and three counts of money laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.\u00a0 The indictment also alleges false registration of domain names, which would increase the maximum sentence of imprisonment for money laundering to 27 years; the maximum sentence of imprisonment for unlawful access to a protected computer to 10 years instead of five years; the maximum sentence of imprisonment for intentional damage to a protected computer to 17 years instead of 10 years; and the mandatory sentence of imprisonment for aggravated identity theft to four years instead of two years.\n\nThe maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only; any sentencing's of the defendants will be determined by the assigned judge.\n\nThe investigation was conducted jointly by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia, the National Security Division of the Department of Justice, and the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office. \u00a0The FBI\u2019s Cyber Division assisted in the investigation and, along with FBI\u2019s Cyber Assistant Legal Attach\u00e9s and Legal Attach\u00e9s in countries around the world, provided essential support. \u00a0Numerous victims cooperated and provided valuable assistance in the investigation.\n\nThe department is also grateful to Microsoft, including Microsoft\u2019s Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) and Digital Crimes Unit (DCU), to Google, including its Threat Analysis Group (TAG), to Facebook, and to Verizon Media, including its Paranoids Advanced Cyber Threats Team, for the assistance they provided in this investigation.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Demian Ahn of the District of Columbia, Assistant U.S. Attorney Tejpal Chawla of the District of Columbia, and Trial Attorney Evan Turgeon of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting this case.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs provided critical assistance.\n\nThe details contained in the charging document are allegations. The defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.",

According to the criminal complaint, for several years he willfully took steps to obscure his affiliations and collaboration with a Chinese University and at least one Chinese-owned company.\u00a0 The terms of Cheng\u2019s grant prohibited participation, collaboration or coordination with China, any Chinese-owned company or any Chinese University, according to the charges.\n\n\u201cOnce again, we have witnessed the criminal consequences that can arise from undisclosed participation in the Chinese government\u2019s talent program,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers.\u00a0 \u201cProfessor Cheng allegedly made false statements to his university and to NASA regarding his affiliations with the Chinese government.\u00a0 The Department of Justice will continue seeking to bring participation in these talent programs to light and to expose the exploitation of our nation and our prized research institutions.\u201d\n\n\u201cChina is building an economy and academic institutions with bricks stolen from others all around the world,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Patrick for the Southern District of Texas. \u201cWhile 1.4 million foreign researchers and academics are here in the U.S. for the right reasons, the Chinese Talents Program exploits our open and free universities. These conflicts must be disclosed, and we will hold those accountable when such conflict violates the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs alleged,\u00a0Zhengdong Cheng knowingly deceived NASA officials about his association with Chinese owned companies and universities, willingly accepted U.S. government funding, and defrauded his university,\u201d said Assistant Director Alan Kohler, Jr. of the FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Division.\u00a0 \u201cThe FBI is committed\u00a0to aggressively pursuing those individuals who try and undercut our U.S. research institutions and government agencies by concealing their participation in Chinese talent recruitment programs and to hold them accountable for their actions.\u201d\n\n\u201cNASA\u2019s funding restrictions are in place to protect taxpayer-financed research dollars and intellectual property,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Mark Zielinski, NASA Office of Inspector General (OIG) - Eastern Field Office. \u00a0\u201cWe will continue pursue anyone who attempts to circumvent these guidelines and conceal affiliations with Chinese institutions and companies in order to obtain NASA grant money.\u201d\n\n\u201cDr. Cheng is accused of hiding his affiliation with the Guangdong University of Technology, along with other foreign universities, while disregarding the rules established under his NASA contract during his employment at TAMU,\u201d said FBI Houston Special Agent in Charge Perrye K. Turner. \u00a0\u201cThese alleged actions came to light through the tireless work of the FBI-Bryan Resident Agency and NASA-OIG investigative teams.\u00a0 We are grateful to TAMU, TAMU System and TAMU Engineering Experiment Station for providing significant assistance through their partnership with us throughout this case.\u201d\n\nThe charges allege Cheng and TAMU received funds based on Cheng knowingly providing false information to TAMU and consequently to NASA. \u00a0In addition to the funds, Cheng personally benefited from his affiliation with TAMU and NASA with increased access to unique NASA resources, such as the International Space Station, according to the complaint. \u00a0This access allegedly allowed Cheng to further his standing in China at Guangdong University of Technology and other universities. \u00a0The charges further allege he held senior research positions there unknown to TAMU and NASA and was able to serve in the People\u2019s Republic of China Talents program. \u00a0China\u2019s Talents Plans are allegedly designed to attract, recruit and cultivate high-level scientific talent in furtherance of China\u2019s scientific development, economic prosperity and national security.\n\nThe FBI-Bryan Resident Agency and NASA-Office of Inspector General conducted the investigation with the assistance of TAMU. \u00a0Assistant U.S. Attorneys Carolyn Ferko and S. Mark McIntyre are prosecuting the case with the assistance of trial attorney Matthew McKenzie of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.\n\nThe details contained in the charging documents are allegations. \u00a0The defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.",

            "article_text": "ATLANTA \u2013 Xiao-Jiang Li has pleaded guilty to a criminal information charging him with filing a false tax return and was sentenced by a U.S. District Judge on the same day.\u00a0 Dr. Li, a former Emory University professor and Chinese Thousand Talents Program participant, worked overseas at Chinese Universities and did not report any of his foreign income on his federal tax returns.\n\n\u201cThis defendant thought that he could live two, separate lives\u2014one here at Emory University and one in China as a Thousand Talents Program participant,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Byung J. \u201cBJay\u201d Pak. \u201cEventually, the truth caught up to this defendant, and he is now a convicted felon who is ordered to repay over $35,000 to the IRS.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Department of Justice remains vigilant over programs such as the Thousand Talents Program that recruits professors and researchers to work for China,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers. \u201cIn this case, Li was caught in his lack of transparency. We are grateful for the work our partners have done to bring light to this case.\u201d\n\n\u201cIRS Criminal Investigation is diligent when it comes to enforcing tax laws directed at those who attempt to defraud our nation\u2019s tax system,\" said James E. Dorsey, Special Agent in Charge of Atlanta Field Office. \u201cThis sentencing is an example that federal tax crimes will not go unpunished. Those consequences include being a convicted felon and paying back all the taxes owed including penalties and interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cLi's actions demonstrated a flagrant disrespect for the law and taxpayers,\u201d said Chris Hacker, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta. \u201cThe FBI and our federal partners will always pursue individuals like Li, who victimize innocent taxpayers for their own personal gain.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur watchdog agency will continue to aggressively investigate anyone who does not adhere to agency rules regarding the disclosure of foreign funding and affiliations,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Derrick L. Jackson, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General.\u00a0 \u201cWe will continue to work closely with our law enforcement partners to bring these types of cases to justice.\u201d\n\nAccording to U.S. Attorney Pak, the charges and other information presented in court: In late 2011, while employed at Emory University, Li joined the Thousand Talents Program, a Chinese-government talent recruitment initiative that targets professors and researchers to work in China. Starting in 2012 and continuing until 2018, Li, while still working at Emory University researching, among other things, the use of large animal models to investigate Huntington\u2019s disease, also worked at two Chinese universities\u2014first at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and then at Jinan University\u2014conducting similar large animal model research. Over those six years, Li earned at least $500,000 in foreign income that he never reported on his federal income tax returns.\n\nLi\u2019s false income tax returns came to light after the National Institutes of Health (\u201cNIH\u201d) reviewed Li\u2019s NIH research grant applications and became concerned that he had failed to disclose, among other things, foreign research activity. Those concerns prompted Emory University, and later, federal law enforcement, to investigate the matter, which revealed Li\u2019s false tax returns.\n\nXiao-Jiang Li, 63, of Atlanta, Georgia, pleaded guilty on May 8, 2020, and was sentenced to one year of probation and ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $35,089. He was also ordered to file lawful income tax returns for the years 2012 through 2018 within the first two months of his probation and fully cooperate with the Examination Division, Internal Revenue Service, in making a complete and accurate determination of all taxes, penalties, and interest that he owes.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Department of Health and Human Services OIG investigated this case.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Samir Kaushal and Department of Justice National Security Division Trial Attorney Matthew J. McKenzie prosecuted the case.\n\nFor further information please contact the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Public Affairs Office atUSAGAN.PressEmails@usdoj.govor (404) 581-6016.\u00a0 The Internet address for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Georgia ishttp://www.justice.gov/usao-ndga.",

            "article_text": "A civilian professor at the Air War College on Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama, pleaded guilty to making false statements to a federal agent.\n\nAccording to court documents, Xiaoming Zhang, 69, a naturalized citizen of Chinese descent living in Montgomery, Alabama, began working as an Air War College (AWC) professor in July 2003. During his tenure at the AWC, Zhang would travel to China on a regular basis for work-related purposes, research and to visit family living there.\n\nBeginning sometime in 2012, Zhang developed a relationship with a known foreign official working with the Shanghai Municipal Government. Records indicate that Zhang met with the official in person on approximately six occasions and exchanged approximately 40 emails with him from December 2012 to January 2017. At some point during this period, Zhang became aware that the official was using, or attempting to use, their relationship to gain access to sensitive information in Zhang\u2019s possession, as well as to make contact with other potentially valuable individuals.\n\nAs part of his employment at the AWC, Zhang held a \u201csecret\u201d security clearance and attended annual security training that informed him of reporting requirements about suspicious foreign contacts and relationships with foreign government officials, along with other briefings concerning reporting requirements. Despite all the trainings and briefings, Zhang failed to report the relationship with the foreign official even after he came to understand that the official was attempting to gather sensitive information from Zhang.\n\nAccording to the factual basis contained in the plea agreement, Zhang made multiple misleading or false statements to authorities in an attempt to hide his relationship with the Chinese official. In August of 2017, Zhang denied knowing the foreign official when questioned by U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigators who were verifying his continued eligibility for a security clearance. When the FBI interviewed Zhang in July of 2020, he initially made more false statements, but eventually admitted to meeting with the official in China on numerous occasions and to being untruthful concerning that information. Zhang also acknowledged that he had concealed the relationship with the official because he knew it was improper.\n\nZhang pleaded guilty to making false statements to a federal agent and faces a maximum of five years in prison at sentencing. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nActing Assistant Attorney General Mark J. Lesko of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division and Acting U.S. Attorney Sandra J. Stewart for the Middle District of Alabama made the announcement.\n\nThe FBI investigated the case, with valuable assistance provided by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, the Department of the Air Force\u2019s Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), and the Department of Defense.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Brett Talley of the Middle District of Alabama is prosecuting the case with assistance from Trial Attorney Scott Claffee of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.",

Fardon, United States Attorney\u00a0for the Northern District of Illinois, as prepared for delivery\u00a0at Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law's \"Opioids: An Interdisciplinary Symposium,\"\u00a0on October 20, 2016:\n\nThank you Professor Geraghty for that kind introduction, and thank you Northwestern for having me.\u00a0 It\u2019s great to be here.\u00a0 I\u2019m grateful that you\u2019re shining your light on this terrible epidemic.\n\nOpiate consumption is a full-on crisis in this country.\u00a0 It is nothing shy of an historic national public health and safety epidemic.\u00a0 Opioids are now killing more people in this country than gun violence.\u00a0 Opioids are now killing more people in this country than car crashes.\n\nHeroin is everywhere.\u00a0 It\u2019s in our cities, suburbs, schools and homes.\u00a0 The good old days of black tar heroin being expensive and hard to obtain, and ugly to use because it\u2019s intravenous \u2013 those days are long gone.\u00a0 Now powder heroin is cheap; it can be snorted or smoked; and in some neighborhoods, it\u2019s easier to find than a fresh head of lettuce.\n\nHeroin is rampant in Chicago.\u00a0 You can go buy some right now for $10 on the West Side just off the Eisenhower Expressway, now known to some as the \u201cHeroin Highway.\u201d\u00a0 And it\u2019s all too cheap and easy to find heroin now in our collar counties as well: DuPage County, Lake County, Kane County, Will County\u00a0and beyond.\n\nIn Chicago, about a person a day is dying right now from a heroin overdose.\u00a0 And about one additional person dies every day from an opioid other than heroin.\u00a0 In the collar counties, we\u2019re now seeing about one person every three days, dying from heroin or opioid overdose.\n\nHeroin is an equal-opportunity killer.\u00a0 It is killing men, women, Blacks, Whites, Hispanics, friends, neighbors, loved ones.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t discriminate; young and old, rich and poor, urban and rural, inner city and suburb.\n\nAccording to the CDC, between 2002 and 2013, the heroin death rate across the country nearly quadrupled \u2013 from 0.7 deaths per 10,000 people to 2.7 deaths per 10,000.\u00a0 During that same time frame, heroin use doubled among women, it increased 114% among whites, and it increased 109% among all 18-25 year olds.\n\nThe mean age of first use of heroin in this country is now 18 years old. \u00a0And heroin has one of the highest dependency liability profiles of any drug, licit or illicit.\u00a0 Only nicotine ranks higher.\u00a0 Of those who are offered heroin, about 20% will try it, and of those who do, 25% will become addicted.\n\nAnd for those who become dependent, the prognosis is not good; mortality rates for heroin addicts are extremely high.\u00a0 Over 50% of heroin addicts will be dead before the age of 50, with the average age of death being 30.\n\nIf all of that is not scary enough, here\u2019s the kicker \u2013 heroin isn\u2019t necessarily the biggest threat this crisis presents.\u00a0 Heroin now has an even more dangerous cousin on the streets: fentanyl.\u00a0 We are seeing an explosion right now, from a law enforcement perspective, in presence of fentanyl and fentanyl analogues.\n\nMany folks still don\u2019t know what fentanyl is. Fentanyl is made in a lab.\u00a0 Traditionally, it has been a very powerful prescription pain medication used for end of life situations or for those in extreme pain.\u00a0 But now, it\u2019s being cooked up in Mexican super labs run by drug cartels, and it\u2019s being manufactured in China and sold to those cartels, or otherwise smuggled into the U.S. for illicit use.\n\nDrug dealers are using fentanyl to dilute and increase the volume of the heroin they are selling on our streets. \u00a0While heroin is cheap, fentanyl is even cheaper, and so dealers are juicing their profits by mixing fentanyl into their heroin street products.\n\nAnd that means more people are dying.\u00a0 Fentanyl is 40 to 50 times stronger than heroin.\u00a0 Fentanyl is 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine.\u00a0 Fentanyl has the power to kill with the ingestion, inhalation or skin absorption of just two milligrams.\u00a0 By point of reference, that sweetener packet your kids play with at the restaurant table \u2013 that contains 1,000 milligrams per packet.\u00a0 Two milligrams of fentanyl can be lethal.\n\nFentanyl-laced heroin is increasingly killing people in our area.\u00a0 Cook County has seen at least 124 fentanyl-related deaths since January 2015. \u00a0Many drug users don\u2019t even know that heroin they are using may be laced with fentanyl.\u00a0 They don\u2019t know until it\u2019s too late.\n\nAnd because of its potency, fentanyl poses an unwitting risk not only to those heroin users but also to first responders.\u00a0 For cops or agents who are seizing dope or searching a crime scene and unwittingly touch or inhale powder fentanyl, their lives are also at stake.\n\nAnd fentanyl has analogues.\u00a0 We\u2019ve recently seen one called carfentanil \u2013 an analogue literally used in zoos to tranquilize elephants.\u00a0 An elephant tranquilizer.\u00a0 Carfentanil is roughly 100 times stronger than common fentanyl.\u00a0 I mentioned that\u00a0two milligrams of fentanyl is enough to kill a person.\u00a0 Well, that same\u00a0two milligrams of carfentanil is enough to knock out a 2,000-pound African elephant.\n\nSo it\u2019s no surprise then that carfentanil-laced heroin is a killer.\u00a0 Last month, it was responsible for at least 8 overdose deaths in the Cincinnati, Ohio, area.\u00a0 And unfortunately I can tell you that\u00a0carfentanil is not limited to Ohio and points east.\u00a0 It is right here in Chicago.\u00a0 Right now.\n\nAnother similar analogue that has popped up recently is called W-18, which like carfentanil is 10,000 times more powerful than morphine.\u00a0 Earlier this month, the Will County Coroner confirmed that a man who died from an overdose in April of this year had W-18 in his system.\n\nFentanyl and its analogues are finding their way into heroin powder.\u00a0 By itself, that is frightening.\u00a0 But here\u2019s more: we are now seeing a swell of illicit counterfeit pills containing fentanyl.\u00a0 Hundreds of thousands of counterfeit prescription pills \u2013 pills made to look like oxycodone or hydrocodone but containing fentanyl -- are now being trafficked in the U.S. \u00a0Some of these counterfeit pills are manufactured outside the U.S. and smuggled in, principally through Mexico and Canada. But we also now are finding clandestine pill operations domestically.\n\nJust two weeks ago, the Wall Street Journal ran a front page story about how two people in San Francisco were charged this summer with manufacturing fentanyl-laced pills.\u00a0 The pills were made to look like oxycodone but actually contained fentanyl.\u00a0 During a search of a San Francisco home, the DEA found fentanyl powder, mixing equipment, and a $1,000 pill press.\n\nOn the other coast, in January of this year, DEA, after making undercover purchases of about 6,000 counterfeit pills, arrested a counterfeiter in New York.\u00a0 Again, the pills were made to look like 30 milligram oxycodone pills but contained fentanyl.\u00a0 Just like the couple in San Francisco, this counterfeiter in New York was making those pills in his home.\n\nAnd there\u2019s a reason we\u2019re seeing more and more of that.\u00a0 It\u2019s called profit.\u00a0 The pill presses are easy to acquire and are fairly cheap.\u00a0 And you can purchase a kilo of fentanyl powder from China for a few thousand dollars.\u00a0 That kilo, plus the press, can generate millions in quick profit.\n\nLet\u2019s say you make a batch at 1.5 milligrams of fentanyl per pill.\u00a0 Then one kilo can generate about 666,666 counterfeit pills.\u00a0 According to DEA, counterfeit pills containing fentanyl are now retailing between $10 and $20 per pill.\u00a0 That means between $6.5 and $13 million in sales from pills made for a few thousand bucks.\u00a0 That is a serious problem.\n\nAnd these counterfeit pills closely resemble the authentic medications. The presence of fentanyl is often only detected through laboratory analysis. \u00a0The people taking these pills may have no idea that the pill contains a potentially deadly substance.\u00a0 They may not know until it\u2019s too late.\n\nThat is a dire diagnosis.\u00a0 And I\u2019m sorry for the parade of horribles to begin this speech, but I think it\u2019s important that we be honest about the nature and scope of the problem before discussing solutions.\n\nLet me talk now about some of the things we are doing federally to push back against this epidemic.\u00a0 And I\u2019ll start with criminal enforcement, but first let me make this clear up front: while our primary function at the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office is to investigate and prosecute crimes, criminal enforcement alone cannot solve, and will never solve this crisis.\u00a0 Treatment and prevention are equally if not more important ingredients to any solution.\u00a0 This crisis demands a coordinated response across all elements of government and society.\u00a0 After I talk about criminal enforcement, I\u2019ll offer some thoughts and ideas, from my Office\u2019s perspective, about treatment and prevention.\n\nEnforcement\n\nFirst, enforcement.\u00a0 Under the leadership of the Drug Enforcement Administration, the FBI, and other federal, state and local law enforcement partners, we are working harder than ever right now to attack the illicit opioids supply chain.\n\nThe vast majority of heroin that\u2019s flooding our Chicago region is brought here by international drug cartels and specifically Mexican-based cartels like the Sinaloa Cartel, the Juarez Cartel, the New Generation Cartel, the Zetas and others.\u00a0 While it is impossible to know exactly how much heroin the cartels are smuggling into the Chicago area, based on recent seizure and source information, I think it\u2019s safe to say that thousands of kilograms are now being imported here every year.\n\nWhy is the heroin problem particularly acute in Chicago?\u00a0 Because we are a transshipment hub for cartels; because our location and transportation networks - air, rail and road \u2013 make Chicago an ideal transshipment point.\u00a0 So we have a profound supply problem, and of course that eases distribution to street gangs that plague so many of our communities.\n\nSo we are committing more and more federal resources here to investigating and prosecuting suppliers - heroin traffickers from the cartel leaders to the street gangs.\u00a0 Between 2005 and 2014, the number of heroin-related arrests by DEA surged more than 200 percent.\u00a0 2014 was the first year ever that DEA arrested more defendants for heroin trafficking than cocaine.\u00a0 And that trajectory has only escalated since then.\u00a0 DEA Chicago has proclaimed combatting heroin and opioid crime its number 1 priority for our district.\n\nAt the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, I\u2019ve instructed all of our prosecutors who work narcotics cases that investigating heroin and opioid trafficking is now our number one narcotics enforcement priority.\u00a0 As little as three years ago, the majority of new case initiations in our office involved cocaine trafficking.\u00a0 Since the beginning of this year, over 75% of the major narcotics investigations we\u2019ve logged in at the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office are heroin, fentanyl or other illicit opioid trafficking cases.\n\nOne recent example is Operation Over the Top.\u00a0 In the spring of this year, DEA agents, working with Assistant U.S. Attorneys in my office, identified a heroin trafficking organization that was responsible for transporting, in the hollowed out axles of tractor-trucks, 20-30 kilograms of heroin every week into the Chicago area.\u00a0 We made multiple seizures resulting in the recovery of almost 100 kilos of heroin.\u00a0 Until we made those seizures and stopped this particular distribution line, this group had been smuggling all of this heroin into our city for at least two years.\u00a0 And that\u2019s just one organization and one investigation.\u00a0 We have many more charged and in the investigative pipeline.\n\nLast year, in an Operation titled G.I. Joe, DEA agents and the Chicago Police Department took down what may have been the largest open-air heroin market in Chicago history, at Grenshaw and Independence on the West Side.\u00a0 CPD and DEA made over 70 undercover purchases of heroin from gang members operating the drug spot, and seized over\u00a0two kilos of heroin.\u00a0 Before we took it down, conservative estimates based on the volume of customer traffic indicate heroin sales were in excess of $2.6 million per year at that spot alone.\n\nSo we\u2019re going after the gangs and drug trafficking organizations that are moving heroin into our communities.\u00a0 We\u2019re also committing significant resources to going after the cartels bringing the dope here in the first instance.\n\nI hope most of you have heard something about the Sinaloa Cartel prosecutions we have brought recently in my Office.\u00a0 The Sinaloa Cartel is perhaps the single biggest transnational criminal organization in the world, responsible for the distribution of hundreds of tons of illegal drugs, including heroin, to virtually every corner of the world.\u00a0 Because Sinaloa has decided to use Chicago as one of its principal transshipment points in the United States, my office together with our law enforcement partners, have targeted the cartel with every resource and tool at our disposal.\n\nAnd we have been successful.\u00a0 We have brought indictments against all levels of the cartel and its infrastructure \u2013 from the cartel\u2019s command and control based in Mexico, to its Chicago-based distribution cells, and all the way down to the street gangs who push the cartel\u2019s dope onto the streets of Chicago and the surrounding communities. \u00a0We\u2019ve indicted over 70 individuals, including Sinaloa leader Chapo Guzman, his sons and a slew of the other highest-ranking Sinaloa members in Mexico and here in Chicago. \u00a0\u00a0Of those, we have convicted all but 18, and among the rest some are awaiting trial and others are fugitives from justice, including some now in custody awaiting extradition from Mexico.\u00a0 And we have seized over\u00a0eleven tons of Sinaloa cocaine, 80 kilograms of heroin, and $30 million in cartel assets \u2013 the lifeblood of their organization.\u00a0 Because Sinaloa is the number 1 importer of heroin into our district, we have, and will continue to, take the fight directly to them.\n\nOur fentanyl enforcement activities here in Chicago are also a focus of my Office right now.\u00a0 We are working closely and constantly with our partners to track and prosecute fentanyl distributors.\u00a0 About a month ago, we joined the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, DEA, CPD and others, to announce new charges against more than 30 defendants for distributing fentanyl and heroin on the West Side of Chicago.\n\nIn addition to cartels and gangs and fentanyl, we\u2019re also focused federally on diversion \u2013 which is a different kind of supply-side problem.\u00a0 Abuse of prescription medications like hydrocodone and oxycodone are a gateway to heroin use.\u00a0 According to the CDC, 45% of people who use heroin are also addicted to prescription painkillers. \u00a0And nearly 80% of new heroin users previously used prescription medications.\u00a0 Just last month, HHS released new stats showing that at least 3.8 million Americans age 12 years and older are misusing prescription medications.\u00a0 That is, sadly, our future heroin and fentanyl overdose population.\n\nTo beat the heroin and fentanyl problem, we have to stem the tide of prescription medications diverted for unlawful use.\u00a0 To that end, my office and DEA are ramping up our investigations of doctors, pharmacists, and pharmacy employees who illegally prescribe and dispense hydrocodone and oxycodone. \u00a0To give one recent example, at the end of last year, we brought federal charges against a doctor in Lockport, Illinois, who wrote an astounding 500-plus prescriptions to one person for both oxycodone and Adderall.\u00a0 From these prescriptions, 37,000 oxy and Adderall pills were illegally diverted from their intended pharmaceutical use to those who suffer from opioid addiction.\n\nBecause research shows that abuse of prescription opioids is a gateway to heroin use, it is vital that law enforcement identify and prosecute those in the medical field who abuse their oath by illegally diverting opioids for their own financial gain. \u00a0That\u2019s another important piece of our long-term strategy for success.\n\nTreatment\n\nSo those are some of the things we\u2019re doing on the enforcement front.\u00a0 Let me say a few words about treatment.\u00a0 Enforcement is all about supply side.\u00a0 Treatment flips the script; it\u2019s about demand.\n\nCartels wouldn\u2019t be importing heroin into our district if there wasn\u2019t a market. \u00a0The hard truth is that demand for heroin in our district appears to be at an all-time high.\n\nAccording to an August 2015 study, admissions for heroin treatment in Illinois are significantly higher than the nation as a whole.\u00a0 Nationally, heroin-treatment admissions comprise about 16% of total state-funded treatment admissions, whereas in Illinois, heroin caused about 25% of all such treatment admissions.\u00a0 Heroin is now the second most common reason for citizens in our state to enter state-funded treatment programs, only behind alcohol addiction.\n\nAnd the growing heroin addiction problem is not just an adult problem.\u00a0 It\u2019s now affecting our kids, and that situation is rapidly getting worse.\u00a0 In 2013, 3.8% of Illinois youth reported using heroin in the past year.\u00a0 3.8% of all kids in this state said \u2018yes, I\u2019ve used heroin within the last year.\u2019\u00a0 That is a disturbing reality and trend.\n\nSo, with this seemingly endless flow of heroin into our area, what can we in law enforcement do about demand and addiction?\u00a0 Here are a few quick thoughts and ideas.\n\nFirst, from a criminal justice perspective, we have to make sure we are separating users and addicts from traffickers and profiteers.\u00a0 When we catch users in the act, or with heroin in their pocket, and we arrest and incarcerate that user without any attention to the underlying problem, we\u2019ve not only ignored the problem, we\u2019ve made it worse.\u00a0 Those addicts, without help, will use again upon release (if not while in jail).\u00a0 And meanwhile we are straining our jails and our budgets by locking up people who are sick and no risk to society.\n\nThis issue is principally a state and local justice systems issue.\u00a0 And across the state, I have seen many courts and prosecutors' offices recognize this dilemma and respond to it.\u00a0 In Cook, DuPage, Lake, Kane, McHenry Counties and others, there are now drug courts and diversion programs designed to separate drug users from other defendants and put those users on a pathway not of incarceration but of treatment and rehabilitation.\u00a0 Those efforts are laudable, and critical. \u00a0And while a lot has been done on that front, we do need to make sure those kinds of efforts are being duplicated across our local justice systems, including in rural areas.\n\nOne great example is the partnership between the Chicago High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, or HIDTA, and the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, where they have established a program under which individuals caught distributing heroin or other drugs but who themselves are substance abusers or addicts and have minor, non-violent criminal histories, those individuals are immediately evaluated by addiction treatment professionals and given the option of entering treatment.\u00a0 If the addict decides to avail himself of the treatment opportunity, then the arrest for distribution is dismissed.\u00a0 This is the type of forward-thinking approach to addiction and treatment that can make a real difference.\n\nMore broadly, inside and outside of our justice systems, we have to do a better job of providing addiction treatment for those who are in the throes of abuse.\u00a0 Whether public, private or philanthropic, we need to stretch and find ways to fund treatment for those who don\u2019t have insurance or otherwise can\u2019t afford it.\u00a0 While I realize that presents enormous challenges - and I also realize that I may be swimming outside my lane - the truth is that the alternative won\u2019t work.\u00a0 If we don\u2019t improve treatment, we will pay more in the end \u2013 more in connection with medical emergency responses to increasing overdoses, more through enforcement, arrests, and incarceration, and more as measured by lives lost.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0So, however we do it, we have to improve our game statewide on the treatment front.\n\nAs a component of that, we need to make sure our educators and community leaders understand the nature of opioid addiction and are prepared to help those who are opioid dependent.\u00a0 Rather than responding to someone\u2019s heroin or opioid abuse as a crime, we need folks to respond to it as a threshold matter for what it is: an illness that requires medical treatment and a pathway to rehabilitation.\n\nLastly on the treatment front, I\u2019d like to make a related but different point.\u00a0 I want to make a strong plug for the continued proliferation, particularly to our first responders, including fireman and patrol officers, of naloxone, most commonly referred to by the brand name Narcan.\u00a0 Narcan is an easy-to-use, lifesaving antidote for heroin and opioid overdoses.\u00a0 Used in hospitals for decades, the medication has no abuse potential, is not that expensive, and is easy to administer.\u00a0 Well over a hundred lives in the Chicagoland area have been saved already this year by use of Narcan, and that number will only increase as the heroin crisis continues.\n\nI have heard some concerns and criticism that naloxone emboldens addicts to push their limits.\u00a0 If they believe they can be brought back from overdose, then the risk/reward analysis of that higher dosage arguably can change.\u00a0 I get that.\u00a0 But I also know that people are dying right now.\u00a0 And with the increased presence of fentanyl, more of those overdoses than ever are unexpected.\u00a0 So, for now, I don\u2019t think we as a society have a next best responsible choice.\u00a0 We need to embrace training and investment in naloxone as a way to save lives.\u00a0\u00a0 We have to keep spreading the word and making those investments.\n\nPrevention\n\nSo that\u2019s enforcement and treatment.\u00a0 Let me, as promised, say something briefly about prevention.\u00a0 I start from this base point: as I said earlier, we have to be honest and recognize that prosecutions alone will not solve this problem.\u00a0 Until we stem demand, the supply chain will continue to fight and find a way.\u00a0 So we have to get every bit as aggressive about education and prevention as we are already about enforcement.\n\nOne of the great attributes of this conference today is that it has brought together professionals from so many different disciplines that touch on this crisis.\u00a0 It is not every day that lawyers, doctors, economists, and law enforcement are all together under the same roof talking about the same problem.\u00a0 And having you all here together gives me the opportunity to mention a phenomenon that I worry contributes significantly to the heroin and opioid problem in this country.\u00a0 And that is the over-prescription of pain medications.\n\nI have attended too many events where I hear the same story told, over and over.\u00a0 How a teenager or young adult playing sports is injured and goes to a doctor for treatment, receives a multi-week course of prescription opioid pain medications, and even though he or she may not need all of those meds to manage the pain, they take them and become dependent, leading to a crippling downward spiral of abuse that eventually leads to heroin.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve heard about parents who received a large prescription for pain medications after a surgery and took some, but nowhere near all, of those pills.\u00a0 And the pills then sat forgotten in the medicine cabinet, until one day they were found by a teenager living in the house.\u00a0 And so the downward spiral begins.\n\nThese stories, which are real and are happening every day across this country, give color to the sobering statistic that the United States, with roughly 5% of the world\u2019s population, consumes more than 75% of the world\u2019s prescription drugs.\u00a0 There is something wrong there.\n\nWhen I say I love doctors, it\u2019s literal.\u00a0 I am the son of an orthopedic surgeon.\u00a0 I know that the issue of prescribing pain medications is a difficult and complex balance.\u00a0 And I also know that the lions\u2019 share of doctors work hard every day, patient by patient, to get that balance right.\n\nBut the system as a whole is not working; 75% consumption of the world\u2019s opioids reflects a problem, an imbalance in our health care system in this country.\u00a0 And so I ask our physicians and health care providers to work even harder to come up with ideas and solutions for the underlying issue of over-prescription.\u00a0 It\u2019s imperative that you stretch.\u00a0 It\u2019s imperative that we all stretch.\n\nEvery one of us has to do more and do better at teaching our citizens and kids that pain medications can begin dependency that can lead to downward spiral into heroin use and death.\u00a0 We have to be open and honest about how common opioid addiction is in this country, about the stark realities of that downward spiral, about the ravages heroin reeks on the body, and the devastation it brings on an addict\u2019s friends and family.\n\nEveryone has to own this.\u00a0 We need to leverage every medium we can think of \u2013 from print to TV to internet and social media.\u00a0 We need to talk and educate in our schools, our churches, our businesses, and our community organizations.\u00a0 And maybe most importantly, we need to talk in our homes.\u00a0 No parent can any longer afford to wait and hope the opportunity to try heroin never finds your kid.\u00a0 It will.\u00a0 So let\u2019s talk to our kids about it now, so they will be ready when that day soon comes.\n\nAnd maybe most fundamentally, it\u2019s time to de-stigmatize heroin addiction.\u00a0 For decades, heroin was linked in our public consciousness with dirty needles, dark alleys, and perforated forearms.\u00a0 That\u2019s no longer our reality.\u00a0 Heroin and opioid abuse is all around us.\u00a0 It\u2019s in our poorest communities and our wealthiest enclaves.\u00a0 It no longer knows socioeconomic bounds.\u00a0 It\u2019s happening under city bridges, and at suburban high school proms.\n\nHeroin is not a rich or poor issue, not a black or white issue, it\u2019s not a man or woman issue.\u00a0 It\u2019s a human issue.\u00a0 So let\u2019s lift the shadows.\u00a0 No more hushed silence and whispering in shame.\u00a0 This not shameful.\u00a0 It\u2019s tragic.\u00a0 We are all impacted, and we all are in this together.\n\nToday\u2019s event is an important step.\u00a0 We at the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office look forward to continuing this discussion and working with each and all of you until we reach a solution.\u00a0 Thanks for having me and for listening.",

            "article_text": "DALLAS\u2014 An 11-count indictment has been unsealed today against USPlabs LLC, a Dallas firm that formerly manufactured highly popular workout and weight loss supplements.\u00a0 The indictment charges USPlabs, S.K. Laboratories Inc. and their operators with a variety of charges related to the sale of those products.\u00a0 The announcement was made today at a news conference in Washington, D.C. in which officials announced a nationwide sweep of dietary supplement makers and marketers.\n\nJacobo Geissler, 39, of University Park, Texas, the CEO of\u00a0USPlabs; Jonathan Doyle, 37, of Dallas, the president of\u00a0USPlabs; Matthew Hebert, 37, of Dallas, responsible for product packaging design at USPlabs; Kenneth Miles, 69, of Panama City, Florida, the quality assurance executive in charge of compliance at USPlabs; S.K. Laboratories, Inc.; Sitesh Patel, 32, of Irvine, California, the vice president of\u00a0S.K. Laboratories; and Cyril Willson, 34, of Gretna, Nebraska, a consultant to USPlabs, are charged with various counts associated with the unlawful sale of dietary supplements. Additionally, USPlabs, Geissler, Doyle and Hebert are charged with obstruction of a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proceeding and conspiracy to commit money laundering.\n\nAll defendants, with the exception of Doyle and Miles were arrested earlier today.\u00a0 Along with the arrests, FDA and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Criminal Investigation (CI) special agents seized assets in dozens of investment accounts, real estate in Dallas County, and a number of luxury and sports cars.\n\nThe indictment alleges that USPlabs engaged in a conspiracy to import ingredients from China using false certificates of analysis and false labeling and then lied about the source and nature of those ingredients after it put them in its products.\u00a0 According to the indictment, USPlabs told some of its retailers and wholesalers that it used natural plant extracts in products called Jack3d and OxyElite Pro, when in fact it was using a synthetic stimulant manufactured in a Chinese chemical factory.\n\nThe indictment also alleges that the defendants sold some of their products without determining whether they would be safe to use.\u00a0 To the contrary, as the indictment notes, the defendants knew of studies that linked the products to liver toxicity.\n\nThe indictment further alleges that USPlabs and its principals told FDA in October 2013 that it would stop distribution of OxyElite Pro, once the product had been implicated in an outbreak of liver injuries.\u00a0 The indictment alleges that, despite this promise, USPlabs engaged in a surreptitious, all-hands-on-deck effort to sell as much OxyElite Pro as it could as quickly as possible. It was sold at dietary supplement stores across the nation.\n\nAn indictment is an accusation by a federal grand jury, and a defendant is entitled to the presumption of innocence unless proven guilty.\n\nUpon conviction, however, the maximum statutory penalties are: conspiracy to commit wire fraud and each wire fraud count \u2013 20 years and a $250,000 fine; conspiracy to commit money laundering \u2013 20 years and a $500,000 fine, or twice the value of property involved in the transaction; obstruction of an agency proceeding and conspiracy to introduce misbranded food \u2013 five years and a $250,000 fine; introduction of adulterated food into interstate commerce with an intent to defraud and mislead \u2013 three years and a $10,000 fine; and introduction of misbranded food into interstate commerce and the introduction of adulterated dietary supplement into interstate commerce \u2013 one year and a $10,000 fine.\n\nThe FDA and IRS CI investigated the case.\u00a0 Assistant U.S. Attorneys Errin Martin and P. J. Meitl of the Northern District of Texas and Trial Attorneys David Sullivan and Patrick Runkle of the Justice Department\u2019s Consumer Protection Branch are in charge of the prosecution.\n\n# # #",

            "article_text": "Damian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Matthew G. Olsen, the Assistant Attorney General for National Security, and Christie M. Curtis, the Acting Assistant Director in Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d), announced today the unsealing of an eight-count Indictment charging GAL LUFT with offenses related to willfully failing to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (\u201cFARA\u201d), arms trafficking, Iranian sanctions violations, and making false statements to federal agents.\u00a0 LUFT, a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen, was indicted on November 1, 2022, and arrested on February 17, 2023, in the Republic of Cyprus based on the charges in the Indictment.\u00a0 LUFT subsequently fled after being released on bail while extradition proceedings were pending and remains a fugitive.\n\nU.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: \u201cAs alleged, Gal Luft, a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen and co-head of a Maryland think tank, engaged in multiple, serious criminal schemes.\u00a0 He subverted foreign agent registration laws in the United States to seek to promote Chinese policies by acting through a former high-ranking U.S. Government official; he acted as a broker in deals for dangerous weapons and Iranian oil; and he told multiple lies about his crimes to law enforcement.\u00a0 As the charges unsealed today reflect, our Office will continue to work vigorously with our law enforcement partners to detect and hold accountable those who surreptitiously attempt to perpetrate malign foreign influence campaigns here in the United States.\u201d\n\nFBI Acting Assistant Director in Charge Christie M. Curtis said: \u201cAs alleged, the defendant engaged in multiple schemes to evade sanctions and laws intended to protect our national security. \u00a0 The FBI is determined to defend our nation by enforcing laws designed to promote transparency of foreign influence within the United States.\u201d\n\nAccording to the allegations contained in the Indictment, other filings, public information, and statements made during court proceedings:[1]\n\nFor years, LUFT, a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen who serves as the co-director of a Maryland-based think tank, engaged, along with others, in multiple international criminal schemes.\n\nFirst, LUFT conspired with others in an effort to act within the United States to advance the interests of the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cChina\u201d) as agents of China-based principals, without registering as foreign agents as required under U.S. law.\u00a0 As part of this scheme, while serving as the co-director of a Maryland-based non-profit think tank, LUFT agreed to covertly recruit and pay, on behalf of principals based in China, a former high-ranking U.S. Government official (\u201cIndividual-1\u201d), including in 2016 while the former official was an adviser to the then-President-elect, to publicly support certain policies with respect to China without LUFT or Individual-1 filing a registration statement as an agent of a foreign principal with the Attorney General of the United States, in violation of FARA.\u00a0 Among other things, in the weeks before the 2016 U.S. presidential election, LUFT and a co-conspirator (\u201cCC-1\u201d), who is a Chinese national and worked for a Chinese nongovernmental organization affiliated with a Chinese energy company, created a written \u201cdialogue\u201d between CC-1 and Individual-1, in which LUFT wrote Individual-1\u2019s responses and included information that was favorable to China.\u00a0 The dialogue was then published in a Chinese newspaper online and sent to, among others, individuals in the United States, including a journalist and professors at multiple U.S. universities.\u00a0 When LUFT was writing the dialogue, CC-1 told LUFT that \u201c[i]n these articles, we do not want to spill all the beans yet, just enough to let \u2018people\u2019 know he [i.e., Individual-1] is in the corridor of power to be.\u00a0 Just broad stroke policy consideration that leaves plenty of room for interpretation and imagination to be filled in later.\u201d\u00a0 After the purported \u201cconversations\u201d were published, LUFT told CC-1 that certain information, favorable to China, had been \u201ctucked between the lines.\u201d\u00a0 Shortly after the 2016 election, LUFT and CC-1 also discussed possible roles Individual-1 might have in the incoming U.S. administration and discussed Individual-1 taking a \u201csilent trip\u201d to China.\u00a0 LUFT responded that \u201c[w]e are debating about his role in the new admin.\u00a0 There are all kinds of considerations . . .We should talk ftf [i.e., face-to-face] as there can be a supremely unique opportunity for china.\u201d\n\nSecond, LUFT conspired with others and attempted to broker illicit arms transactions with, among others, certain Chinese individuals and entities.\u00a0 In his role as a broker or middleman, LUFT worked to find both buyers and sellers of certain weapons and other materials, without a license to do so as required under U.S. law, in violation of the Arms Export Control Act.\u00a0 Among other things, LUFT worked to broker a deal for Chinese companies to sell certain weapons to Libya, including anti-tank launchers, grenade launchers, and mortar rounds (which LUFT and his associates referred to in coded language as \u201ctoys\u201d).\u00a0 LUFT also worked to broker deals for certain weapons to be sold to the United Arab Emirates, including aerial bombs and rockets.\u00a0 LUFT further worked to broker deals for certain weapons to be sold by a Chinese company to Kenya, including unmanned aerial vehicles (\u201cUAVs\u201d) \u2013 and specifically \u201cstrike\u201d UAVs, which LUFT acknowledged \u201c[t]he US doesn\u2019t want to sell[, . . .] hence the opportunity.\u201d\u00a0 LUFT also discussed brokering a deal for weapons to Qatar and told CC-1 that Israel was \u201cnot a good fit\u201d as the middleman for the deal because it had the \u201c[s]ame problem the [] Q [i.e., Qataris] have w uncle [i.e., the United States].\u00a0 Need a third party.\u00a0 . . .\u00a0 I will activate.\u201d\u00a0 In his role as a broker for illicit arms deals, LUFT worked on a commission basis and traveled to meetings and received and passed on documentation needed to secure the deals.\u00a0 During a voluntary interview with U.S. law enforcement in which he was asked questions about his involvement in arms trafficking, LUFT made multiple false statements, including that he had not sought to engage in or profit from arms deals.\n\nThird, LUFT conspired with others and attempted to broker deals for Iranian oil \u2013 which he directed an associate to refer to as \u201cBrazilian\u201d oil in an effort to conceal the activity and evade sanctions \u2013 in violation of U.S. sanctions against Iran and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\u00a0 In his role as a broker or middleman, LUFT solicited buyers and passed on pricing and other information.\u00a0 One offer letter for Iranian oil that LUFT received noted that the \u201corigin\u201d of the oil was \u201cIranian / It can be presented as UAE origin without Iranian papers.\u201d\u00a0 He also assisted in setting up meetings between Iranian representatives and a Chinese energy company for the purpose of discussing oil deals.\u00a0 During a voluntary interview with U.S. law enforcement in which he was asked about his role brokering deals in Iranian oil, LUFT made multiple false statements, including that he had tried to prevent oil deals with Iran and had not been present during meetings with the Chinese energy company and Iranians.\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0

fugitive, has been charged with the following offenses, which carry the maximum prison terms listed below.\u00a0 The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by a judge.\n\nCount\n\nCharge\n\nMaximum Prison Term\n\nOne\n\nConspiracy to violate the Foreign Agents

\u2013 Criminal Investigation, the Department of Justice\u2019s National Security Division, and the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of International Affairs for their assistance.\n\nIf you have any information about LUFT\u2019s whereabouts, please contact your local FBI office or the nearest American Embassy or Consulate.\u00a0 Tips can be reported anonymously and can also be reported online at tips.fbi.gov.\n\nThis matter is being handled by the Office\u2019s National Security and International Narcotics Unit.\u00a0 Assistant U.S. Attorneys Daniel C. Richenthal and Catherine Ghosh are in charge of the prosecution, with assistance from Trial Attorney Scott Claffee of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.\n\nThe charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\n\n[1]As the introductory phrase signifies, the Indictment and the description of the Indictment set forth herein constitute only allegations, and every fact described should be treated as an allegation.",

            "article_text": "Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch recognized 279 department employees for their distinguished public service today at the 63ndAnnual Attorney General\u2019s Awards Ceremony.\u00a0 Thirty-three other individuals outside of the department were also honored for their work.\u00a0 This annual ceremony recognizes individuals for their outstanding service and dedication to carrying out the missions of the Department of Justice.\u00a0 The department will also present one posthumous award in honor of Deputy U.S. Marshal Josie Wells for his exceptional heroism in the line of duty.\n\n\u201cThe individuals being honored today stand out within a department that holds all of its employees and partners to an extremely high standard of excellence,\u201d said Attorney General Lynch.\u00a0 \u201cThey have put in long hours, made immense sacrifices and, in some cases, placed themselves in harm\u2019s way.\u00a0 They have taken on issues that once seemed intractable, and made progress on problems that once seemed impossible.\u00a0 And their outstanding work is an inspiration to public servants everywhere.\u201d\n\nTheAttorney General\u2019s Award for Exceptional Serviceis the department\u2019s highest award for employee performance and this year\u2019s award was presented to the team responsible for the thorough investigation of the Ferguson, Missouri, Police Department.\n\nOn Aug. 9, 2014, Ferguson Police Department Officer Darren Wilson shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown.\u00a0 The shooting immediately drew worldwide scrutiny, spawned weeks of unrest that resulted in the declaration of a state of emergency in Ferguson and the mobilization of the National Guard, which threatened to devolve into large-scale civil unrest.\u00a0 Simultaneously, the case and aftermath spawned a national debate on the nature of the roles of race and class in policing.\u00a0 Immediately following the shooting, the department\u2019s Civil Rights Division began criminal and civil investigations to uncover and analyze the facts surrounding the shooting and the broader practices of the Ferguson Police Department.\u00a0 These reports were widely read, were published in the most prominent news sources around the world and were received as credible by community members and law enforcement alike.\u00a0 The work of the recipients not only calmed the community, it set the framework for a groundbreaking project to improve police practices and police and community relations, while also reinforcing the credibility of the department by enforcing the civil rights of all Americans.\n\nThe recipients of theAttorney General\u2019s Award for Exceptional Serviceinclude, from the Office of the Attorney General, CounselorBenjamin C. Mizer, who is now the Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the department\u2019s Civil Division; from the Office of the Associate Attorney General, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney GeneralMolly J.

Iverson.\n\nTheAttorney General\u2019s Award for Exceptional Heroismis given to recognize an extraordinary act of courage and voluntary risk of life during the performance of official duties.\n\nThe recipients of theAttorney General\u2019s Award for Exceptional Heroismare, from the U.S. Marshals Service-Southern District of Mississippi, Deputy U.S. Marshal (DUSM)Josie Wells, and from the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s Washington, D.C., Field Division, Special Agent (SA)Mark T. Simala.\n\nOn March 10, 2015, the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS)-Middle District of Louisiana was involved in a significant incident in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, while attempting to arrest fugitive Jamie Croom during Operation Violence Reduction.\u00a0 Croom was wanted on two counts of first degree murder and violation of his federal supervised release.\u00a0 USMS personnel and Task Force Officers (TFO) responded to the Elm Grove Gardens Hotel in Baton Rouge in an attempt to arrest Croom.\u00a0 Dressed in tactical attire with clearly marked law enforcement insignias, the entry team knocked and announced their presence when opening the door. \u00a0Law enforcement personnel proceeded into the room, at which time DUSM Wells was struck by gun fire initiated by Croom, who was hiding behind the hotel room door.\u00a0 Law enforcement personnel immediately returned fire at the threat, striking Croom and subsequently restraining him.\u00a0 Task force personnel immediately extracted DUSM Wells from the room to the parking lot and attempted to render first aid.\u00a0 DUSM Wells was placed in a TFO\u2019s vehicle and transported to Lane Regional Medical Center in Zachary, Louisiana, where he was pronounced dead upon arrival.\n\nOn Nov. 19, 2014, SA Simala came to the aid of John Robert Phillips after he was involved in a horrific vehicle accident.\u00a0 With complete disregard for his own personal safety, SA Simala was able to rescue an unconscious Phillips from his burning vehicle shortly before it became engulfed by flames.\u00a0 Had SA Simala not acted, Phillips undoubtedly would have perished inside his burning vehicle.\u00a0 During the incident, SA Simala suffered burns to his outer clothing, smoke inhalation and had several small and treatable glass cuts to his right hand.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Phillips is said to be doing well and recovering from a shattered pelvis and two broken legs.\n\nTheEdward H. Levi Award for Outstanding Professionalism and Exemplary Integrityis presented to pay tribute to the memory and achievements of former Attorney General Edward H. Levi, whose career as an attorney, law professor, dean and public servant exemplified these qualities in the best traditions of the department.\u00a0 This year\u2019s award is presented toCharles E. Samuels Jr., Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\n\nSamuels is honored for his distinguished public service career.\u00a0 He began his career as a correctional officer and moved through the ranks before becoming the eighth director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons on Dec. 21, 2011.\u00a0 During his tenure as director, Samuels has significantly enhanced the operations of the largest agency in the department, thereby increasing public safety and reducing crime.\u00a0 He has refreshed the country\u2019s largest corrections system, bringing a renewed emphasis to the department and administration priorities, such as the Smart on Crime Initiative, prisoner reentry, Children of Incarcerated Parents, evidence based approaches to programs, solid labor-management relations, transparency and ensuring the most efficient use of taxpayer dollars.\u00a0 Samuels has made great strides in aligning the work of the department with the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 crime prevention mission through a variety of significant initiatives centered around enhancing safety of staff and inmates; increasing security and order inside federal prisons; increasing and improving inmate program offerings; realigning resources to increase efficiencies; increasing transparency with the public and stakeholders; enhancing labor-management relations; enhancing programs to strengthen bonds between incarcerated parents and their children; and expanding the use of sentence reduction mechanisms.\u00a0 Through continual direct communications with thousands of employees around the country, using web-based messages, videos and live teleconferences, he rallies staff around his message of making a positive difference in the lives of others.\n\nTheMary C. Lawton Lifetime Service Awardrecognizes employees who have served at least 20 years in the department and have demonstrated high standards of excellence and dedication throughout their careers.\u00a0 This award is presented only in exceptional circumstances to those individuals of special merit and is not awarded to express general appreciation for tenure alone.\u00a0 This year\u2019sMary C. Lawton Lifetime Service Awardis presented toJoyce R. Branda, the Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Division\u2019s Commercial Litigation Branch.\n\nDuring her distinguished 30-year career in the Civil Division, Branda has consistently made significant contributions to the department\u2019s mission and its people, which led to her being selected in 2012 as Deputy Assistant Attorney General, the highest ranking career manager in the Civil Division.\u00a0 Her exemplary management in that role has been reflected by her selection in September 2014 to serve as the Acting Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Division.\u00a0 Branda has demonstrated the highest standards of excellence and commitment throughout her career.\n\nThe William French Smith Award for Outstanding Contributions to Cooperative Law Enforcementis an honorary award granted to recognize state and local law enforcement officials who have made significant contributions to cooperative law enforcement endeavors.\n\nThis year\u2019s award is presented toBrian Bailey,Danny DoyleandJoshua Mauney, Task Force Officers of the U.S. Marshals Service-Southeast Regional Fugitive Task Force Investigative Operations Division.\n\nThis team assisted in an investigation that led to the successful arrest of Billy Lee Owens, a fugitive wanted on 22 outstanding warrants from five separate agencies.\u00a0 As evidenced by his criminal history and previous arrests, Owens was an infamous thief with a complete lack of regard for public safety in his attempts to evade capture.\u00a0 During the 48 hours prior to his capture, Owens led law enforcement officers on two vehicle pursuits, striking a dismounted task force officer with a stolen vehicle during one pursuit.\u00a0 On June 18, 2014, the recipients captured and arrested Owens.\n\nThe Attorney General\u2019s Award for Meritorious Public Serviceis the top public service award granted by the department, and is designed to recognize the most significant contributions of citizens and organizations that have assisted the department in the accomplishment of its mission and objectives.\u00a0 One Meritorious Public Service award is presented this year toMichael Lieberman, Washington Counsel and Director at the Anti-Defamation League Civil Rights Policy Planning Center.\n\nLieberman is recognized for his significant contributions to the enactment and implementation of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.\u00a0 Prior to its enactment in 2009, Lieberman was a major contributor to the act\u2019s development, both as policy counsel for the Anti-Defamation League and as the organizer and leader of the Hate Crimes Coalition, a working group of diverse non-governmental organizations (NGOs) representing communities across the nation.\u00a0 Through his leadership in the coalition, Lieberman worked collegially and constructively with the department and Congress to secure passage of an effective and potent hate crimes statute.\u00a0 Since its enactment in 2009, Lieberman has been an active and helpful community partner in the department\u2019s implementation and enforcement of the act.\u00a0 He has worked with community groups and law enforcement across the nation to ensure that hate crimes are reported to law enforcement by working to build trust between community groups and local law enforcement through outreach and training events; expanding the Uniform Crime Report to collect hate crimes data on more religions; developing a law enforcement guide for identifying and reporting cases of hate crimes based on gender identity; providing active NGO participation in NGO/law enforcement joint hate crimes trainings across the nation; and filing amicus briefs in federal and state hate crimes cases on appeal that support the department\u2019s legal positions on the act.\u00a0 Through these efforts and more, Lieberman has made significant contributions that assist the department in the accomplishment of its mission and objectives.\n\nTheAttorney General\u2019s Award for Distinguished Serviceis the Justice Department\u2019s second-highest award for employee performance.\u00a0 The recipients of this award exemplify the highest commitment to the department\u2019s mission.\u00a0 Twelve Distinguished Service Awards are presented this year to individuals or teams of people.\n\nThe firstDistinguished Service Awardis presented to members of the team responsible for successfully litigating to enjoin anti-steering rules maintained by credit card companies.\u00a0 This team is honored for its outstanding achievements in prevailing in one of the most significant and challenging cases the department\u2019s Antitrust Division has litigated in decades.\u00a0 The Antitrust Division filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York in October 2010 to enjoin anti-steering rules maintained by American Express, MasterCard and Visa that prevented merchants from encouraging consumers to use lower-cost forms of payment.\u00a0 Because merchants had no ability under the defendants\u2019 rules to reward lower-cost credit card networks with increased transaction volume, the $50 billion in swipe fees that credit card networks collect from merchants each year were insulated from the forces of competition.\u00a0 The recipients negotiated successful settlements with Visa and MasterCard but continued to litigate against American Express until the case proceeded to a seven-week trial before Senior U.S. District Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis of the Eastern District of New York in the summer of 2014.\u00a0 In February 2015, Judge Garaufis found, after a full rule-of-reason analysis, that American Express violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act.\u00a0 The team persuaded Judge Garaufis of American Express\u2019s liability in spite of complex two-sided platform issues associated with the payments industry, American Express\u2019s relatively low market share, and a determined defense by a well-financed defendant represented by lawyers from some of the country\u2019s most prestigious litigation firms.\u00a0 Judge Garaufis complimented the parties for conducting the best trial he had ever presided.\u00a0 In addition to the significant benefits that the team\u2019s success will bring to American consumers, it will also pay dividends for the division for many years as potential future defendants evaluate their risks of litigating against the Antitrust Division.\n\nAward recipients include, from the Antitrust Division, Litigation III Section ChiefDavid Kully, Litigation III Section Assistant ChiefEthan Glass, Litigation III Section Trial AttorneysCraig Conrath,Andrew Ewalt,Mark Hamer,Gregg Malawer,Bennett Matelson,John Read,Lisa Scanlon,Joseph VardnerandRachel Zwolinski, Networks and Technology Section Trial AttorneyIhan Kim, Competition Policy Section EconomistsJeffrey LienandDiane Owenand Economic Litigation Section EconomistDeborah Minehart.\n\nThe second team to receive theDistinguished Service Awardreceives the award for its extraordinary work and exceptional service in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) investigation and litigation against Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services (S&P) for its issuance of fraudulently inflated ratings of Residential Mortgage Backed Securities (RMBS) and Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) in the run-up to the 2007 through 2008 financial crisis.\u00a0 The investigation and litigation, coordinated with related civil actions by 19 states and the District of Columbia, led to a record $1.375 billion settlement, half of which ($687.5 million) constitutes a penalty to be paid to the federal government, and is the largest penalty of its type ever paid by a credit rating agency.\u00a0 As part of the settlement, S&P admitted it ignored senior analysts within the company who complained it had given top ratings to financial products that were failing to perform as expected and it had declined to downgrade underperforming assets because it was worried that doing so would hurt the company\u2019s business.\u00a0 While this strategy helped S&P avoid disappointing its clients, it did major harm to investors, including federally insured financial institutions that suffered losses exceeding $20 billion and to the larger economy, contributing to the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.\u00a0 The litigation and its resolution provided further proof that the department will vigorously pursue investigations and litigation, no matter how challenging, to address misconduct that contributed to the financial crisis.\n\nAward recipients include, from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office of the Central District of California, Assistant U.

Carbone.\u00a0 This team is responsible for the successful prosecution of a group of New York state politicians for bribery and corruption, ranging from the highest ranks of state government, to the governing body of America\u2019s largest city, to the highest officials of a local municipality.\u00a0 The team conducted a complex undercover operation that exposed the broad extent and brazen nature of corruption in New York state politics and led to the arrest and conviction of five political figures with one more awaiting trial.\u00a0 Three of those defendants, the former majority leader and president pro tempore of the New York State senate and acting lieutenant governor of New York, a New York City councilman and a leader of a New York City Republican party, heavily contested the charges and were convicted after hard-fought trials.\u00a0 The team\u2019s work helped catalyze ongoing efforts at reform of New York state and local government.\n\nThe secondJohn Marshall Award for Trial of Litigationis presented to the team responsible for convicting serial killer and sexual predator Jorge Avila Torrez.\u00a0 As a result of the tireless efforts of investigators and prosecutors over the course of several years, Torrez was held accountable by a federal jury in April 2014 for the premeditated murders of three innocent victims and the abduction and sexually motivated assault of three survivors.\u00a0 Prosecutors charged Torrez with the capital murder of Amanda Jean Snell, a promising young petty officer in the U.S. Navy, who was found dead in her barracks near the Pentagon in July 2009.\u00a0 Although Snell\u2019s death was not ruled a homicide by the medical examiner, a later re-examination of the evidence, including DNA analysis, proved that she was the victim of a sexually motivated assault and murder.\u00a0 The prosecution team proved that Torrez was also responsible for attacks on three young women in Arlington, Virginia, and the brutal murder of two young girls in Zion, Illinois, despite the fact that an innocent man stood accused of the Illinois killings for approximately five years.\u00a0 Following a lengthy trial involving the presentation of more than 60 witnesses and hundreds of exhibits, the defendant was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to death.\n\nAward recipients include, from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office of the Eastern District of Virginia, Assistant U.S. AttorneysJonathan L. FaheyandMichael E. Rich, Special Assistant U.S. AttorneyRobert J. Heberleand Senior Litigation CounselJames L.

(now known as Navient Solutions Inc.), SLM DE Corporation (now known as Navient DE Corporation) and Sallie Mae Bank (collectively Sallie Mae) failed to provide members of the military the 6 percent interest rate cap to which they were entitled in violation of the SCRA.\u00a0 The department\u2019s settlement was the result of a joint effort with the U.S. Department of Education (ED), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s Office of Servicemember Affairs.\u00a0 It requires Sallie Mae to pay $60 million in compensation to over 60,000 service members and to streamline the process by which service members may obtain interest rate reductions in the future.\u00a0 Attorney General Holder announced this landmark settlement along with ED Secretary Arne Duncan, who announced ED\u2019s plans to adopt new industry-wide streamlined procedures that will minimize administrative burdens on service members and allow more of them to obtain the SCRA benefits to which they are entitled.\n\nAward recipients include, from the Civil Rights Division\u2019s Housing and Civil Enforcement Section, ChiefSteven H. Rosenbaumand Trial AttorneysTanya I. KirwanandElizabeth A. Singer.\n\nThe firstJohn Marshall Award for Support of Litigationis presented to this team for their exceptional performance in three trials under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act against members of La ONU, one of the largest and most violent drug trafficking organizations in Puerto Rico.\u00a0 The three trials focused on the drug trafficking activities and the numerous murders committed by the organization.\u00a0 La ONU\u2019s quest to maintain and increase their power of the drug trade led them to commit some of the most brazen murders seen in Puerto Rico, which cost the lives of ordinary law-abiding citizens.\u00a0 Among the murders that the recipients proved during the trials was the downing of a police helicopter by a member of La ONU, who shot at the helicopter during flight with an AK-47 rifle, killing the co-pilot.\u00a0 The recipients also proved the murder of a police woman and a librarian who were driving to work when they were caught in the crossfire and killed during a shootout between members of La ONU and their main rival.\u00a0 In total, the team convicted seven defendants who were all sentenced to life in prison.\u00a0 The defendants who were convicted included La ONU\u2019s leader and main enforcers.\u00a0 As a result of the convictions obtained in the three trials, La ONU was significantly weakened.\u00a0 Moreover, the conviction of the defendants involved in these murders brought peace to the citizens of Puerto Rico, as they would no longer be threatened by members of an organization whose brazenness put at risk the lives of law-abiding citizens.\n\nAward recipients include, from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office of the District of Puerto Rico, Assistant U.S. AttorneysVictor O. Acevedo-HernandezandJenifer Y. Hernandez-Vega.\n\nThe secondJohn Marshall Award for Support of Litigationis presented toRichard Farber, Senior Appellate Counsel in the Tax Division\u2019s Appellate Section.\u00a0 Farber is presented this award for his exceptional record of accomplishments in support of litigation of the most important tax cases that are presented to the federal courts of appeals.\u00a0 He has long been regarded as an appellate advocate of the highest caliber and for that reason he has, for many years, been asked to supervise the government\u2019s appellate litigation in the most important and complex tax cases.\u00a0 Over the past two years alone, his astute supervision of the government\u2019s litigating strategy has saved more than $1 billion in revenue.\u00a0 Moreover, Farber has made major contributions to the Tax Division\u2019s mission of protecting the public fisc.\n\nThe firstJohn Marshall Award for Handling of Appealsis presented toVijay Shanker, Deputy Chief in the Criminal Division\u2019s Appellate Section.\u00a0 Shanker is presented this award for his superlative skill in appellate advocacy.\u00a0 Never flummoxed by a short deadline or a long dormant statute suddenly restored to life, he excels at solving puzzles and translating the solution into persuasive but crisp prose.\u00a0 Shanker routinely handles complex cases requiring meticulous analysis, thorough research and an orderly, scholarly and clear presentation.\u00a0 At oral argument, he knows that fist-pounding and hyperbole destroy credibility and that when representing the United States, earning the court\u2019s trust and respect is critical.\u00a0 The soft-spoken Shanker earns that trust by anticipating the toughest questions and focusing on the key points needed to win.\u00a0 With superlative skill and integrity, he has secured dozens of appellate victories for the government, defending the convictions of violent carjackers and robbers, fraudsters and corrupt public officials, drug dealers, narcoterrorists and criminals who exploit children.\u00a0 He has also obtained several ground-breaking decisions on issues that lay at the intersection of forfeiture law, international relations and terrorism.\u00a0 Additionally, Shanker finds time to provide legal advice to department\u2019s leadership and prosecutors on a variety of issues.\n\nThe secondJohn Marshall Award for Handling of Appealsis presented to the Bay Mills Indian Community team for its outstanding win in a case by the state of Michigan that presented a direct, frontal-assault on the concept of tribal sovereign immunity from suit in the absence of Congressional authorization.\u00a0 Against a backdrop of bad facts in which to litigate this issue (apparently unlawful gaming by the tribe), the team presented cogent arguments as to why Congress had not authorized the kind of suit the state had brought and presented other clear avenues by which the state could obtain review of the legality of the tribe\u2019s actions without necessitating a complete revision of tribal sovereign immunity concepts.\u00a0 Favorable decisions in the U.S. Supreme Court for Indian tribes have been quite scarce over the last decades.\u00a0 This decision was a shining star, achieved because of the team\u2019s stellar work.\n\nAward recipients include, from the Environment and Natural Resources Division, the Office of the Assistant Attorney General-Senior Counsel for Indian AffairsGina L. Allery, Indian Resources Section Deputy ChiefJohn H. Turner Jr., and Appellate Section Assistant ChiefWilliam B. Lazarusand AttorneyMary Gabrielle Sprague; from the Office of the Solicitor General, Deputy Solicitor GeneralEdwin S. Kneedlerand Assistant to the Solicitor GeneralAnn E. O\u2019Connell.\n\nThe firstJohn Marshall Award for Providing Legal Adviceis presented to the team responsible for guiding the department to its new position regarding Title VII and gender identity.\u00a0 In December 2014, Attorney General Holder announced that it is now the view of the department that Title VII\u2019s prohibition on sex discrimination reaches discrimination due to gender identity, gender transition and transgender status.\u00a0 This announcement was the culmination of many years of not only legal analysis and internal discussion, but also outreach to stakeholders within the government and beyond.\u00a0 Transgender individuals are among the most marginalized in our society, and thus they are sorely in need of the protections of federal antidiscrimination law.\u00a0 Consequently, the significance of the department\u2019s change in position cannot be overstated.\n\nAward recipients include, from the Civil Rights Division, Deputy Assistant Attorney GeneralGregory B. Frieland former Deputy Assistant Attorney GeneralPamela S. Karlan, and from the division\u2019s Appellate Section, ChiefDiana K. Flynn, Deputy ChiefSharon M.

Gary, Deputy General CounselBarbara A. Bush, Assistant General CounselsJohn R. Caterini,Kristen Bucher Hahn,Barry C. Hansen,Pamela J. Jadwin,Morton J. Posner,Evelyn S. TangandJohn E.

Allen.\n\nThis year\u2019sJohn Marshall Award for Alternative Dispute Resolutionis presented toDaniel Tenny, Trial Attorney in the Civil Division\u2019s Appellate Section.\u00a0 Tenny is presented this award for achieving a groundbreaking settlement of much publicized litigation that was closely followed by veterans groups and members of Congress.\u00a0 InValentini v. McDonald, homeless veterans claimed, and the district court found, that the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) was improperly allowing land at its West Los Angeles Campus to be used for commercial purposes.\u00a0 Tenny\u2019s intensive efforts over more than a year were central to the settlement, in which Tenny worked directly with the VA Secretary and disentangled the legal issues posed by the litigation from the substantive and policy issues on which the parties agreed.\u00a0 The settlement has been lauded by commentators who had previously been critical of VA\u2019s operations in West Los Angeles as a new beginning and an opportunity to achieve significant policy objectives that would have been impossible if the parties had continued in an adversarial fashion.\u00a0 The parties have already begun working together on new homelessness plans and on a process for making better use of the West Los Angeles campus, outside the context of any adversarial litigation.\u00a0 Tenny achieved far more than could have been accomplished by success in the litigation and his work exemplifies the means by which the adversarial process can be transformed into a constructive endeavor.\n\nThis year\u2019sJohn Marshall Award for Interagency Cooperationis presented toDustin F. Minor, Hazardous Waste Branch Chief in the Office of Regional Counsel \u2013 Region 9 of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\u00a0 Minor has demonstrated extraordinary cooperation with ENRD\u2019s Environmental Enforcement and Environmental Defense Sections in connection with its joint efforts to pursue parties responsible for the contamination of over 500 abandoned uranium mines on Navajo Nation lands.\u00a0 These abandoned mines have contaminated land near Navajo homes, roads, grazing lands and cultural areas, resulting in one of the most severe environmental justice problems in Indian Country.\u00a0 Minor played an important role supporting the Environmental Defense Section in its ground-breaking work to craft a settlement with the Navajo Nation that will lead to the important response measures to address the uranium contamination resulting from mining on Navajo lands.\u00a0 He has also played an essential role in the work of a combined EPA/department team to litigate against responsible private parties and to foster outreach to the Navajo Nation.\u00a0 Minor played an equally central role helping litigate and settle consolidated Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act actions in connection with a 160-acre contaminated Superfund site in Rialto, California, litigation that was unusually challenging due to its extensive discovery and contentious disputes over its 10-year history.\u00a0 Ultimately, five separate consent decrees were entered, which together will result in the cleanup of the entire site at a cost of approximately $100 million.\u00a0 Minor played an important role in finding creative solutions that enabled both EPA and the U.S. Department of Defense to settle on terms that were appropriate to each agency.",

            "article_text": "The former Chair of Harvard University\u2019s Chemistry and Chemical Biology Department was indicted today on charges of making false statements to federal authorities regarding his participation in China\u2019s Thousand Talents Program.\n\nDr. Charles Lieber, 61, has been indicted by a federal grand jury on two counts of making false statements and will be arraigned in federal court in Boston at a later date. \u00a0Lieber was arrested on Jan. 28, 2020, and charged by criminal complaint.\n\nAccording to charging documents, since 2008, Dr. Lieber has served as the Principal Investigator of the Lieber Research Group at Harvard University, specializing in the area of nanoscience. Lieber\u2019s research at the Lieber Research Group has been funded by more than $15 million in research grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Department of Defense (DOD).\u00a0 Among other things, these grants required the disclosure of all sources of research support, potential financial conflicts of interest and all foreign collaboration.\n\nIt is alleged that, unbeknownst to Harvard University, beginning in 2011, Lieber became a \u201cStrategic Scientist\u201d at Wuhan University of Technology (WUT) in China. \u00a0He later became contractual participant in China\u2019s Thousand Talents Plan from at least 2012 through 2015.\u00a0 China\u2019s Thousand Talents Plan is one of the most prominent Chinese talent recruitment plans designed to attract, recruit, and cultivate high-level scientific talent in furtherance of China\u2019s scientific development, economic prosperity and national security. \u00a0According to court documents, these talent recruitment plans seek to lure Chinese overseas talent and foreign experts to bring their knowledge and experience to China, and they often reward individuals for stealing proprietary information. \u00a0Under the terms of Lieber\u2019s three-year Thousand Talents contract, WUT allegedly paid Lieber a salary of up to $50,000 USD per month, living expenses of up to 1 million Chinese Yuan (approximately $158,000 USD at the time) and awarded him more than $1.5 million to establish a research lab at WUT. \u00a0In return, Lieber was obligated to work for WUT \u201cnot less than nine months a year\u201d by \u201cdeclaring international cooperation projects, cultivating young teachers and Ph.D. students, organizing international conference[s], applying for patents and publishing articles in the name of [WUT].\u201d\n\nIt is alleged that in 2018 and 2019, Lieber lied to federal authorities about his involvement in the Thousand Talents Plan and his affiliation with WUT. On or about April 24, 2018, during an interview with federal investigators, it is alleged that Lieber falsely stated that he was never asked to participate in the Thousand Talents Program, but that he \u201cwasn\u2019t sure\u201d how China categorized him. \u00a0In November 2018, NIH inquired of Harvard about whether Lieber had failed to disclose his then-suspected relationship with WUT and China\u2019s Thousand Talents Plan. \u00a0Lieber allegedly caused Harvard to falsely tell NIH that Lieber \u201chad no formal association with WUT\u201d after 2012, that \u201cWUT continued to falsely exaggerate\u201d his involvement with WUT in subsequent years, and that Lieber \u201cis not and has never been a participant in\u201d China\u2019s Thousand Talents Plan.\n\nThe charge of making false statements provides for a sentence of up to five years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000. \u00a0Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nAssistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers; U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts Andrew E. Lelling; Joseph R. Bonavolonta, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Boston Field Division; Leigh-Alistair Barzey, Special Agent in Charge of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, Northeast Field Office; and Philip Coyne, Special Agent in Charge of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General made this announcement. \u00a0Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jason Casey and Benjamin Tolkoff of Lelling\u2019s National Security Unit are prosecuting this case with the assistance of Trial Attorney David Aaron of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.\n\nThe details contained in the charging documents are allegations. The defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.",

            "article_text": "The Department announced today the arrest of Zhongsan Liu, who was charged by complaint for his involvement in a conspiracy to fraudulently obtain U.S. visas for Chinese government employees.\u00a0 Liu was arrested today in Fort Lee, New Jersey, and presented this afternoon in Manhattan federal court before the U.S. Magistrate Judge Ona T. Wang.\n\n\u201cWe welcome foreign students and researchers, including from China, but we do not welcome visa fraud \u2013 especially on behalf of a government,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers of National Security.\u00a0 \u201cWe will continue to confront Chinese government attempts to subvert American law to advance its own interests in diverting U.S. research and know-how to China.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs alleged Zhongsan Liu conspired to obtain research scholar visas fraudulently for people whose actual purpose was not research but recruitment,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman.\u00a0 \u201cRather than helping to bring students to the U.S., Liu allegedly conspired to defraud this country\u2019s visa system to advance his efforts to attract U.S. experts to China.\u00a0 Thanks to the FBI, this alleged abuse of the visa system has been halted.\u201d\n\n\"Zhongsan Liu broke the law by seeking visas for employees of the government of The People's Republic of China to enter the United States under false pretenses.\u00a0 Individuals obtained visas under the guise of research scholars, but in reality their assignment was to recruit top U.S. talent to benefit the government of China,\" said Assistant Director John Brown of the FBI's Counterintelligence Division. \"The FBI recognizes the immense benefit of academic freedom in our open society, and we will investigate those who break our laws in an effort to take advantage of that freedom.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe allegation that an employee of a foreign government has worked to mask the true purpose of an individual\u2019s presence in the United States isn\u2019t news to the FBI,\u201d said FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr.\u00a0 \u201cThis alleged behavior should be another alarm bell that foreign governments are constantly working to exploit research work being conducted throughout the United States.\u00a0 Not everyone shares the honest goal of conducting open research to benefit society as a whole.\u00a0 This case is another example of the pervasive and organized effort, in this instance an allegedly flat-out illegal one, to fulfill a top priority of collecting information to advantage a foreign adversary.\u00a0 Putting a halt to Mr. Liu\u2019s alleged actions are an important and significant step to highlighting these activities.\u00a0 The FBI New York, along with our intelligence community partners, will continue to disrupt the behavior when it is detected.\u201d\n\nAccording to the allegations in the Complaint unsealed in Manhattan federal court:\n\nFrom approximately 2017, up to and including September 2019, Liu participated in a conspiracy to fraudulently procure U.S. visas for employees of the government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC Government).\u00a0 Liu operates the New York office of the China Association for International Exchange of Personnel (CAIEP-NY).\u00a0 CAIEP-NY is a PRC Government agency that, among other things, recruits U.S. scientists, academics, engineers and other experts to work in China.\n\nLiu worked with others, including other PRC Government employees in the United States, to fraudulently procure J-1 Research Scholar visas for a CAIEP-NY employee (CC-1) and a prospective CAIEP-NY employee (the CAIEP-NY Hire).\u00a0 The J-1 Research Scholar visa program permits foreign nationals to come to the United States for the primary purpose of conducting research at a corporate research facility, museum, library, university or other research institution.\n\nIn or about April 2018, CC-1 applied for and received a J-1 visa to conduct research at a particular U.S. university (University-1) located outside of New York.\u00a0 Although CC-1 represented to the U.S. Government that she was entering the United States for the primary purpose of conducting research at University-1, CC-1\u2019s actual purpose in the United States consisted of performing full-time talent-recruitment work at CAIEP-NY.\u00a0 Liu helped CC-1 take measures to enhance her false appearance as a Research Scholar at University-1 by, among other things, directing CC-1 to report to University-1 upon her arrival in the United States; ensuring that CC-1 obtained a driver\u2019s license in the state where University-1 is located; and instructing CC-1 to periodically visit University-1 while working full-time at CAIEP-NY.\n\nIn addition, Liu attempted to enable the CAIEP-NY Hire to obtain a J-1 Research Scholar visa under false pretenses.\u00a0 In particular, Liu reached out to contacts at multiple U.S. universities in order to arrange for a university to invite the CAIEP-NY Hire to come to the United States as a J-1 Research Scholar.\u00a0 In truth and in fact, however, Liu intended that the CAIEP-NY Hire\u2019s primary purpose in the United States would consist of engaging full-time in the talent-recruitment work of CAIEP-NY.\n\nLiu, 57, of Fort Lee, New Jersey, is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit visa fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of five years.\u00a0 The maximum potential sentence in this case is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the judge.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Demers and U.S. Attorney Berman praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI, and thanked the U.S. Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, Homeland Security Investigations, and the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section of the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s National Security Division for their assistance.\n\nThis case is being handled by the Office\u2019s Terrorism and International Narcotics Unit.\u00a0 Assistant United States Attorney Gillian Grossman is in charge of the prosecution.\n\nThe charges contained in the Complaint are merely accusations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.",

            "article_text": "A federal court in Texas sentenced two former dietary supplement company executives to prison and ordered two companies to pay a combined $10.7 million in criminal forfeiture for their roles in fraudulently selling popular workout supplements, the Justice Department announced today.\n\nOn Oct. 13, 2020, U.S. District Judge Sam A. Lindsay sentenced former USPlabs CEO Jacobo Geissler, 44, of University Park, Texas, to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment. On October 15, Judge Lindsay sentenced former USPLabs president Jonathan Doyle, 41, of Dallas, to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment. In addition, the Court ordered each defendant to pay a criminal fine of $250,000. The Court previously sentenced USPlabs to pay $4.7 million in criminal forfeiture, and sentenced another company, SK Laboratories Inc., to forfeit $6 million in connection with the case. All of the defendants were charged in a 2015 indictment returned by a federal grand jury in the Northern District of Texas.\n\n\u201cConsumers rely on dietary supplement manufacturers to accurately represent the ingredients in their products and ensure that they are safe to consume,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Bossert Clark of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division.\u00a0 \u201cWe will tirelessly investigate and prosecute individuals and companies that place profits before the safety of consumers.\u201d\n\n\u201cDietary supplement companies cannot be allowed to deceive their consumers and hide the fact that they are including untested ingredients in their products,\u201d said U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas Erin Nealy Cox. \u201cWe are committed to holding people who harm consumers accountable for their unconscionable behavior.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsumers of dietary supplements do not expect the products they purchase to put their health at risk. Distributing supplements that jeopardize consumer health by being falsely or misleadingly labeled will not be tolerated. The FDA will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who endanger the public\u2019s health and violate the law,\u201d said Judy McMeekin, Pharm.D., Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs, U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\n\u201cThe defendants in this case thought they could profit off the boom in dietary supplements, while blatantly concealing the true nature of the products they were peddling,\u201d said Assistant Special Agent in Charge Kevin Caramucci, Dallas Field Office. \u201cIRS-CI is proud to stand with our federal partners in investigating financial crimes that bilk millions of dollars from our honest taxpayers, especially when products such as those distributed by Mr. Geissler and Mr. Doyle caused so much harm.\u201d\n\nThe defendants each played roles in developing, manufacturing, or marketing the popular workout and weight loss supplements known as Jack3d and OxyElite Pro, which were distributed by USPlabs. In pleading guilty last year to conspiracy to introduce misbranded food into interstate commerce, Doyle and Geissler admitted that they imported substances with false and misleading labeling to avoid law enforcement and regulatory agency attention. SK Laboratories pleaded guilty to introduction of misbranded food into interstate commerce, and USPlabs pleaded guilty to conspiracy to introduce misbranded food into interstate commerce. The misbranding charges relate in part to OxyElite Pro, which was recalled in 2013 in the wake of an investigation by the Food and Drug Administration into whether the supplement caused liver injuries in consumers. The indictment alleged that the defendants sold some of their products without determining whether they would be safe to use.\n\nThree other individuals also pleaded guilty and are expected to be sentenced in the coming months. Cyril Willson, 39, of Ralston, Nebraska, and Matthew Hebert, 42, of Dallas, pleaded guilty to introducing misbranded food into interstate commerce with the intent to defraud or mislead. Sitesh Patel, 37, of Irvine, California, the vice president of S.K. Laboratories, a California dietary supplement manufacturer, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to introduce misbranded food into interstate commerce and to the introduction of misbranded food into interstate commerce.\n\nAccording to the indictment, sales of USPlabs products related to the conspiracy brought the company hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. The indictment alleged that the defendants participated in a conspiracy to import dietary supplement ingredients from China, including the stimulant known as \u201cDMAA,\u201d using false certificates of analysis and false labeling, and then lied about the source and nature of those ingredients. According to the indictment, the defendants told some of their retailers and wholesalers that USPlabs products contained natural plant extracts, when in fact they contained a synthetic stimulant manufactured in a Chinese chemical factory.\n\nThe case was investigated by Special Agent Chad Medaris and former Special Agent Liam Gimon of FDA\u2019s Office of Criminal Investigations and Special Agent Larissa Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorneys David Sullivan, Patrick Runkle, and Raquel Toledo with the Consumer Protection Branch of the Department of Justice\u2019s Civil Division, and Assistant United States Attorneys Errin Martin and John DelaGarza of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Texas.\n\nAdditional information about the Consumer Protection Branch and its enforcement efforts may be found athttp://www.justice.gov/civil/consumer-protection-branch.

            "article_text": "GREENEVILLE, Tenn. \u2013 On May 9, 2022, Dr. Xiaorong You, aka Shannon You, 59, of Lansing, Michigan was sentenced to serve 168 months in prison by the Honorable J. Ronnie Greer, U.S. District Judge in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee. Following her imprisonment, the defendant was also ordered to serve three years of supervised release and pay a $200,000 fine.\n\nIn April 2021, following a thirteen-day trial, a federal jury convicted You of conspiracy to commit trade secret theft in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1832(a)(5), conspiracy to commit economic espionage in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1831(a)(5), possession of stolen trade secrets in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1832(a)(3), economic espionage 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1831(a)(3), and wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343.\n\nAccording to court documents and evidence presented at trial, You stole valuable trade secrets related to formulations for bisphenol-A-free (BPA-free) coatings for the inside of beverage cans. \u00a0You was granted access to the trade secrets while working at The Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta, Georgia, and Eastman Chemical Company in Kingsport, Tennessee. \u00a0The stolen trade secrets belonged to major chemical and coating companies, including Akzo-Nobel, BASF, Dow Chemical, PPG, Toyochem, Sherwin Williams, and Eastman Chemical Company, and cost nearly $120,000,000 to develop.\n\nYou stole the trade secrets to set up a new BPA-free coating company in China. \u00a0You and her Chinese corporate partner, Weihai Jinhong Group received millions of dollars in Chinese government grants to support the new company. \u00a0Documents and other evidence presented at trial, showed You\u2019s intent to benefit not only Weihai Jinhong Group, but also the governments of China, the Chinese province of Shandong, and the Chinese city of Weihai, as well as her intent to benefit the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nUntil recently, BPA was used universally to coat the inside of cans and other food and beverage containers to help minimize flavor loss and prevent the container from corroding or reacting with the food or beverage contained therein. \u00a0However, due to BPA\u2019s potential health risks, companies began searching for BPA-free alternatives. \u00a0As witnesses from the chemical and coating companies testified at trial, developing these BPA-free alternatives was a very complex, expensive and time-consuming process.\n\nEvidence presented at trial showed that from December 2012 through Aug. 31, 2017, You was employed as Principal Engineer for Global Research at Coca-Cola, which had agreements with numerous companies to conduct research and development, testing, analysis, and review of various BPA-free technologies. \u00a0Because of You\u2019s extensive education and experience with BPA and BPA-free coating technologies, she was one of a limited number of Coca-Cola employees with access to BPA-free trade secrets belonging to Akzo-Nobel, BASF, Dow Chemical, PPG, Toyochem, and Sherwin Williams. \u00a0From approximately September 2017 through June 2018, You was employed as a packaging application development manager for Eastman Chemical Company in Kingsport, Tennessee, where she was one of a limited number of employees with access to trade secrets belonging to Eastman.\n\n\u201cAs the evidence at trial showed, the defendant stole valuable trade secrets and intended to use them to benefit not only a foreign company, but also the government of China,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division. \u201cToday\u2019s sentence reflects the seriousness of this offense, as well as the Department of Justice\u2019s commitment to protect our nation\u2019s security by investigating and prosecuting those who steal U.S. companies\u2019 intellectual property.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen companies invest huge amounts of time and money to develop world-class technologies, only to have those technologies stolen, the results are devastating,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr. of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u00a0\u201cHere, the defendant intended not only to enrich herself and her China-based partners, but also the government of China. \u00a0Crimes like the defendant\u2019s threaten both victim companies and the economic security of the nation as a whole. \u00a0This case should serve as a warning to those entrusted with valuable trade secrets: if you break the law, you will be punished.\u201d\n\n\u201cStealing trade secrets of U.S. companies for the benefit of the Chinese government will be vigorously prosecuted in the Eastern District of Tennessee, and today\u2019s 14-year sentence reflects the seriousness of this defendant\u2019s crimes,\u201d said U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Tennessee Francis M. Hamilton III.\u00a0 \u201cThe corporate vigilance and subsequent cooperation with federal law enforcement that brought this defendant to justice is to be commended; our national security depends on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cStealing technology isn\u2019t just a crime against a company,\u201d said Acting Assistant Director Bradley S. Benavides of the FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Division. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a crime against American workers whose jobs and livelihoods are impacted. \u00a0Today\u2019s sentencing is a reminder that the FBI and its partners will hold accountable those who break our laws and threaten our economic and national security.\u201d\n\n\u201cIngenuity, innovation, and perseverance are the time-honored trademarks of American business and entrepreneurship. \u00a0In the current global state of commerce, corporations are forced to place an increased emphasis on the protection of trade secrets and intellectual property. \u00a0The FBI will not sit by while any nation-state attempts to steal or incentivizes the theft of trade secrets from successful corporations.\u00a0 The FBI is committed to working with industry to hold those accountable who would attempt to steal technology or trade secrets at the cost of American businesses, their employees, and their livelihood,\u201d said Joseph E. Carrico, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Knoxville office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the National Security Division; Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division; and U.S. Attorney Francis M. Hamilton III for the Eastern District of Tennessee made the announcement.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s Knoxville Field Office and Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Homeland Security Investigation (HSI) investigated the case.\n\nFormer Assistant U.S. Attorney T.J. Harker of the Eastern District of Tennessee; Senior Counsel Matt Walczewski of the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section; and Trial Attorney Nic Hunter of the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section prosecuted the case.\n\n###",

has agreed to pay $1.1 million to resolve allegations that it violated the False Claims Act by failing to disclose a foreign component of a National Institutes of Health (\u201cNIH\u201d) award and by failing to disclose foreign research support for two VARI researchers who served as principal investigators on NIH awards. \u00a0In addition to this settlement\u2014the second settlement with VARI in two years involving allegations of undisclosed foreign influence in federally-sponsored research\u2014NIH imposed Specific Award Conditions on all of VARI\u2019s NIH grants, including by requiring

Component\u201d).\u00a0 Foreign Components can include collaborations with foreign researchers who perform experiments in support of an NIH grant, regardless of whether those foreign researchers receive any of the NIH funding.\u00a0 NIH also requires grant recipients to disclose \u201cOther Support,\u201d defined asallresources made available to researchers in support of and/or related toallof their research endeavors, regardless of whether such resources have monetary value.\u00a0 Other Support includes high-value materials that are not freely available (biologics,e.g.) and selection to foreign talent recruitment programs.\n\nIn December 2019, VARI paid $5.5 million to resolve allegations that it violated the False Claims Act by submitting grant applications and progress reports to NIH in which VARI failed to disclose Other Support, including Chinese government grants that funded two VARI researchers.\u00a0 Approximately one month later, in January 2020, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (\u201cCBP\u201d) stopped an individual\u2014a former VARI researcher and current professor at the Harbin Institute of Technology (\u201cHIT\u201d) in China (the \u201cHIT Professor\u201d)\u2014at Detroit Metro Airport with undeclared biological research samples in his luggage.\u00a0 The government alleged that the HIT Professor told CBP that the research samples were intended for the laboratory of a professor at VARI (the \u201cVARI Professor\u201d).\u00a0 The CBP stop prompted another investigation of VARI that resulted in the following allegations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government also expressed concerns that in November 2018, the VARI Professor separately sent his NIH award letter to an NAU professor in China who requested proof that he was collaborating with a researcher funded by the American government.\n\nApproximately one-third of the settlement funds will be returned to NIH, with the remainder going to the United States Treasury. \u00a0In addition to the $1.1 million settlement, NIH imposed Specific Award Conditions on all of VARI\u2019s NIH grants.\u00a0 Federal regulations allow NIH to impose Specific Award Conditions on grant recipients, including on recipients that have a history of failures to comply with the terms of a federal award.\u00a0 In this case, NIH is requiring an executive-level manager to personally certify the accuracy of all of VARI\u2019s \u201cOther Support\u201d disclosures.\u00a0 NIH is also withdrawing certain of VARI\u2019s expanded budget authorities and removing VARI from SNAP prior to awards.\u00a0 These conditions will remain in place through September 30, 2022 or until NIH assesses and accepts VARI\u2019s completed Corrective Action Plan and summary report.\n\nThis case was a cooperative effort among HHS-OIG, the FBI, and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Michigan.\u00a0 Assistant U.S. Attorney Adam B.

            "article_text": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2013 Song Chen has been charged in a criminal complaint with visa fraud in connection with a scheme to lie about her status as an active member of the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s military forces while in the United States conducting research at Stanford University, announced United States Attorney David L. Anderson and Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent in Charge John L. Bennett.\u00a0 Song made her initial federal court appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge Sallie Kim this morning to face the charge.\n\nThe allegations describing the crime appear in an affidavit supporting the complaint filed on July 17, 2020.\u00a0 According to the affidavit, Song, 38, a Chinese national, entered the United States on December 23, 2018, using a J-1 non-immigrant visa.\u00a0 Song obtained the J-1 visa, a document \u201cfor individuals approved to participate in work-and study-based exchange visitor programs,\u201d with an application she submitted in November 2018.\u00a0 In that application, Song stated that she had served in the Chinese military only from September 1, 2000, through June 30, 2011.\u00a0 She further stated that her employer was \u201cXi Diaoyutai Hospital\u201d located at \u201cNo. 30 Fucheng Road, Beijing, 100142.\u201d\u00a0 Song described herself in her visa application as a neurologist who was coming to the U.S. to conduct research at Stanford University related to brain disease.\n\nThe affidavit alleges that these were lies, and that Song was a member of the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA), the Chinese military, when she entered and while she was in the United States, and that the hospital she listed on her visa as her employer was a cover for her true employer, the PLA.\u00a0 Specifically, the affidavit identifies four research articles that she co-authored.\u00a0 These articles were identified on a resume that Song submitted to Stanford.\u00a0 The versions of the articles available via open sources on the Internet show her as affiliated with institutions subordinate to the PLA Air Force.\u00a0 Specifically, the articles list Song as affiliated with the Air Force General Hospital in Beijing and the Fourth Military Medical University (FMMU), a PLA Air Force university in Xi\u2019an.\u00a0 In addition, as of July 13, 2020, a Chinese health care website listed Song as an attending physician of the Department of Neurology of the PLA Air Force General Hospital, a hospital that shared an address with the \u201cXi Diaoyutai Hospital\u201d listed on her visa application.\u00a0 The listing allegedly included a photograph of Song wearing what appears to be a military uniform.\u00a0 Further, an article published in 2015 identifies Song as the doctor at the PLA Air Force hospital who performed the autopsy on the former chief physician of the MRI Department at the hospital.\n\nFinally, according to the affidavit, a search of Song\u2019s external hard drive, recovered pursuant to a court-authorized search warrant, found that, on June 21, 2020, Song had deleted a folder titled, in Chinese, \u201c2018 Visiting School Important Information.\u201d\u00a0 The search recovered deleted documents from this folder.\u00a0 The affidavit alleges that one of the recovered documents was a letter from Song to the Chinese Consulate in New York, which explained that she was extending her time in the United States for another year, and wrote that her stated employer, Beijing Xi Diaoyutai Hospital, is a false front, and that, as a result, she had obtained approval for her extension from the PLA Air Force and FMMU.\u00a0 The letter further allegedly explained that, as these Chinese military approval documents were classified, she could not transmit them online.\n\nSong was charged with obtaining a visa by material false statements, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546(a).\n\nThe complaint merely alleges that a crime has been committed, and Song, like all defendants, is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nIf convicted, she faces a maximum statutory penalty of up to 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.\u00a0 In addition, the court may order additional terms of supervised release.\u00a0 However, any sentence following conviction would be imposed by the court only after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553.\n\nSong\u2019s next appearance is scheduled for Tuesday, July 21, 2020, before Magistrate Judge Kim for further proceedings regarding detention.\n\nThe prosecution is being handled by the Office of the U.S. Attorney, Northern District of California\u2019s Special Prosecutions Section and is the result of an investigation by the FBI.",

            "article_text": "A rheumatology professor and researcher with strong ties to China pleaded guilty to making false statements to federal authorities as part of an immunology research fraud scheme.\n\nSong Guo Zheng, 58, of Hilliard, appeared in federal court today, at which time his guilty plea was accepted by Chief U.S. District Judge Algenon L. Marbley.\n\n\u201cFederal research funding is provided by the American tax payers for the benefit of American society \u2014 not as a subsidy for the Chinese Government,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers.\u00a0 \u201cThe American people deserve total transparency when federal dollars are being provided for research, and we will continue to hold accountable those who choose to lie about their foreign government affiliations in an attempt to fraudulently gain access to these funds.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe FBI and its partners are a unified front in protecting taxpayer-funded research, so there is no escape for those who break America\u2019s laws. Whether it\u2019s a midnight flight through Alaska or hiding in plain sight, we will find you and bring you to justice,\u201d said Assistant Director Alan E. Kohler, Jr. of the FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Division.\n\n\u201cZheng promised China he would enhance the country\u2019s biomedical research. He was preparing to flee the United States after he learned that his American employer had begun an administrative process into whether or not he was complying with American taxpayer-funded grant rules,\u201d said David M. DeVillers, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio.\u00a0\u201cToday\u2019s plea reinforces our proven commitment to protect our country\u2019s position as a global leader in research and innovation, and to punish those who try to exploit and undermine that position.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe FBI and our law enforcement partners continue to engage with universities to protect sensitive research from being illegally transferred to foreign governments,\u201d stated FBI Cincinnati Special Agent in Charge Chris Hoffman. \u201cToday's plea represents an acknowledgement by Zheng not only of his violation of the trust given to him by the U.S. Government in the form of federal grant funds, but also of norms for research integrity and an abuse of the openness and transparency in the U.S. academic system.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe purpose of reporting potential conflicts of interest is to protect the integrity of professional judgment and ensure the public\u2019s trust in the research being conducted,\u201d said Lamont Pugh III, Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, Office of Inspector General \u2013 Chicago Region. \u201cThis defendant violated that trust by failing to report his financial interests and affiliations with foreign parties in an effort to improperly obtain research grant funding through the National Institutes of Health. The OIG is committed to identifying and investigating instances where individuals intentionally fail to report or falsify information regarding their sources of research support in order to ensure the proper use of taxpayer dollars.\u201d\n\nAs part of his plea, Zheng admitted he lied on applications in order to use approximately $4.1 million in grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to develop China\u2019s expertise in the areas of rheumatology and immunology.\n\nZheng was a professor of internal medicine who led a team conducting autoimmune research at The Ohio State University and Pennsylvania State University. According to his plea, Zheng caused materially false and misleading statements on NIH grant applications, seeking to hide his participation in Chinese Talent Plans and his affiliation and collaboration with a Chinese university controlled by the Chinese government. Making false statements to the federal government is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison.\n\nZheng was arrested Friday, May 22, 2020, after he arrived in Anchorage, Alaska, aboard a charter flight and as he prepared to board another charter flight to China.\u00a0When he was arrested, he was carrying three large bags, one small suitcase and a briefcase containing two laptops, three cell phones, several USB drives, several silver bars, expired Chinese passports for his family, deeds for property in China and other items.\n\nHe was transported to the Southern District of Ohio and made his first federal court appearance in Columbus on July 7, 2020.\n\nAccording to court documents, since 2013, Zheng had been participating in a Chinese Talent Plan, a program established by the Chinese government to recruit individuals with knowledge or access to foreign technology intellectual property.\u00a0Since that time, Zheng used research conducted in the United States to benefit the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u00a0Zheng failed to disclose conflicts of interest or his foreign commitments to his American employers or to the NIH.\n\nThis case was investigated by the FBI and Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General.\u00a0Assistant United States Attorneys Douglas W. Squires and S. Courter Shimeall, Special Assistant United States Attorney Christopher N. St. Pierre, and Trial Attorney Matthew J.

Chen was charged by criminal complaint and arrested on Jan. 14, 2021.\n\nAccording to charging documents, Chen is a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in China. He is a professor and researcher at MIT where he serves as Director of the MIT Pappalardo Micro/Nano Engineering Laboratory and Director of the Solid-State Solar Thermal Energy Conversion Center (S3TEC). Since approximately 2013, Chen\u2019s research at MIT has been funded by nearly $19 million in grants awarded by various U.S. federal agencies.\n\nSince 2012, Chen has allegedly held various appointments with the PRC designed to promote the PRC\u2019s technological and scientific development by providing advice and expertise \u2013 sometimes directly to PRC government officials \u2013 and often in exchange for financial compensation. This includes acting as an \u201coverseas expert\u201d for the PRC government at the request of the PRC Consulate Office in New York and serving as a member of at least two PRC Talent Programs. Since 2013, Chen allegedly received approximately $29 million of foreign funding, including $19 million from the PRC\u2019s Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech).\n\nFrom at least 2017 to 2019 when Chen was serving in several advisory roles for the PRC and PRC entities, Chen applied for and obtained a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) grant in order to fund a portion of his research at MIT.\u00a0 In doing so, it is alleged that Chen failed to disclose information about his ongoing affiliations with the PRC as required by DOE.\n\nChen also allegedly failed to disclose to the IRS in his 2018 tax return that he maintained a bank account in the PRC with more than $10,000 in 2018.\n\nThe charge of wire fraud provides for a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000. The charge of making false statements provides for a sentence of up to five years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000. The charge of failing to file an FBAR provides for a sentence of up to five years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000.

            "article_text": "Conspiracy Resulted in Launching of an Iranian Earth Observation  Satellite;Front Company Created to Conceal Iranian Involvement\n\nGreenbelt, Maryland - U.S. District Judge Peter J. Messitte sentenced Nader Modanlo, a/k/a Nader Modanlou, a/k/a Nader Modanlu, age 53, of Potomac, Maryland, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Iran, today to eight years in prison followed by three years of supervised release for conspiring to illegally provide satellite related services to Iran in violation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, two counts of violating the Iran Trade Embargo, money laundering and obstruction of bankruptcy proceedings. Judge Messitte also ordered Modanlo to forfeit $10 million.\n\nAs a result of the conspiracy, an Iranian earth observation satellite equipped with a camera was launched into space from Russia on October 27, 2005. The launch was the first-ever Iranian satellite put into orbit.\n\nThe sentence was announced by United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein; Special Agent in Charge William Winter of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI); Special Agent in Charge Thomas J. Kelly of the Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigation, Washington, D.C. Field Office; and Special Agent in Charge Robert Craig of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, Mid-Atlantic Field Office.\n\n\"Nader Modanlo violated the law by helping Iran launch communications satellites,\" said U.S. Attorney Rod J. Rosenstein. \"The Iran Trade Embargo prohibits Americans from supplying goods, technology and services to Iran directly or indirectly.\"\n\n\u201cThis sentencing is the result of a complex, decade-long HSI investigation that spanned multiple countries and involved close partnership with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Maryland, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service and the Internal Revenue Service,\u201d said HSI Baltimore Special Agent in Charge William Winter. \u201cThis investigation shows that HSI special agents will tenaciously pursue those who attempt to illegally export sensitive technologies and threaten the security of the United States by willfully violating our customs laws.\u201d\n\n\u201cThrough the joint efforts of IRS Criminal Investigation with our domestic and international law enforcement partners, Modanlo was brought to justice and convicted,\u201d said Thomas J. Kelly, Special Agent in Charge, IRS Criminal Investigation, Washington D.C. Field Office.  \u201cToday\u2019s sentencing is a reminder that IRS Criminal Investigation is committed to following the money trail across the globe and will not be deterred by the use of front companies and sophisticated financial transactions that hide the real ownership of the proceeds of criminal activity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sentencing action handed down today should send a clear message that the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) and its law enforcement partners will aggressively and tirelessly pursue and prosecute anyone who willfully violates laws that are designed to preserve and protect our nation\u2019s most critical technologies and resources,\u201d said Robert E. Craig, Jr., Special Agent in Charge of the DCIS Mid-Atlantic Field Office.  \u201cDCIS, the criminal investigative arm of the Office of Inspector General, Department of Defense (DoD), is committed to pursuing cases involving the illegal transfer of U.S. Defense Department-related technologies around the world and ensuring the safety of America\u2019s warfighters and all Americans.\u201d\n\nThe President of the United States issued an Executive Order in 1995 imposing a trade embargo against Iran, after finding that Iran's policies and actions posed a threat to the national security of the United States.  Under the embargo, the Department of the Treasury, through the Office of Foreign Assets Control, issued the Iranian Transactions Regulations, which prohibited the export, re-export, sale or supply, directly or indirectly, by a U.S. citizen, of goods, technology or services to Iran or the Government of Iran, without prior governmental authorization.\n\nAccording to evidence presented at the six week trial, Modanlo was a mechanical engineer who received science and engineering degrees from George Washington University. Modanlo represented that he was an internationally-recognized expert on strategic policy and finances affecting the space-based telecommunications industry, and that he managed space and science programs for the Department of Defense, NASA and the industry.\n\nTrial evidence showed that from January 2000 through November 27, 2007, Modanlo and others concocted an elaborate scheme to evade the Iran trade embargo to conceal Iranian involvement in prohibited activities and transactions. Beginning in 1992, Modanlo was the principal owner, chairman and president of Final Analysis, Inc. (FAI) in Maryland. Beginning in 1994, FAI contracted with POLYOT, an aerospace enterprise company owned by the government of the Russian Federation, to launch FAI telecommunications satellites. Between 1995 through 2000, FAI and POLYOT launched a satellite purchased by FAI, and designed, constructed and launched a second satellite, both from Plesetsk, Russia.  Modanlo and other FAI personnel met with POLYOT officials as part of that relationship. As required by law, Modanlo obtained U.S. export licenses in order to export and launch the telecommunications satellites and other equipment from Russia.\n\nIn November 2001, Modanlo established New York Satellite Industries, LLC, (NYSI) after creditors filed a petition to place FAI into involuntary bankruptcy. NYSI purchased FAI's assets and Modanlo served as chairman and managing member of NYSI, using his home address as NYSI's business address.\n\nBeginning in 2000, Modanlo brokered an agreement between POLYOT and Iran to construct and launch a satellite.   Between the summer of 2001 and December 2001, Modanlo engaged in numerous meetings with POLYOT officials to broker Iran=s satellite program.  In December 2001, several Iranian officials, including Sirous Naseri, a former Iranian Amabassador to Switzerland, went to Switzerland to express interest in \"investing\" in NYSI by interposing a Swiss company, because \"the U.S. ha[d] sanctions in place against Iran,\" and direct investment would therefore be \"problematic.\" Naseri, Reza Heidari, Mohammad Modares and Modanlo then went to Switzerland in April 2002 to work out the details of forming Prospect Telecom in order to conceal Iranian participation as an investor/lender in Modanlo's satellite telecommunications activities.  Between April and June 2002, Heidari, Mohammad Modares and Abdol Mehrdad established Prospect Telecom and opened a bank account in Switzerland in the name of Prospect Telecom.\n\nHeidari, Modares, and Mehrdad then caused $10 million to be wired into the Prospect Telecom bank account from numerous foreign accounts, including from China and Dubai, and then almost immediately wired the $10 million to Modanlo's NYSI account in Bowie, Maryland, in consideration for Modanlo\u2019s assistance to Iran and the Iranians in brokering the satellite agreement with Russia, and for NYSI providing telecommunications services in support of that agreement. Modanlo also had agreed that NYSI would assist in obtaining telecommunications service provider licenses for the owners of Prospect Telecom and for the benefit of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\nIn October 2005, as a result of the efforts of Modanlo and his conspirators, POLYOT launched Iran=s first-ever satellite, a remote sensing and telecommunications satellite from Russia.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2007, Modanlo made false statements and concealed information about the creation and ownership of Prospect Telecom during bankruptcy proceedings, including that Modanlo and co-conspirators had arranged for the formation of Prospect telecom to conceal Iranian involvement.\n\nUnited States Attorney Rod J. Rosenstein praised the HSI Baltimore, DCIS and IRS - Criminal Investigation for their work in the investigation.  Mr. Rosenstein thanked Assistant United States Attorneys David I. Salem and Stuart Berman, who prosecuted the case.\n\n",

            "article_text": "CHICAGO \u2014 John R. Lausch, Jr., United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, today announced progress in combatting violent crime through a series of targeted strategies as part of the Department of Justice\u2019s revitalized Project Safe Neighborhoods initiative.\n\nOne year ago, the Department of Justice announced the revitalization and enhancement of PSN, an evidence-based program that the Department made the centerpiece of its violent crime reduction strategy.\u00a0 In the Northern District of Illinois, U.S. Attorney Lausch has employed the enhanced PSN program to tackle the full spectrum of violent crime issues facing the district. \u00a0Northern District of Illinois prosecutors target criminal organizations, leading to prosecutions of complex RICO, narcotics, and drug trafficking enterprises.\u00a0 The PSN program also identifies criminals with the most violent backgrounds and removes them from the community through prosecution of individual violent crime, drug, and firearm possession cases. \u00a0Resources are also invested in local prevention and reentry programs that seek to implement lasting reductions in crime through community engagement.\n\n\u201cA fundamental duty of our government is to keep people safe, and one of our primary goals as federal prosecutors is to reduce violent crime, particularly in large urban areas like Chicago,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Lausch.\u00a0 \u201cAs part of DOJ\u2019s revitalized PSN program, we have worked closer than ever with federal, state, and local law enforcement partners to increase prosecutions of trigger-pullers, drug traffickers, carjackers, and those who illegally use and possess firearms.\u00a0 We will use every available federal law enforcement tool to reduce the unacceptable level of violent crime and help keep our citizens safe.\u201d\n\nThe PSN program has enabled the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office to sustain and expand upon its recent increase in the prosecution of violent crime and gun offenders.\u00a0 For example, during each of the last two fiscal years, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office has charged more federal firearms offenses than were charged in any prior fiscal year for more than a decade.\u00a0 Crime statistics from the Chicago Police Department (CPD) reveal significant reductions in violent crime in Chicago in the past year.\u00a0 Through Oct. 31, 2018, Chicago has seen 107 fewer murders (a reduction of 19%) and 387 fewer shootings (a reduction of 16%) compared to 2017.\n\n\u201cWhile we are making progress, we realize that a great deal of work remains to be done to attack our stubborn violent crime problem in Chicago,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Lausch.\n\nThrough enforcement actions and community partnerships, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office works to reduce violent crime and make neighborhoods safer for everyone.\n\nEnforcement Actions\n\nOver the past year, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office has worked tirelessly with its federal, state, and local law enforcement partners to investigate and prosecute criminal organizations and individuals who commit violent crime across the Chicago area.\u00a0 The office works closely with U.S. law enforcement agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) to investigate and prosecute violent offenders.\u00a0 Our key state and local partners in this effort include the Chicago Police Department (CPD), the Illinois State Police (ISP), the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC), the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, and numerous county and local police departments and municipalities throughout the district.\n\n\u201cThe thriving partnership we have with federal, state, and local law enforcement is essential to our collaborative efforts to combat violent crime,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Lausch.\u00a0 \u201cOur goal for the remainder of 2018 and into 2019 is to continue to bring to justice those offenders who commit drug, gun, and violent offenses in our neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nDuring the past year, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office has prosecuted hundreds of defendants for violent crimes, firearms offenses, and drug trafficking, including:\n\nRICO Prosecutions\n\nFirearm Trafficking and Firearm Theft Prosecutions\n\nCarjacking Prosecutions\n\nIllegal Possession of Firearm Prosecutions\n\nAs part of PSN, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office works directly with local police and state prosecutors to identify offenders in the most violent areas in our district, including neighborhoods on the west and south sides of Chicago.\u00a0 The office adopts many of these cases for federal prosecution.\u00a0 As noted above, over the past two years, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office has increased its prosecution of illegal possession of firearms cases.\u00a0 More than 195 individuals were charged with federal gun crimes in Fiscal Year 2018, according to preliminary data.\n\n\u201cIf you are a felon and you are caught with a gun in one of the high-crime neighborhoods in Chicago or elsewhere in the district, you should expect to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, and face the possibility of going to federal prison for a long time,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Lausch.\n\nExamples of felon-in-possession sentencings in federal court over the past year include:\n\nLast month, the Department of Justice announced that it is funding five additional violent crime prosecutors in the Northern District of Illinois.\u00a0 With these additional resources, U.S. Attorney Lausch is creating aGun Crimes Prosecution Teamto enhance the prosecution of illegal firearm cases in certain police districts in Chicago. \u00a0Working collaboratively with federal and local law enforcement, the new unit will focus on charging Chicago\u2019s most dangerous criminals quickly after arrest, endeavoring to disrupt the cycle\u00a0of violence in the\u00a0neighborhoods\u00a0most in need.\n\n\u201cWe welcome the additional resources from the Department of Justice to strengthen our efforts to reduce violent crime,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Lausch.\n\nNarcotics Trafficking Prosecutions\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office targets traffickers who bring illegal drugs into Illinois from other states or countries, with a particular focus on traffickers who use guns, violence and threats of violence to protect and promote their illegal businesses.\u00a0 The office also investigates and prosecutes large-scale dealers who distribute powerful opioids like fentanyl and heroin.\u00a0 Many of these investigations are conducted by OCDETF and HIDTA task forces, which involve teams of law enforcement agents and officers from multiple federal agencies and police departments working together to combat drug trafficking and its attendant violent crime in the Chicago area.\u00a0 In addition, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office often works directly with the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office to ensure that individuals selling drugs on the streets are charged with appropriate offenses in either federal or state court.\n\nRecent examples of federal narcotics prosecutions include:\n\nCommunity Partnerships\n\nThe revitalized PSN program continues to invest resources in many violence-prevention initiatives.\u00a0 Members of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office participate in parolee forums and youth outreach forums.\n\nThe monthly parolee forums, also known as offender notification meetings, rotate among various Chicago neighborhoods.\u00a0 Recent parolees who have moved back into the neighborhoods are offered the chance to make an informed choice not to engage in further criminal activity.\u00a0 Researchers at Yale University found that ex-offenders who attend a forum are30% less likely to commit a new offensethan those who did not attend a forum.\n\nThe quarterly youth forums assist children aged 13-17 to identify a path other than gang membership.\u00a0 The youth forums are conducted in partnership with CPD, the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center, and the University of Chicago Crime Lab, which tracks the progress of the children to assess results.\n\n~~~\n\nTo learn more about Project Safe Neighborhoods, visithttps://www.justice.gov/psn.",

            "article_text": "CHARLOTTESVILLE, VIRGINIA \u2013 The three Charlottesville residents accused of producing tens of thousands of fraudulent driver\u2019s licenses and shipping them across the country pled guilty this morning in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia in Charlottesville.\n\nAlan McNeil Jones, 31, Kelly Erin McPhee, 31, and Mark Guerin Bernardo, 34, all of Charlottesville, Va., waived their rights to be indicted and pled guilty this morning to a two-count Information. The three defendants each pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit identification document fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft.\n\n\u201cThese three defendants developed a sophisticated scheme to produce and sell high-quality false identification documents throughout the nation,\u201d United States Attorney Timothy J. Heaphy said today. \u201cTheir criminal enterprise was tremendously lucrative, generating profits of more than $3 million over several years. By producing and distributing these fraudulent identification documents, Mr. Jones and his co-conspirators endangered national security. Law enforcement personnel involved in this case will take every available step to recover these counterfeit driver\u2019s licenses and ensure that they cannot be used to facilitate additional criminal activity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe defendants in this case primarily used the U.S. Mail to facilitate their criminal scheme. Postal Inspectors were able to quickly identify the scheme and worked aggressively with our partnering law enforcement agencies and the U.S. Attorney's Office to locate the subjects involved and ultimately dismantle their criminal enterprise. Through cases like these, the Postal Inspection Service upholds it's long standing mission of protecting the public and preventing criminal misuse of the U.S. Mail,\u201d said Keith A. Fixel, Inspector in Charge, U.S. Postal Inspection Service - Charlotte Division.\n\n\u201cRegardless of the reasons for seeking fraudulent documents, U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) strives to detect, deter and disrupt individuals and organizations that present an active threat to national security or public safety, and who seek to undermine the integrity of the laws and regulations of the United States,\u201d said Scot Rittenberg, Acting Special Agent in Charge, Washington. D.C. Field Office.\n\nToday in District Court, Jones, McPhee and Bernardo admitted to conspiring to created high-quality fraudulent driver\u2019s licenses out of the home they shared on Rugby Road in Charlottesville, Va. The conspiracy, which began in 2010 and operated under the name Novel Design, produced and sold more than 25,000 fraudulent driver\u2019s licenses, primarily to college students, throughout the nation.\n\nAs part of the scheme, Jones paid commissions to students at the University of Virginia, and elsewhere, to refer his service to other students interested in obtaining fraudulent driver\u2019s licenses. He also outsourced some of the manufacturing work to companies in Bangladesh and China.\n\nDuring the entire period of time in which Novel Design was in operation, Jones, McPhee and Bernardo produced approximately 25,000 fraudulent driver\u2019s licenses for customers. They charged anywhere from $75 to $125 per fake license and the three obtained more than $3 million from customers. To date, over $2.7 million in assets have been seized by law enforcement.\n\nAt the height of the conspiracy, Jones, McPhee and Bernardo, were able to create fraudulent driver\u2019s licenses for the states of Arizona, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.\n\nAt sentencing, each defendant faces a maximum possible penalty of up to 15 years in federal prison on the conspiracy charge and a mandatory additional two-year sentence on the aggravated identify theft charge.\n\nThe investigation of the case was conducted by the Department of Homeland Security Investigations, the United States Postal Inspection Service and the Virginia State Police. Assisting in the investigation was the Homeland Security Investigations Laboratory, the United States Postal Inspection Service Laboratory, US Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Albemarle County Police Department, The Charlottesville Police Department, the State Attorney General\u2019s Office for the Commonwealth of Virginia, the United States Secret Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the College of Charleston, the Texas Highway Patrol and the University of Virginia Police. United States Attorney Timothy J. Heaphy and Assistant United States Attorney Ronald Huber are prosecuting the case for the United States.",

            "article_text": "LOS ANGELES\u2013 A Woodland Hills man pleaded guilty today to federal criminal charges in connection with a scheme where Chinese nationals fraudulently obtained student visas by hiring people with fake Chinese passports to take an English proficiency test on their behalf.\n\nLiu Cai, 24, pleaded guilty to two felony counts of using a false passport. United States District Judge John A. Kronstadt scheduled a February 13, 2020, sentencing hearing, at which time Cai will face a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison.\n\nCai is the lead defendant in a 26-count federal grand jury indictment returned in March, charging six defendants with conspiring to use false passports, using false passports, and aggravated identity theft, as part of the scheme to impersonate Chinese nationals who were required to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) to obtain a student visa.\n\nAccording to his plea agreement, in March 2015 and October 2016, Cai knowingly and willfully used counterfeit passports of the People\u2019s Republic of China, furnishing them to proctors of the TOEFL exam. Cai admitted that he took the TOEFL exams on behalf of two Chinese nationals who sought to enter and remain in the United States on student visas.\n\nCai further admitted that he belonged to a network of U.S. citizens and permanent residents that were paid to impersonate TOEFL examinees. Cai impersonated a Chinese national on at least five occasions between March 2015 and October 2016, according to his plea agreement. Because of Cai\u2019s conduct, college applicants fraudulently entered and remained in the United States on fraudulently obtained student visas, the plea agreement states.\n\nThe United States requires foreign citizens who wish to enter the United States on a temporary basis to study at a college or university to first obtain an F-1 student visa. To obtain a student visa, foreign citizens must first apply to study at a school that has been authorized by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) to enroll foreign students. In the United States, SEVP-certified schools require foreign citizens whose first language is not English to certify proficiency in English by achieving a particular score on the TOEFL.\n\nWhen the foreign national goes to a TOEFL testing location, the test taker must present an original, non-expired, government-issued identification document recognized by their home country.\n\nAll of Cai\u2019s co-defendants \u2013 Quang Cao, 24, of San Francisco; Elric Zhang, 25, of Los Angeles; Mohan Zhang, 24, of Cerritos; Samantha Wang, 25, of Corona, and Tuan Tran, 33, of Taiwan \u2013 have pleaded guilty to criminal charges in this case and are scheduled to be sentenced in the coming months.\n\nThis case was by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations, the State Department\u2019s Diplomatic Security Service, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service\u2019s Fraud Detection National Security Section. The Educational Testing Service, which administers the TOEFL exam, has provided assistance during the investigation.\n\nThis matter is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Gabriel J.

            "article_text": "Note:View the affidavit here.\n\nThe Justice Department today announced a court-authorized law enforcement operation that disrupted a botnet consisting of more than 200,000 consumer devices in the United States and worldwide. As described in court documents unsealed in the Western District of Pennsylvania, the botnet devices were infected by People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) state-sponsored hackers working for Integrity Technology Group, a company based in Beijing, and known to the private sector as \u201cFlax Typhoon.\u201d\n\nThe botnet malware infected numerous types of consumer devices, including small-office/home-office (SOHO) routers, internet protocol (IP) cameras, digital video recorders (DVRs), and network-attached storage (NAS) devices. The malware connected these thousands of infected devices into a botnet, controlled by Integrity Technology Group, which was used to conduct malicious cyber activity disguised as routine internet traffic from the infected consumer devices. The court-authorized operation took control of the hackers\u2019 computer infrastructure and, among other steps, sent disabling commands through that infrastructure to the malware on the infected devices. During the course of the operation, there was an attempt to interfere with the FBI\u2019s remediation efforts through a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack targeting the operational infrastructure that the FBI was utilizing to effectuate the court\u2019s orders. That attack was ultimately unsuccessful in preventing the FBI\u2019s disruption of the botnet.\n\n\u201cThe Justice Department is zeroing in on the Chinese government backed hacking groups that target the devices of innocent Americans and pose a serious threat to our national security,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \u201cAs we did earlier this year, the Justice Department has again destroyed a botnet used by PRC-backed hackers to infiltrate consumer devices here in the United States and around the world. We will continue to aggressively counter the threat that China\u2019s state- sponsored hacking groups pose to the American people.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur takedown of this state-sponsored botnet reflects the Department\u2019s all-tools approach to disrupting cyber criminals. This network, managed by a PRC government contractor, hijacked hundreds of thousands of private routers, cameras, and other consumer devices to create a malicious system for the PRC to exploit,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. \u201cToday should serve as a warning to cybercriminals preying on Americans \u2013 if you continue to come for us, we will come for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis dynamic operation demonstrates, once again, the Justice Department\u2019s resolve in countering the threats posed by PRC state-sponsored hackers,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the National Security Division. \u201cFor thesecond timethis year, we have disrupted a botnet used by PRC proxies to conceal their efforts to hack into networks in the U.S. and around the world to steal information and hold our infrastructure at risk.\u00a0Our message to these hackers is clear:\u00a0if you build it, we will bust it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe disruption of this worldwide botnet is part of the FBI\u2019s commitment to using technical operations to help protect victims, expose publicly the scope of these criminal hacking campaigns, and to use the adversary\u2019s tools against them to remove malicious infrastructure from the virtual battlefield,\u201d said FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate. \u201cThe FBI\u2019s unique legal authorities allowed it to lead an international operation with partners that collectively disconnected this botnet from its China-based hackers at Integrity Technology Group.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe targeted hacking of hundreds of thousands of innocent victims in the United States and around the world shows the breadth and aggressiveness of PRC state-sponsored hackers,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Eric G. Olshan for the Western District of Pennsylvania. \u201cThis court-authorized operation disrupted a sophisticated botnet designed to steal sensitive information and launch disruptive cyber attacks. We will continue to work with our partners inside and outside government, using every tool at our disposal, to defend and maintain global cybersecurity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe FBI\u2019s investigation revealed that a publicly-traded, China-based company is openly selling its customers the ability to hack into and control thousands of consumer devices worldwide. This operation sends a clear message to the PRC that the United States will not tolerate this shameless criminal conduct,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Stacey Moy of the FBI San Diego Field Office.\n\nAccording to the court documents, the botnet was developed and controlled by Integrity Technology Group, a publicly-traded company headquartered in Beijing. The company built an online application allowing its customers to log in and control specified infected victim devices, including with a menu of malicious cyber commands using a tool called \u201cvulnerability-arsenal.\u201d The online application was prominently labelled \u201cKRLab,\u201d one of the main public brands used by Integrity Technology Group.\n\nThe FBI assesses that Integrity Technology Group, in addition to developing and controlling the botnet, is responsible for computer intrusion activities attributed to China-based hackers known by the private sector as \u201cFlax Typhoon.\u201d Microsoft Threat Intelligence describedFlax Typhoonas nation-state actors based out of China, active since 2021, who have targeted government agencies and education, critical manufacturing, and information technology organizations in Taiwan, and elsewhere. The FBI\u2019s investigation has corroborated Microsoft\u2019s conclusions, finding that Flax Typhoon has successfully attacked multiple U.S. and foreign corporations, universities, government agencies, telecommunications providers, and media organizations.\n\nA cybersecurity advisory describing Integrity Technology Group tactics, techniques and procedures was alsopublishedtoday by the FBI, the National Security Agency, U.S. Cyber Command\u2019s Cyber National Mission Force, and partner agencies in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe government\u2019s malware disabling commands, which interacted with the malware\u2019s native functionality, were extensively tested prior to the operation. As expected, the operation did not affect the legitimate functions of, or collect content information from, the infected devices. The FBI is providing notice to U.S. owners of devices that were affected by this court-authorized operation. The FBI is contacting those victims through their internet service provider, who will provide notice to their customers.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s San Diego Field Office and Cyber Division, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania, and the National Security Cyber Section of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division led the domestic disruption effort. Assistance was also provided by the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section. These efforts would not have been successful without the collaboration of partners, including French authorities, andLumen Technologies\u2019threat intelligence group, Black Lotus Labs, which first identified and described this botnet, which it named Raptor Train, in July 2023.\n\nIf you believe you have a compromised computer or device, please visit theFBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3)orreport online to CISA. You may also contact your local FBI field office directly.\n\nThe FBI continues to investigate Integrity Technology Group\u2019s and Flax Typhoon\u2019s computer intrusion activities.",

            "article_text": "Three Florida residents have been charged in federal district court in Miami with crimes related to their alleged violations of U.S. sanctions on Iran, and money laundering.\n\nDefendants Mohammad Faghihi, 52, his wife Farzeneh Modarresi, 53, and his sister Faezeh Faghihi, 50, operated Florida company Express Gene. According to the criminal complaint affidavit, between October 2016 and November 2020, Express Gene received numerous wire transfers from accounts in Malaysia, the People\u2019s Republic of China, Singapore, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates, totaling almost $3.5 million. It is alleged that some of the money received was used by Express Gene and its principals to purchase genetic sequencing equipment from U.S. manufacturers and ship them to Iran without a license from the Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to export the machines, despite sanctions on Iran. The incoming money also was used by F. Faghihi and Modarresi to fund the 2019 purchase of the Express Gene property, says the affidavit.\n\nOn Feb. 20, Faghihi arrived at Miami International Airport from Iran, where he was inspected by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers. According to the charging documents, during his inspection by CBP officers, Faghihi made false statements, including that he did not practice his profession in Iran or conduct any type of research in Iran. In fact, according to the affidavit, Faghihi was the director of a laboratory within Shiraz University of Medical Science in Iran bearing his name: \u201cDr. Faghihi\u2019s Medical Genetic Center,\u201d. In addition, his luggage contained 17 vials of unknown biological substances covered with ice packs and concealed beneath bread and other food items, according to the affidavit. All the vials were subject to regulations.\n\nFrom approximately 2013 to approximately 2020, Faghihi was an Assistant Professor at the Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences at the University of Miami (UM), Miller School of Medicine. During this period, he was the principal investigator on several National Institute of Health (NIH) grants awarded in February 2013, December 2016 and June 2017. It is alleged that Express Gene and Faghihi received large deposits from international wires during this period, but they were not disclosed as required to either UM or NIH\u2019s financial conflict of interest reporting system.\n\nDefendants made their initial federal court appearances today. Their pretrial detention hearings will take place tomorrow, Sept. 15, at 10:00 a.m. in federal magistrate court in Miami.\n\nAll defendants are charged with conspiring to commit an offense against the United States and conspiring to commit money laundering. Faghihi and Modarresi are also charged with the unlawful exports of goods to Iran, and smuggling goods out of the United States. Faghihi and F. Faghihi were charged with smuggling goods into the United States and making false statements. Faghihi is further charged with wire fraud.\n\nActing Assistant Attorney General Mark J. Lesko for the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division; Acting U.S. Attorney Juan Antonio Gonzalez for the Southern District of Florida; Special Agent in Charge George Piro of the FBI\u2019s Miami Field Office; and Director Vernon Foret of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Miami Field Office made the announcement.\n\nFBI Miami and CBP Miami are investigating the case. The University of Miami provided invaluable assistance.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Michael Thakur and Senior Litigation Counsel Randy Hummel of the Southern District of Florida and Trial Attorney Menno Goedman of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting the case.\n\nA criminal complaint is merely an allegation, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.",

            "article_text": "United States Attorney Leigha Simonton will resign from the Department of Justice effective Jan. 19, the office announced today.\n\n\u201cI began my career in this office as a summer intern after my first year of law school,\u201d said Ms. Simonton.\u00a0 \u201cIt was love at first sight.\u00a0 Every day after that internship, I was figuring out how to become an Assistant U.S. Attorney here.\u00a0 I got that chance when I was nine months pregnant with my first child\u2014a baby who is now 20 years old.\u00a0 I am so proud to have served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for almost eighteen years and then to have been chosen to lead this district\u2014comprised of 100 counties and over 8 million people\u2014as the United States Attorney.\u00a0 I cannot put into words what this experience has meant to me, and I leave with two decades of incredible memories.\u00a0 There is nothing more important than the work of our outstanding women and men in this office and in North Texas law enforcement, and I will be forever grateful to have been a part of it.\u201d\n\nNominated by President Joseph R. Biden on Nov. 14, 2022\u00a0and unanimously\u00a0confirmed by the U.S. Senate on Dec. 6, 2022, Ms. Simonton was sworn in as United States Attorney for the Northern District of Texas on Dec. 10, 2022.(Download a high-res version of her headshothere.)\n\nUnder her leadership, the district has fought relentlessly for justice, trying its highest number of cases in over a decade. Ms. Simonton actively supervised several high-profile jury trials, from Dr. Raynaldo Ortiz, the anesthesiologistconvictedof injecting heart-stopping drugs into patient IV bags, to Christopher Kirchner, the Slync founderfound guiltyof defrauding investors out of more than $25 million, to Holly Elkins, the womanconvictedof\u00a0helping her fianc\u00e9 cyberstalk and ultimately murder his former girlfriend and mother of his child.\u00a0 She also oversaw thechargingof a Russian national for using the BitPaymer ransomware variant to attack numerous victims throughout the United States and thesentencingof a Ukrainian national for demanding over $700 million in ransom payments using the REvil ransomware variant.\u00a0 Other notable cases included charges against 14 individuals in\u00a0thelargest case investigated by the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee Fraud Task Force to datefor allegedly bilking the Paycheck Protection Program and numerous financial institutions out of more than $53 million,chargesagainst\u00a0a Texas Christian University divinity professor for possessing child pornography, thesentencingof a retired Cook Children\u2019s Hospital Chaplain for producing child pornography, thesentencingof a would-be bomber who idolized the Columbine High school shooters, and thesentencingof another man who set off a bomb in his backyard and plotted to blow up a high school.\n\nDuring her tenure, Ms. Simonton also oversaw the prosecution of 11 drug traffickers charged in the wake of thejuvenile fentanyl overdose scandal, which claimed the lives of four Carrollton-area middle and high schoolers and injured 10 more.\u00a0 In the wake of these tragedies, Ms. Simonton launched the \u201cProtect Our Children Project,\u201d aimed at bringing federal resources to bear on issues affecting schools, including fentanyl use.\u00a0 She hosted a series of webinars for hundreds of North Texas school administrators that covered the dangers of fentanyl, how to respond to an overdose, and how to discourage teens from using the drug.\u00a0 She also visited several area colleges to share the dangers of fentanyl with young adults.\u00a0 And, last summer, along with the other Texas U.S. Attorneys, she met in Austin with the heads of all Texas regional education service centers to provide important information and resources on fentanyl that they could use in Texas public schools.\n\nMs. Simonton also focused on curbing violent crime in North Texas, and the violent crime ratefellin major North Texas cities during that time.\u00a0She prioritized prosecution of violent recidivists and launchedOperation Take Aimin the summer of 2023 to further target such offenders.\u00a0 And she partnered with the other Texas U.S. Attorneys and the ATF in the summer of 2024 to launch \u201cOperation Texas Kill Switch,\u201d a statewide initiative to combat the illegal use of machine gun conversion devices, also known as \"switches.\u201d\u00a0 The operation, which included a partnership with CrimeStoppers, raised public awareness of the dangers of switches, generated multiple tips, and resulted in numerous ongoing prosecutions.\n\nThe Civil and Appellate Divisions also thrived under Ms. Simonton\u2019s stewardship. Ms. Simonton oversaw the creation and implementation of the district\u2019s newVoluntary Self-Disclosure policy, incentivizing companies to quickly detect, disclose, and remediate suspected misconduct, and negotiated settlements in several self-disclosure cases.\u00a0 For instance, the Civil Division negotiated a$14.2 million settlementwith Horizon Medical Center of Denton for potential violations of Medicare regulations and the physician self-referral law and an$18.4 million settlementwith Consolidated Nuclear Security LLC (CNS) after CNS self-disclosed that it submitted false claims for payment to the National Nuclear Security Administration related to the Pantex Plant\u2014the nation\u2019s primary facility for the assembly, disassembly, and retrofitting of nuclear weapons.\u00a0 Further, the Civil Division negotiated a $4.5 million settlement with a 3D printing company that allegedlytransmitted technical datato China in violation of export control laws and obtained $1.2 million in judgments against two doctors whoprescribed hydrocodoneto drug-seekers without legitimate medical purpose.\n\nMeanwhile, under her leadership, the Appellate Division persuaded the Fifth Circuit to affirm the life sentence of a Michigan man whostalked, transported, and sexually assaulted a 14-year-old girl, convinced the Fifth Circuit that a retrial in the Ruel Hamiltonreal estate bribery casewould not violate double jeopardy, and successfully defended against 19 issues on appeal arising from the Forest Park Medical Centerkickback case. \u00a0The Appellate Division also successfully defended the conviction of fourUDF executiveswho misled investors and the SEC about their investment fund\u2019s performance; the Fifth Circuit upheld the conviction, citing the government\u2019s \u201cavalanche of evidence\u201d proving its case, and the Supreme Court laterdenied cert, allowing the Fifth Circuit decision to stand.\n\nMs. Simonton also oversaw the progress of theU.S. v. Rahimicase\u2014charged in the Northern District of Texas\u2014through the Fifth Circuit to the U.S. Supreme Court.\u00a0 She supported the Solicitor General\u2019s efforts seeking certiorari of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision invalidating Rahimi\u2019s conviction for using a firearm while under a domestic violence protection order.\u00a0After the Supreme Court granted cert, she attended the oral argument as a guest of the Solicitor General, and the Supreme Court later decided 8-1 that Rahimi\u2019s statute of conviction was constitutional under the Second Amendment.\u00a0TheRahimicase originated from the Northern District of Texas\u2019sDomestic Violence Initiative, which targets domestic abusers for federal prosecution and resulted, during Ms. Simonton\u2019s tenure, in cases such as thesentencingof a San Diego man to life in prison for traveling to Texas and killing his boyfriend, and thesentencingof a felon domestic abuser to 10 years in prison for violating his supervised release by attacking his partner.\u00a0 As U.S. Attorney, Ms. Simonton has been an outspoken advocate for domestic violence awareness, partnering with regional and national domestic violence organizations, holding press conferences with the other Texas U.S. Attorneys to honor Texas domestic violence victims, and sharing resources with other U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices so they can create their own domestic abuser prosecution programs.\n\nThroughout her time in office, Ms. Simonton and her staff actively supported other especially vulnerable communities, including religious communities.\u00a0 She held hate-crime seminars for Jewish and Muslim community leaders and oversaw hate-crimes prosecutions that resulted in thesentencingof a Dallas man to 37 years after he shot five individuals, killing one, at a tire shop because it was a Muslim-owned business, and thesentencingof an Amarillo man for threatening to execute three Jewish rabbis.\n\nMs. Simonton further attempted to stem the tide of defendants who make their way into the federal system, revitalizing and expanding the district\u2019s Project Safe Neighborhood Re-Entry Night program, which educates individuals on state parole and probation about avoiding behaviors, like drug trafficking and gun possession, that could end up in federal prosecution, and connects them with community resources\u2014like therapy, addiction, and job placement programs\u2014to live productive lives.\u00a0 During her tenure, thousands of such individuals across the district attended these programs, and the vast majority have not reoffended.\u00a0 Further, Ms. Simonton and her staff created events to foster positive relationships between residents of high-crime communities and the law enforcement officers who serve them, such as adopting neighborhood schools, holding book fairs staffed by U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office personnel and law enforcement officers, and having officers read books to preschoolers via the office\u2019s \u201cPre-K Reading Program.\u201d\n\nAfter a brief hiatus, Ms. Simonton anticipates likely reentering private practice, and she plans to continue to advocate for domestic-violence victims and to protect children and young adults from the harms of fentanyl and other threats to their health and safety.\u00a0 An Acting U.S. Attorney will be announced at a later date.",

According to the complaint, Gong sought funding from the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC)-administered \u201cTalent Programs,\u201d which recruit individuals overseas with expertise sought after by the PRC, to develop similar technology.\n\nIn May 2023, Liming Li of California wasarrestedfor his alleged theft of sensitive technology related to advanced manufacturing software programs from his Southern-California-based employers and using that information to market his own competing company to businesses in China.\n\nIn May 2023, California man and former Apple employee Weibao Wang waschargedin connection with a scheme to steal Apple source code and other proprietary information related to autonomous systems. Allegedly, he left Apple to work as an engineer for a U.S.-based subsidiary of a China-based company to work on the development of self-driving cars, and, following a search of his residence, Wang left the country for China.\n\nIn December 2023, Belgian national Hans Maria De Geetere waschargedand arrested in Belgium for crimes related to a years-long scheme to export accelerometers used in aerospace and military systems from the United States to end users in China.\n\nThree cases charged individuals with seeking to procure sensitive U.S. technology on behalf of the government of Iran or Iranian end users.\n\nIn February 2024, Iranian national Abolfazi Bazzazi and his son Mohammad Resa Bazzazi werechargedwith violating U.S. sanctions by procuring for the Government of Iran and other Iranian ends users goods and technology from U.S. companies that supply the military, aerospace, and firefighting industries.\n\nIn January 2023, four Chinese nationals, Baoxia Liu, You Wa Yung, Yongxin Li, and Yanlai Zhong, werechargedwith smuggling U.S.-origin items used in the production of UAVs and ballistic missile systems through Chinese front companies to Iranian entities with ties to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Ministry of Defense.\n\nIn May 2023, Chinese national Xiangjiang Qiao waschargedwith multiple offenses related to a scheme to use a sanctioned Chinese company to provide high-tech materials used in the production of weapons of mass destruction to Iran, in exchange for payments made through the U.S. financial system.\n\nSecured the guilty plea of a defendant charged for her role in a multimillion-dollar scheme to send electronic components used in UAVs and guided missile systems and other weapons to sanctioned entities in Russia.\n\nIn February 2024, Canadian national Kristina Puzyreva, one of three defendants charged in the case,pleaded guiltyto money laundering conspiracy as part of a sophisticated sanctions and export control scheme involving two Brooklyn-based companies.\n\nIssued Temporary Denial Orders against 29 entities, including airlines, freight forwarders, defense companies, and others to cut off their access to controlled U.S. items.\n\nContributed to numerous parties being placed on Commerce\u2019s Entity List and Treasury\u2019s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List.\n\nForged international partnerships committed to preventing critical technology from being siphoned off by foreign adversaries.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen and Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement Matthew Axelrodtraveled to Kyivin November 2023, following prior visits by the Attorney General to Ukraine, to reaffirm the Strike Force\u2019s close partnership with the Ukrainian Prosecutor General and commitment to curbing the illegal flow of advanced technology to Russia.\n\nFollowing the Camp David Leaders\u2019 Summit with President Biden and the leaders of Japan and Korea, DOJ and Commerce took steps to establish aDisruptive Technology Protection Networkwith South Korea and Japan to expand collaboration on technology protection measures, including expanding information-sharing and the exchange of best practices across the three countries\u2019 enforcement agencies.\n\nAs part of the Munich Security Conference, Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen and Assistant Secretary Matthew Axelrod participated in a panel discussion on safeguarding disruptive technology in a new era of economic statecraft.\n\nDuring aspeechin the United Kingdom, where she announced the creation of the Strike Force in February 2023, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco deliveredremarksabout the national security risks posed by artificial intelligence and why it is a top enforcement priority for the Strike Force.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen deliveredremarksand participated in a roundtable discussion hosted by the American Academy at the U.S. embassy in Berlin, Germany. \u00a0Throughout the visit, AAG Olsen reaffirmed the Department\u2019s close partnership with foreign counterparts to stop the flow of sensitive technology to foreign adversaries.\n\nAssistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Enforcement Matthew Axelroddelivered remarkson international partnerships, with a focus on the Strike Force, at the Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control-Bureau of Industry and Security Export Control Forum in Frankfurt, Germany.\n\n\n\nFostered partnerships with the private sector, working directly with companies involved in the manufacture, sale, and shipment of sensitive export-controlled items.\n\nToured the largest and third-largest commercial ports in the United States\n\nAdded new interagency partners to the effort and enforcement teams to the Strike Force.",

            "article_text": "BOSTON \u2013 Additional charges were filed on Tuesday, Oct. 30, 2018, against a Chinese national in connection with violating export laws by conspiring with, among others, employees of an entity affiliated with the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) in China to illegally export U.S. origin goods to China.\n\nShuren Qin, a Chinese national residing in Wellesley, was charged in a superseding indictment yesterday with conspiracy to defraud the United States, smuggling, money laundering and making false statements to government officials. These charges are in addition to previous charges filed, including conspiracy to commit export violations, visa fraud, and conspiracy to defraud the United States. Qin was released on conditions pending trial.\n\nAccording to court documents, Qin was born in the People\u2019s Republic of China and became a lawful permanent resident of the United States in 2014. Qin operates several companies in China, including a company called LinkOcean Technologies, which imports goods and technology with underwater and marine applications to China from the United States, Canada and Europe. The indictment alleges that Qin communicated with and received taskings from entities affiliated with the PLA, including Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU), a Chinese military research institute, to obtain items used for anti-submarine warfare. In 2001, the Department of Commerce designated NWPU on its Entity List because of the national security risks NWPU poses to the United States. As described in the indictment, NWPU has worked closely with the PLA on the advancement of its military capabilities.\n\nBetween approximately July 2015 and December 2016, it is alleged that Qin exported at least 60 hydrophones (devices used to detect and monitor sound underwater) from the United States to NWPU without obtaining the required export licenses from the Department of Commerce.\u00a0 Qin and his company, LinkOcean, did so by concealing from the U.S. manufacturer of the hydrophones that NWPU was the true end-user and by causing false end-user information to be filed with the U.S. Government. In addition, on four separate occasions in connection with the export of hydrophones to NWPU, Qin allegedly engaged in money laundering by transferring or causing the transfer of more than $100,000 from Chinese bank accounts to bank accounts located in the United States with the intent to promote and facilitate his unlawful export scheme.\n\nIn 2014, it is alleged that Qin engaged in visa fraud in connection with his application to become a lawful permanent U.S. resident by falsely certifying that he was not seeking to \u201cengage in export control violations or other unlawful activity\u201d when, in fact, he engaged in numerous violations of U.S. export laws between 2012 and 2018 both in China and in the United States. Qin has also been charged with making false statements to government agents on two occasions regarding LinkOcean\u2019s customers and its export activities. Specifically, the indictment alleges that during an interview with Customs and Boarder Protection (CBP) Officers in November 2017, Qin stated that he only exported instruments that attach to a buoy. However, Qin allegedly exported remotely-operated side scan sonar systems, unmanned underwater vehicles, unmanned surface vehicles, robotic boats, and hydrophones. The items that Qin failed to disclose to, and concealed from, CBP during this interview have military applications, and several of these items were delivered to military end-users in China. For instance, Qin exported a U.S.-manufactured remotely-operated side scan sonar system to a PLA Troop in November 2015. Qin also lied to investigators during an interview on or about June 21, 2018, when he stated that he did not have any customers on the Department of Commerce\u2019s Entity List. In fact, the indictment alleges that Qin and LinkOcean had at least two such customers.\n\nThe charge of conspiring to violate U.S. export laws provides for a sentence of no greater than 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $1 million. The charge of visa fraud provides for a sentence of no greater than 10 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000. The charge of conspiring to defraud the United States provides for a sentence of no greater than five years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a $250,000 fine. The charge of making false statements provides for a sentence of no greater five years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a $250,000 fine.\u00a0 The charge or money laundering provides for a sentence of no greater than 20 years in prison, five years of supervised release, and a $500,000 fine. The charge of smuggling provides for a sentence of no greater than 10 years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a $250,000 fine.\u00a0 Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nUnited States Attorney Andrew Lelling; Peter C. Fitzhugh, Special Agent in Charge of the Homeland Security Investigation, Boston Field Office; Leigh Alistair-Barzey, Special Agent in Charge of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, Northeast Field Office; William Higgins, Acting Special Agent in Charge of the Department of Commerce, Office of Export Enforcement, Boston Field Office; Harold H. Shaw, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Boston Field Division; and Leo Lamont, Special Agent in Charge of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, Northeast Field Office made the announcement today. Assistant U.S. Attorney B. Stephanie Siegmann, Chief of Lelling\u2019s National Security Unit, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason Casey, also of National Security Unit, are prosecuting the case.\n\nThe details contained in the indictment are allegations. The defendant is presumed to be innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.",

            "article_text": "LOS ANGELES\u2013 A Los Angeles art dealer has been sentenced to 18 months in federal prison for conspiring to smuggle looted archeological resources into the United States, and then using those antiquities as the basis of a charitable donation tax fraud scheme involving local museums.\n\nJonathan M. Markell, 70, a resident of the Westchester district of Los Angeles and who is the owner of Silk Roads Design Gallery (which previously was located on North La Brea Avenue and now operates in the Jefferson Park district of Los Angeles), was sentenced Monday afternoon by United States District Judge Dean D. Pregerson, who called Markell\u2019s crimes \u201csignificant.\u201d\n\nIn issuing the prison sentence, Judge Pregerson said it was \u201cimportant to send a message\u201d to art collectors, gallery owners and museums that they should avoid collecting and trading looted antiquities.\n\nMarkell previously pleaded guilty to conspiring to smuggle stolen antiquities into the United States by making false declarations to U.S. Customs authorities. In a second case, Markell pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit tax fraud. Markell admitted smuggling antiquities from Burma, Thailand, Cambodia and China into the United States for sale in his art gallery. Markell knew that many of the antiquities had been looted from the site of an ancient civilization located in Ban Chiang, Thailand \u2013 which the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has designated this site as a \u201cWorld Heritage\u201d site. An expert on Southeast Asian archaeology testified in court on Monday that the looting of the Ban Chiang sites \u2013 which are thousands of years old \u2013 to supply galleries like Markell\u2019s was \u201cdevastating to the archeology of Thailand.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Markell\u2019s greed placed his art gallery\u2019s profits above the culture and heritage of the people of Thailand,\u201d said United States Attorney Eileen M. Decker. \u201cNot only did he play a significant role in the international trade of looted artifacts, Markell also participated in a scheme designed to illegally provide tax deductions to art collectors.\u201d\n\nOnce in possession of the looted antiquities in the United States, Markell engaged in a tax fraud scheme by promoting and participating in a false charitable deduction scheme. After obtaining the Thai antiquities, most of which were from the Ban Chiang culture, Markell bundled the antiquities into \u201ccharitable donation packages\u201d that were donated to charitable institutions such as museums and universities. Markell prepared fraudulent appraisals in order to falsely inflate the value of the antiquities, which he provided to co-conspirators, who used the fraudulent documents to claim inflated charitable donation tax deductions.\n\nMarkell\u2019s wife, 68-year old Carolyn Markell, was also sentenced Monday afternoon for her role in the tax fraud conspiracy. In addition to being ordered to pay restitution to the Internal Revenue Service for fraudulent tax deductions, she and her husband were also ordered to repatriate 337 antiquities seized from their residence and gallery to Thailand, Burma, Cambodia and China.\n\n\u201cIt is individuals such as Jonathan Markell \u2013 the importers, the buyers and the gallery owners who purchase and acquire such archeological resources or wildlife products for profitable resale who are primarily to blame for the underlying devastation, for these are the individuals who create the markets that create the monetary incentives that drive the poachers and looters into the field,\u201d prosecutors wrote in a sentencing memorandum filed with the court.\n\nThis case was investigated by the National Park Service, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u2013 Homeland Security Investigation, and IRS Criminal Investigation.",

Hamdani.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office (USAO) along with FBI, Homeland Security Investigations, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the Food and Drug Administration provided the training which included essential tools and protocols for TMC attendees to follow if their facilities are subject to cyber intrusions.\n\nMethodist Hospital hosted the training event with attendees from Memorial Herman Hospital, Texas Children\u2019s Hospital, MD Anderson, Baylor College of Medicine and the University of Texas Health System.\n\nCriminal organizations and nation state actors like China, Russia and Iran as well as other bad actors have become more sophisticated in their ability to launch cyber-attacks against critical infrastructure such as the health care facilities in the TMC.\n\n\u201cIt is essential to national security and crucial to the safety of patients for federal law enforcement to work closely with the health care sector to develop resilient and adaptive defenses against malicious cyberspace activity and network intrusions,\u201d said Hamdani. \u201cThe USAO will continue to seek opportunities to enhance collaboration with our law enforcement partners and the health care industry to prevent potential network intrusions and ensure greater unity of effort in response to cyber incidents.\u201d\n\nOn a weekly basis, hundreds of cyberattacks occur on businesses all across the Southern District of Texas. There must be a quick response team in place to immediately address the intrusion in order to circumvent major damage and losses.\u00a0The USAO routinely works with other prosecutors and law enforcement in the district to stay ahead of potential cyber threats.\n\nAs the global economy enters another year of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and China continues to seek to disrupt critical industries like the health care sector, the private industry must be reminded to be diligent about their networks and to know their response plans, have a paper copy available and review their cyber-related insurance policies.\n\nThe USAO has established contact lines for assistance 24 hours a day.

            "article_text": "Two Iranian nationals have been charged in connection with a coordinated cyber intrusion campaign \u2013 sometimes at the behest of the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran (Iran) \u2013 targeting computers in New Jersey, elsewhere in the United States, Europe and the Middle East, the Department of Justice announced today.\n\nAccording to a 10-count indictment returned on Sept. 15, 2020, Hooman Heidarian, a/k/a \u201cneo,\u201d 30, and Mehdi Farhadi, a/k/a \u201cMehdi Mahdavi\u201d and \u201cMohammad Mehdi Farhadi Ramin,\u201d 34, both of Hamedan, Iran, stole hundreds of terabytes of data, which typically included confidential communications pertaining to national security, foreign policy intelligence, non-military nuclear information, aerospace data, human rights activist information, victim financial information and personally identifiable information, and intellectual property, including unpublished scientific research.\u00a0 In some instances, the defendants\u2019 hacks were politically motivated or at the behest of Iran, including instances where they obtained information regarding dissidents, human rights activists, and opposition leaders.\u00a0 In other instances, the defendants sold the hacked data and information on the black market for private financial gain.\n\n\u201cWe will not bring the rule of law to cyberspace until governments refuse to provide safe harbor for criminal hacking within their borders,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers.\u00a0 \u201cUnfortunately, our cases demonstrate that at least four nations \u2014 Iran, China, Russia and North Korea \u2014 will allow criminal hackers to victimize individuals and companies from around the world, as long as these hackers will also work for that country\u2019s government \u2014 gathering information on human rights activists, dissidents and others of intelligence interest.\u00a0 Today\u2019s defendants will now learn that such service to the Iranian regime is not an asset, but a criminal yoke that they will now carry until the day they are brought to justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese Iranian nationals allegedly conducted a wide-ranging campaign on computers here in New Jersey and around the world,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Carpenito for the District of New Jersey. \u201cThey brazenly infiltrated computer systems and targeted intellectual property and often sought to intimidate perceived enemies of Iran, including dissidents fighting for human rights in Iran and around the world. This conduct threatens our national security, and as a result, these defendants are wanted by the FBI and are considered fugitives from justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe indictment of two Iranian nationals charged with computer hacking, fraud, and aggravated identity theft demonstrates how the FBI continues to work relentlessly with our law enforcement partners to identify cybercriminals\u00a0who seek to do harm to American citizens, businesses, and universities,\u00a0regardless of where those criminals may reside and hold them accountable,\u201d said George M. Crouch Jr., Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Newark Division. \u201cMehdi Farhadi and Hooman Heidarian are now fugitives and have been added to the FBI website for charges in connection with a massive, coordinated cyber intrusion campaign. These actions demonstrate how imposing risks and consequences on our cyber adversaries will continue to be a top priority for the FBI.\u201d\n\nAccording to the indictment:\n\nBeginning in at least 2013, the defendants were responsible for a coordinated campaign of cyber intrusions into computer systems in New Jersey and around the world. The victims included several American and foreign universities, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, a defense contractor, an aerospace company, a foreign policy organization, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), non-profits, and foreign government and other entities the defendants identified as rivals or adversaries to Iran.\u00a0 In addition to the theft of highly protected and sensitive data, the defendants also vandalized websites, often under the pseudonym \u201cSejeal\u201d and posted messages that appeared to signal the demise of Iran\u2019s internal opposition, foreign adversaries, and countries identified as rivals to Iran, including Israel and Saudi Arabia.\n\nTo select their victims, the defendants conducted online reconnaissance, including gathering public data and intelligence to determine a victim\u2019s areas of expertise, and using vulnerability scanning tools and other means to assess computer networks. \u00a0The defendants gained and maintained unauthorized access to victim networks using various tools, including: session hijacking, where a valid computer session was exploited to gain unauthorized access to information or services in a computer system; SQL injection, in which they used malicious code to access information that was not intended to be displayed, such as sensitive government data, user details, and personal identifiers; and malicious programs installations, which allowed the defendants to maintain unauthorized access to computers.\n\nThe defendants then used key-loggers and \u201cremote access Trojans\u201d to maintain access and monitor the actions of users of the victim networks. They also developed a botnet tool, which facilitated the spread of malware, denial of service attacks, and spamming to victim networks. In some instances, the defendants used their unauthorized access to victim networks or accounts to establish automated forwarding rules for compromised victim accounts, whereby new outgoing and incoming emails were automatically forwarded from the compromised accounts to accounts controlled by defendants.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Demers and U.S. Attorney Carpenito credited special agents of the FBI, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Crouch in Newark, with the investigation leading to the charges.\n\nEach defendant is charged with: one count of conspiracy to commit fraud and related activity in connection with computers and access devices; unauthorized access to protected computers; unauthorized damage to protected computers; conspiracy to commit wire fraud; and access device fraud; and five counts of aggravated identity theft.\n\nThe counts of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and related activity in connection with computers and access devices, and unauthorized access to protected computers, each carry a maximum sentence of five years in prison. The counts of unauthorized damage to protected computers and access device fraud each carry a maximum sentence of ten years in prison.\u00a0 The count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. The counts of aggravated identity theft each carry a mandatory sentence of two years in prison.\n\nThe government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney Dean C. Sovolos of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office National Security Unit, Daniel V. Shapiro, Deputy Chief of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office Criminal Division, and Trial Attorney Scott McCulloch of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.\n\nThe charges and allegations contained in the indictment are merely accusations and the defendants are considered innocent unless and until proven guilty.",

            "article_text": "STANISLAV ROMANYUK, 39, a citizen of Ukraine last residing in Estonia, pleaded guilty yesterday in New Haven federal court to a money laundering charge stemming from his role in a scheme to violate United States export laws and regulations by attempting to smuggle a dual-use export-controlled item to Russia.\n\nU.S. Attorney Vanessa Roberts Avery; Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division; Michael Khoo Directors of Task Force KleptoCapture; Special Agent in Charge Michael J. Krol of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), New England; Acting Special Agent in Charge Aaron Tambrini of the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Office of Export Enforcement, Boston Field Office; Special Agent in Charge Robert Fuller of the FBI New Haven Division; and Special Agent in Charge Harry T. Chavis, Jr. of IRS Criminal Investigation in New England, made the announcement.\n\nAccording to court documents and statements made in court, beginning in 2018, Romanyuk, who operated Estonia-based BY Trade O\u00dc, conspired with Vadims Ananics and Eriks Mamonovs, both citizens of Latvia who operated CNC Weld, a Latvia-based corporation, and with individuals in Russia and a Russian company, to violate U.S. export laws and regulations to smuggle a 500 Series CPWZ Precision Jig Grinder that was manufactured in Connecticut to Russia.\n\nA jig grinder is a high-precision grinding machine system that does not require a license to export to European Union countries, but does require a license for export and reexport to Russia because of its potential application in nuclear proliferation and defense programs.\u00a0 Romanyuk and his co-conspirators knew that the jig grinder could not be exported from the U.S. to Russia or any country outside the European Union, and they did not apply for, receive, or possess a license of authorization from the U.S. Department of Commerce to export or reexport the jig grinder to Russia, as required by the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 and the Export Administration Regulations (\u201cEAR\u201d), which restrict the export of items that could make a significant contribution to the military potential of other nations or that could be detrimental to U.S. foreign policy and national security.\n\nIn April 2019, Romanyuk brokered the sale of the jig grinder from By Trade O\u00dc to a Russian company using funds wired to it from the Russian company to purchase the jig grinder from Sapphire Universal, LLP, a company in Latvia.\u00a0 Sapphire Universal, which Romanyuk knew was in the business of obtaining dual use items from the U.S. for sale in Russia, used CNC Weld as the claimed recipient and end-user of the jig grinder because no license was required to export the jig grinder to Latvia from the U.S.\u00a0 In August 2019, to finalize the purchase of the jig grinder, Ananics and others traveled to Bridgeport, Connecticut, where Ananics informed the sellers that the jig grinder was being purchased for the benefit of CNC Weld.\u00a0 In September 2021, Romanyuk provided a false statement to Estonian authorities about the jig grinder transaction in order to cover up his involvement in this scheme.\n\nU.S. authorities, working with Latvian authorities, intercepted the jig grinder in Riga, Latvia, before it was to be shipped to Russia.\u00a0 Approximately $826,000 in funds involved in the purchase of the jig grinder were subsequentlyforfeited, and a substantial portion of the forfeited funds weretransferred to Estoniato provide aid to Ukraine.\n\nRomanyuk was arrested on June 13, 2022, in Latvia.\u00a0 He has been detained since his arrest.\n\nRomanyuk pleaded guilty to international money laundering conspiracy, an offense that carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years.\u00a0 A sentencing date is not scheduled.\n\nAnanics and Mamonovs pleaded guilty to related charges and await sentencing.\n\nThis investigation is being conducted by HSI field offices in New Haven and the Hague, Netherlands; the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Office of Export Enforcement in Boston and Portland, Oregon; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and the Internal Revenue Service \u2013 Criminal Investigation Division.\u00a0 The Prosecutor-General\u2019s Office of the Republic of Latvia, the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office of the Republic of Estonia, Latvian Tax and Customs Police, Estonian Tax and Customs Board, and the Latvian State Police have assisted the investigation.\n\nThis case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Rahul Kale, Konstantin Lantsman, and Stephanie Levick of the District of Connecticut, and Trial Attorney Brendan Geary of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division, Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.\u00a0 The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs has provided valuable assistance.\n\nThe investigation was coordinated through the Justice Department\u2019s Task Force KleptoCapture, an interagency law enforcement task force dedicated to enforcing the sweeping sanctions, export controls, and economic countermeasures that the United States, along with its foreign allies and partners, has imposed in response to Russia\u2019s unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine. Announced by the Attorney General on March 2, 2022, and under the leadership of the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the task force will continue to leverage all of the department\u2019s tools and authorities to combat efforts to evade or undermine the collective actions taken by the U.S. government in response to Russian military aggression.\n\nThis case is being prosecuted through the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF) Program and is being supported by OCDETF\u2019s International Organized Crime Intelligence and Operations Center (IOC-2).\u00a0 OCDETF identifies, disrupts and dismantles drug traffickers, money launderers, gangs and transnational criminal organizations through a prosecutor-led and intelligence-driven approach that leverages the strengths of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies.\u00a0 Additional information about the OCDETF Program can be found athttps://www.justice.gov/OCDETF.",

Crouch Jr., Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Newark Division, said. \u201cMehdi Farhadi and Hooman Heidarian are now fugitives and have been added to the FBI website for charges in connection with a massive, coordinated cyber intrusion campaign. These actions demonstrate how imposing risks and consequences on our cyber adversaries will continue to be a top priority for the FBI.\u201d\n\nAccording to the indictment:\n\nBeginning in at least 2013, the defendants were responsible for a coordinated campaign of cyber intrusions into computer systems in New Jersey and around the world. The victims included several American and foreign universities, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, a defense contractor, an aerospace company, a foreign policy organization, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), non-profits, and foreign government and other entities identified as rivals or adversaries to Iran around the world.\n\nHeidarian and Farhadi conducted many of these intrusions on behalf of the Iranian government. The stolen data was typically highly protected and extremely sensitive, and included confidential communications pertaining to national security, foreign policy intelligence, non-military nuclear information, aerospace data, human rights activist information, victim financial information and personally identifiable information, and intellectual property, including unpublished scientific research. The defendants also often vandalized websites using the pseudonym \u201cSejeal\u201d and posted messages that appeared to signal the demise of Iran\u2019s internal opposition, foreign adversaries, and countries identified as rivals to Iran, including Israel and Saudi Arabia.\n\nTactics and Techniques\n\nThe defendants conducted online reconnaissance to carefully select their victims, gathering data and intelligence to determine their areas of expertise, and assessing computer networks in preparation for launching cyber-attacks. They often used information obtained at this stage in latter phases of their hacking activities to complete a picture of processes, organizational structure, and potential soft spots of victim networks. The defendants used vulnerability-scanning tools to test the victim networks and to reveal security holes.\n\nThe defendants gained and maintained unauthorized access to victim networks using various tools, including: session hijacking, where a valid computer session was exploited to gain unauthorized access to information or services in a computer system; SQL injection, in which they used malicious code to access information that was not intended to be displayed, such as sensitive government data, user details, and personal identifiers; and malicious programs installations, which allowed the defendants to maintain unauthorized access to computers.\n\nThe defendants then used key-loggers and \u201cremote access Trojans\u201d to maintain access and monitor the actions of users of the victim networks. They also developed a botnet tool, which facilitated the spread of malware, denial of service attacks, and spamming to victim networks. In some instances, the defendants used their unauthorized access to victim networks or accounts to establish automated forwarding rules for compromised victim accounts, whereby new outgoing and incoming emails were automatically forwarded from the compromised accounts to accounts controlled by defendants\n\nUsing these methods, the defendants stole hundreds of terabytes of data, including confidential victim work product and intellectual property, and personal identifying information, such as access credentials, names, addresses, phone numbers, Social Security numbers, and birthdates. The defendants marketed stolen data on the black market.\n\nIn addition to stealing intellectual property and other data, the defendants, using the pseudonym \u201cSejeal,\u201d replaced the publicly available contents of websites with political and other ideological content, thereby defacing websites, for the apparent purpose of projecting Iranian influence and threatening perceived enemies of Iran. The defacements featured, among other things, images of burning Israeli flags and threats forecasting the death or demise of citizens in the United States, Israel, and elsewhere.\n\nU.S. Attorney Carpenito credited special agents of the FBI, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Crouch in Newark, with the investigation leading to the charges.\n\nThe counts of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and related activity in connection with computers and access devices, unauthorized access to protected computers, and computer fraud \u2013 unauthorized damage to protected computers, each carry a maximum sentence of five years in prison. The count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. The counts of aggravated identity theft each carry a mandatory sentence of two years in prison. The count of access device fraud carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.\n\nThe government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney Dean C. Sovolos of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office National Security Unit, Daniel V. Shapiro, Deputy Chief of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office Criminal Division, and Trial Attorney Scott McCulloch of the National Security Division.\n\nThe charges and allegations contained in the indictment are merely accusations and the defendants are considered innocent unless and until proven guilty.",

            "article_text": "A federal judge in Amarillo yesterday sentenced Dr. Richard Kazmaier, 55, to six months in prison, three years of post-release supervision, and a $5,000 fine. Kazmaier pleaded guilty on Aug. 19, 2022, to a Lacey Act felony for importing protected wildlife into the United States without declaring it or obtaining the required permits.\n\nAccording to court documents, Kazmaier was an associate professor of biology at West Texas A&M University before resigning in October 2022. A federal grand jury issued an indictment in January 2022 charging Kazmaier with smuggling goods into the United States and two violations of the Endangered Species Act. Kazmaier pleaded guilty to a superseding information charging the Lacey Act, the nation\u2019s oldest wildlife trafficking statute. The court dismissed the indictment at the government\u2019s request.\n\nThe Lacey Act and federal regulations require importers to declare wildlife to customs and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service when it enters the country. Between March 2013 and February 2020, Kazmaier admitted he imported wildlife items from Bulgaria, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Indonesia, Latvia, Norway, Russia, South Africa, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Uruguay into Texas without declaring them. Kazmaier admitted he purchased and imported approximately 358 wildlife items with a total market value of $14,423 from eBay and other online sales websites. He did not import any live animals and instead purchased mostly skulls, skeletons, and taxidermy mounts.\n\nThe Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) regulates trade in endangered or threatened species through permit requirements. The United States and 183 other countries are signatories to the CITES treaty. Kazmaier acknowledged importing 14 protected species without obtaining permits, including the Eurasian otter, lynx, caracal, vervet monkey, greater naked-tailed armadillo, and king bird-of-paradise.\n\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s Office of Law Enforcement in Redmond, Washington, conducted the investigation as part of Operation Global Reach. The operation focused on the trafficking of wildlife from Indonesia to the United States.\n\nThe government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney Anna Marie Bell for the Northern District of Texas and Senior Trial Attorney Ryan Connors of the Department of Justice\u2019s Environmental Crimes Section.",

Lofthus, the Assistant Attorney General for Administration.\n\nLofthus exemplifies the very best in executive leadership and has demonstrated three decades of dedication to public service which have resulted in outstanding organizational achievements.\u00a0 As the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s Senior Management Official, he provides effective leadership, directing diverse and complicated financial and budgetary programs, human resources, procurement, facilities, security and information technology activities.\u00a0 His career in public service has been distinguished by an unfaltering dedication to lead, motivate and inspire people.\u00a0 His vision, adaptability and commitment to customer service enable him to direct organizations through many complex endeavors and times of uncertainty.\u00a0 He has transformed the department\u2019s administrative processes through innovative technologies and the recruitment and retention of talented and diverse leadership.\u00a0 On the financial side, since 2004, Lofthus accomplished a rare feat in that he was able to get clean audits for the department for 12 straight years and for nine straight years, the auditor\u2019s report on internal control identified no material weaknesses at the consolidated level.\u00a0 Lofthus has played a central role in developing budget strategies in direct response to the initiatives of several Attorneys General in the areas of counterterrorism, national security and the administration of justice.\u00a0 He has provided unmatched leadership in initiatives to provide funding to state and local law enforcement entities throughout the department.\u00a0 Lofthus is well-known and respected in a variety of public and private arenas, and he is commonly sought out to advise and speak on a variety of challenging government-wide financial and budgetary-based initiatives.\n\nTheAttorney General\u2019s Award for Distinguished Serviceis the Justice Department\u2019s second-highest award for employee performance.\u00a0 The recipients of this award exemplify the highest commitment to the department\u2019s mission.\u00a0 Seventeen Distinguished Service Awards are presented this year to individuals or teams of people.\n\nThe first Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\u2019 (ATF\u2019s) Violent Crime Intelligence Division, Special AgentsTolliver L.

Kullyand Trial AttorneysWilliam H. Jones II,John R. Read,Adam C. SpeegleandNathan P. Sutton; from the Antitrust Division\u2019s Appellate Section, Section ChiefKristen C.

Fleming; and from the Criminal Division\u2019s Appellate Section, Trial AttorneyFinnuala K. Tessier.\n\nThe Antitrust Division\u2019s victory against Apple Inc. for orchestrating a conspiracy to raise the prices of e-books represents one of the most significant civil litigation victories that the division has achieved in over a decade, and it has led to state attorneys general and private plaintiffs recovering on behalf of harmed consumers approximately $566 million in damages.\u00a0 The recipients represented the United States in trial against Apple in June 2013 and successfully defended the case against Apple\u2019s appeal.\u00a0 In April 2010, when Apple launched its iBookstore and entered the e-books market, U.S. e-book prices rose uniformly, in some instances as much as 50 percent.\u00a0 The division launched an investigation into possible coordination among e-book publishers and Apple and, in April 2012, brought suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging a conspiracy to raise e-book prices in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.\u00a0 Over the course of the litigation, all the publishers settled with the federal government.\u00a0 However, Apple aggressively litigated the matter through a three-week trial in June 2013 before U.S. District Judge Denise Cote, who issued a 160-page order finding Apple liable for orchestrating a scheme among five of the six largest book publishers to raise e-book prices in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.\u00a0 Apple\u2019s vigorous efforts to pursue the matter on appeal ended in March 2016 when the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) rejected Apple\u2019s petition for certiorari to review the Second Circuit\u2019s decision affirming Judge Cote\u2019s order.\u00a0 The litigation of this action and the precedent created by the trial court\u2019s and Second Circuit\u2019s decisions should deter those who in the future might contemplate violating U.S. antitrust laws.\n\nThe third Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the Antitrust Division\u2019s New York Office, Section ChiefJeffrey D. Martinoand Trial AttorneysBryan C. Bughman,Joseph Muoio Jr.andCarrie A. Syme; from the Antitrust Division\u2019s Chicago Office, Trial AttorneyEric L.

Winters; and from the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office, Special AgentsJennifer RikerandJeffrey Weeksand Forensic AccountantKyle D. Dornbos.\n\nThe recipients, through their leadership, dedication and tireless investigation of price fixing and bid rigging, are responsible for the historic prosecution of five of the world\u2019s largest financial institutions that agreed to pay fines in excess of $2.7 billion.\u00a0 The investigation uncovered a conspiracy that affected the U.S. Dollar to Euro exchange rate.\u00a0 These currencies are at the heart of international commerce, and the conspiracy undermined the integrity and the competitiveness of foreign currency exchange markets which account for hundreds of billions of dollars of transactions every day.\u00a0 The companies responsible for actions that eliminated competition in the marketplace were held accountable for their illegal conduct, which will hopefully deter financial institutions from chasing profits without regard to fairness, the law or the public welfare.\n\nThe fourth Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the Office of the Solicitor General, Assistant to the Solicitor GeneralEric J. Feigin; from the Civil Rights Division\u2019s Appellate Section, ChiefDiana K. Flynn, Principal Deputy ChiefSharon M. McGowanand Trial AttorneyRobert A. Koch; and from the Civil Division\u2019s Appellate Staff, DirectorDouglas N. Letterand AttorneysJeffrey E. SandbergandAbby C. Wright.\n\nIn Obergefell v. Hodges, SCOTUS struck down state bans on marriage equality that denied to same-sex couples and their children the protections and benefits of marriage.\u00a0 In doing so, SCOTUS granted LGBT individuals equal access to marriage and vindicated the Obama Administration\u2019s strong interest in the eradication of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.\u00a0 This team is honored for its extraordinary work in this historic case.\u00a0 Under immense time pressures, the recipients worked collaboratively to craft a compelling, persuasive and successful legal brief on a seminal civil rights issue.\u00a0 The brief reiterated the department\u2019s US v. Windsor position that classifications based on sexual orientation should trigger heightened scrutiny and described the harm that the state bans inflicted on same-sex couples and their families.\u00a0 In June 2015, SCOTUS issued a powerful decision extending the right to marry to same-sex couples and joining the ranks of landmark civil rights pronouncements from the court.\n\nThe fifth Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the Criminal Division\u2019s Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section, Deputy ChiefMatthew R. Stiglitz, Special CounselStacey Luckand Paralegal SpecialistLinda Faulk; from the Criminal Division\u2019s Office of International Affairs, Associate DirectorMagdalena Boynton; from the Criminal Division\u2019s Narcotic and Dangerous Drug Division, Judicial Attach\u00e9Marlon Cobar; from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office of the Eastern District of Virginia, Assistant U.S. AttorneyMichael P.

Quintero; from the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office, Special AgentBeau Bourgeois; and from the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Special AgentSuhaib Karim Qureshi.\n\nOn June 20, 2013, DEA Special Agent James Terry Watson was stabbed to death during an attempted kidnapping and robbery perpetrated by an organized group of taxi drivers in Bogota.\u00a0 A team of investigators and prosecutors was assembled, and working with their Colombian counterparts, they quickly identified seven individuals responsible for the murder and subsequent destruction of evidence.\u00a0 In an example of teamwork and coordination at its best, a complaint was filed and arrest warrants were obtained for the suspects within four days of the crime; within 18 months, the defendants\u2019 extraditions were secured and they were all convicted.\u00a0 Because of the diligent work of those assigned to the case, justice was served for the family of Special Agent Watson.\n\nThe sixth Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the Criminal Division\u2019s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section, ChiefSteven J. Grockiand Deputy ChiefKeith A. Becker; from the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, Trial AttorneySarah Chang; from the Criminal Division\u2019s Office of International Affairs, Senior Trial AttorneyJudith Friedman; from the Criminal Division\u2019s Appellate Section, AttorneyDavid M.

StanleyandJeffrey D. Tarpinian.\n\nThe recipients are recognized for their involvement in Operation Torpedo, a precedent-setting investigation that used first-of-its-kind techniques to infiltrate the dark internet and identify individuals who, under the perceived cloak of anonymity, secretly congregated to trade images of children being sexually abused and to celebrate the sexual abuse of children.\u00a0 By developing and deploying a network investigative technique, with appropriate legal authority, investigators were able to identify members of three websites devoted to child pornography that were operating on an anonymous network.\u00a0 The investigation required round-the-clock efforts from agents, analysts and prosecutors, and rapid response to fast-breaking developments.\u00a0 Prosecutors successfully defended these novel investigations in court and have obtained convictions at every turn.\u00a0 The impact of this investigation cannot be overstated.\u00a0 It has pioneered investigative work into the dark web that has led to subsequent significant investigations by the Criminal Division and the FBI; the dismantling of more than 100 child exploitation websites; and the seizure of massive amounts of child exploitation material, the largest seizure of virtual currency to date and the discovery of 120 victims of child sexual exploitation.\n\nThe seventh Distinguished Service Award is presented to Deputy ChiefFranz R. Marshallof the Civil Rights Division\u2019s Educational Opportunities Section.\u00a0 Marshall is recognized for his remarkable 43 years of service to the department, virtually all of which has been spent in the Civil Rights Division, where he has dedicated each day to breaking down barriers to educational opportunities for students across the country.\u00a0 Over the course of his career, he has represented the United States in hundreds of desegregation cases and through this work, Marshall has fiercely protected and embodied a core and founding mission of the Civil Rights Division, dismantling obstacles to opportunity and success in America\u2019s public schools.\u00a0 Furthermore, Marshall has shaped the legal landscape and cleared paths to a better life for countless students.\u00a0 He has given voice to children and parents in communities throughout the United States, from Native Americans in the Four Corners to African Americans in the Louisiana Bayou.\u00a0 In short, no department lawyer has done more to open the schoolhouse doors to all children and to fulfill the principles and promise of Brown v. Board of Education.\n\nThe eighth Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the Environment and Natural Resources Division\u2019s Environmental Enforcement Section, Section ChiefThomas A.

Lauderdale, Florida, law firm of Rothstein Rosenfeldt & Adler P.A. (RRA).\u00a0 The basis of the scheme was the sale of securities in which investors purchased the rights to a stream of payments from corporate entities which ostensibly had reached confidential settlements with purported plaintiffs in sexual harassment, employment discrimination and whistleblower cases.\u00a0 Settlements were available for purchase in amounts ranging from hundreds of thousands to tens of millions of dollars.\u00a0 During the operation of the scheme, hundreds of investors remitted more than $1.2 billion to RRA, which funds were utilized to pay previous investors in the scheme to finance a lavish lifestyle for the participants, and to make political and charitable contributions which enhanced the prestige and visibility of RRA, thereby enhancing RRA\u2019s ability to attract new investors.\u00a0 During the ensuing six years of litigation, 29 defendants, including attorneys and public officials, were convicted and sentenced on charges including racketeering, wire fraud, money laundering, income tax fraud, campaign finance violations, obstruction of justice, extortion and civil rights violations.\u00a0 Additionally, through forfeiture proceedings instituted by the government, coupled with proceedings in bankruptcy court and other ancillary civil proceedings, more than $400 million in assets were ultimately recovered, resulting in full restitution to the defrauded investors.\n\nThe 10thDistinguished Service Award is presented to, from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office of the Southern District of New York, Assistant U.S. AttorneysJohn P.

Sullivan of the District of Columbia.\u00a0 During a five-week, highly publicized trial, the trial team made its case largely through the documents and adverse testimony of GE and Electrolux, uncooperative competitors and economic analysis, demonstrating that the merger would have a significant effect on the prices of ranges, cooktops and wall ovens.\u00a0 One day before trial was to conclude, GE abandoned the proposed merger and as a result, U.S. consumers will be able to save hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nThe secondJohn Marshall Award for Trial of Litigationis presented to the team responsible for the prosecution and conviction of Jeffrey Sterling.\u00a0 As a result of their tireless efforts over the course of several years, Sterling was found guilty of unauthorized disclosures of classified information vital to national security in the first Espionage Act trial of its kind in decades.\u00a0 The successful outcome was the result of over four years of complex pre-trial litigation involving classified information, covert witnesses, First Amendment issues and media subpoenas.\u00a0 At trial, the prosecutors proved that Sterling, a former CIA officer, disclosed to a journalist the details of an extremely sensitive, valuable and classified clandestine operation designed to undermine the Iranian nuclear weapons program.\u00a0 Sterling\u2019s crime not only undermined a valuable tool to attack Iran\u2019s nuclear program, but also endangered the lives of an important human asset and his family.\u00a0 The defendant\u2019s unlawful disclosures put lives at risk and constituted an egregious breach of the public trust.\u00a0 Sterling was sentenced to 42 months in prison.\u00a0 This case demonstrates the perseverance, tenacity and commitment of the prosecution team in overcoming formidable challenges in bringing this uniquely complex case to trial in the interests of justice and national security.\u00a0 Award recipients include, from the Criminal Division\u2019s Public Integrity Section, Deputy ChiefEric G.

Goldman.\u00a0 Goldman has proven himself to be an extraordinary and productive appellate advocate, who masterfully handles complex, large-record appeals.\u00a0 Although his cases have run the gamut from street crime to securities fraud, Goldman has brought his sophisticated analysis to two areas that bedevil the courts and prosecutors; insider trading, where he drafted a SCOTUS merits brief and a certiorari petition, and extraterritoriality, where, in one case, he defended the murder conviction of a Colombian national who murdered a DEA agent in Bogota and, in a second case, assisted the Solicitor General in formulating arguments on the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act\u2019s extraterritorial reach.\u00a0 He not only volunteers to take on extra work within the division, but he also seized the opportunity to review commutation applications filed by convicted drug traffickers because he believes so strongly in the Obama Administration\u2019s initiative to provide relief to nonviolent offenders who have already served significant prison terms.\u00a0 Finally, Goldman serves on the division\u2019s Diversity Committee and mentors a minority law student.\u00a0 He understands the department\u2019s mission writ large and he gives his best at all times.\n\nThe second Outstanding Contributions by a New Employee Award is presented to Special AgentAdebowale Babarinde Aladeof the FBI\u2019s San Antonio Field Office.\u00a0 Alade was the lead investigator on a 32-month complex criminal investigation targeting the Almighty Latin King Nation (ALKN), a violent transnational criminal enterprise operating in Texas with connections across the United States and overseas.\u00a0 With less than one year in the FBI, and still serving as a probationary agent, Alade demonstrated exceptional initiative by carefully exploiting human source information in early 2013, resulting in the identification of a key leader of the ALKN with control over operations in Texas.\u00a0 He determined that the ALKN was importing and distributing large quantities of narcotics from Mexico-based cartels, and was also involved in weapons trafficking with access to military-grade weapons and grenades.\u00a0 After obtaining Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces designation, Alade relentlessly pursued ALKN\u2019s illicit activities, ultimately targeting its command and control structure through the use of sophisticated techniques involving the interception of communications through Title III court orders.\u00a0 During 2014, Alade exploited intelligence derived from ALKN communications and human sources, and developed a cohesive interagency team by sharing information with law enforcement partners, resulting in a collaborative effort to target the ALKN.\u00a0 In October 2015, his work resulted in the indictment of 48 members of the ALKN, including its entire leadership structure in Texas, on RICO Act and drug conspiracy charges, as well as state drug violations.\u00a0 Alade subsequently led the multiagency enforcement operation that disrupted the ALKN, resulting in the seizure of narcotics and firearms, thousands of rounds of ammunition, cash, body armor, extensive digital devices and a wide array of ALKN paraphernalia.\u00a0 In conducting this investigation, Alade directly supported the department\u2019s mission by ensuring public safety against domestic and foreign threats, as well as providing leadership in preventing and controlling crime.",

            "article_text": "The Justice Department today announced criminal charges in five cases from four U.S. Attorney\u2019s offices in connection with the multi-agency Disruptive Technology Strike Force (Strike Force).\n\nThe Strike Force is co-led by the Departments of Justice and Commerce to counter efforts by hostile nation states to illicitly acquire sensitive U.S. technology to advance their authoritarian regimes and facilitate human rights abuses. Launched in February 2023, the Strike Force\u2019s work has led to the unsealing of charges against 34 defendants in 24 cases involving alleged export control violations, smuggling, theft of trade secrets, and other charges by actors connected to Russia, China, and Iran.\n\nThe cases announced today took place over the course of multiple weeks, culminating in the arrest today of a Russian national allegedly seeking to illegally export electronics for use in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to Russia. The other cases also cover spearfishing of U.S-based scientists by an employee of a state-owned Chinese defense company and the smuggling of laser welding machines used in nuclear munition production to Russia.\n\n\u201cThe prosecutions of these cases under the Disruptive Technology Strike Force reflects the joint efforts of five agencies across the government focused on the shared goal of stopping the transfer of sensitive, cutting-edge technologies to Iran, China, and Russia,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department's National Security Division. \u201cThe Justice Department, through the work of the Strike Force, will continue to do all we can to prevent advanced technologies from falling into the hands of our adversaries and protect our national security.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe launched the Disruptive Technology Strike Force a year and half ago to advance the vital mission of safeguarding U.S. technology,\u201d said Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement Matthew S. Axelrod of the U.S. Department of Commerce. \u201cAs today\u2019s announcements make clear, our efforts to protect sensitive U.S. technologies \u2013 which to date have yielded 24 publicly charged criminal cases, millions of dollars in administrative penalties, and multiple Entity List additions \u2013 remain relentless and unyielding.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that the threats we face today are more complex and severe than ever before,\u201d\u00a0said Executive Assistant Director Robert Wells of the FBI\u2019s National Security Branch.\u00a0\u201cThe best way \u2013 and the only way \u2013 we can stay ahead of current and emerging threats is by working together. With these indictments, the Disruptive Technology Strike Force is an excellent example of the power of partnerships in practice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose who facilitate the illegal proliferation of sensitive technologies and material to hostile nations and terrorist groups pose a serious threat to the safety and security of the United States,\u201d said Executive Associate Director Katrina W. Berger of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). \u201cHSI is committed to working with our partners to disrupt and dismantle the criminal networks that aid and abed U.S. adversaries.\u201d\n\n\u201cDisrupting the efforts of foreign nations, international criminal organizations, and other potentially hostile entities that seek to illegally obtain sensitive DoD technology and weapon systems that could potentially be used against our military forces remains a top priority of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the criminal investigative arm of Department of Defense (DoD) Office of Inspector General,\u201d said Inspector General Robert P. Storch of DoD. \u201cWe will continue to work with the Justice Department and our strike force partners to thwart the efforts of criminal elements whose activities threaten the security of the United States.\u201d\n\nUnited States v. Postovoy (District of Columbia)\n\nA federal grand jury returned a seven-countindictmentcharging Denis Postovoy, a Russian citizen living in the United States, with conspiring to violate the Export Control Reform Act, commit smuggling, commit money laundering and defraud the United States. HSI arrested Postovoy this morning in Sarasota, Florida.\n\nAccording to court documents, beginning in at least February 2022, following Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Postovoy procured and illicitly exported from the United States to Russia microelectronic components with military applications. The exported microelectronics can be used in UAVs or drones. Through a web of companies that he owns or operates in Russia, Hong Kong, and elsewhere, Postovoy and individuals in his network purchased the microelectronics from U.S.-based distributors and exported them to Russia without the required licenses from the Department of Commerce.\n\nAs alleged, Postovoy\u2019s companies included WowCube HK Limited, JST Group Hong Kong, Jove HK Limited, all based in Hong Kong, and the Vector Group in Russia. Postovoy repeatedly concealed and misstated the true end users and end destinations of the microelectronics by submitting false information on export-related documents. He transshipped items that were ultimately destined for Russia through intermediary destinations, including Hong Kong, Switzerland and elsewhere, and received payments in U.S. dollars from foreign bank accounts. His companies transferred funds for the purchase and shipment of the goods through bank accounts in Hong Kong, Russia, and elsewhere to bank accounts in the United States, including bank accounts maintained by the U.S. suppliers of microelectronics and other sensitive technologies.\n\nHSI is investigating the case.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Stuart Allen for the District of Columbia and Trial Attorney Sean Heiden of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting the case.\n\nUnited States v. Song Wu (Northern District of Georgia)\n\nToday, a federal court in Atlanta, unsealed anindictmentcharging Chinese national, Song Wu, 39, with wire fraud and aggravated identity theft arising from his efforts to fraudulently obtain computer software and source code created by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), research universities, and private companies. Song remains at large.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Song allegedly engaged in a multi-year \u201cspear phishing\u201d email campaign in which he created email accounts to impersonate U.S.-based researchers and engineers and then used those imposter accounts to obtain specialized restricted or proprietary software used for aerospace engineering and computational fluid dynamics. This specialized software could be used for industrial and military applications, such as development of advanced tactical missiles and aerodynamic design and assessment of weapons.\n\nIn executing the scheme, Song allegedly sent spear phishing emails to individuals employed in positions with the U.S. government, including NASA, the Air Force, Navy, and Army, and the Federal Aviation Administration. Song also sent spear phishing emails to individuals employed in positions with major research universities in Georgia, Michigan, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Ohio, and with private sector companies that work in the aerospace field. Song\u2019s spear phishing emails appeared to the targeted victims as having been sent by a colleague, associate, friend, or other person in the research or engineering community. His emails requested that the targeted victim send or make available source code or software to which Song believed the targeted victim had access.\n\nAccording to the indictment, while conducting this spear phishing campaign, Song was employed as an engineer at Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), a Chinese state-owned aerospace and defense conglomerate headquartered in Beijing. AVIC manufactures civilian and military aircrafts and is one of the largest defense contractors in the world.\n\nIn total, Song is charged with 14 counts of wire fraud and 14 counts of aggravated identity theft. If convicted, Song faces a maximum statutory penalty of 20 years in prison for each count of wire fraud. Song also faces a mandatory, two-year consecutive penalty in prison for aggravated identity theft. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nThe FBI and the NASA\u2019s Office of Inspector General are investigating the case.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Samir Kaushal for the Northern District of Georgia and Trial Attorney Tanner Kroeger of the National Security Division's Cyber Section are prosecuting the case with assistance from the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.\n\nUnited States v. Teslenko (District of Massachusetts)\n\nMassachusetts resident, Samer Bhambhani, 55, and Russian national, Maksim Teslenko, 35, have beenchargedwith smuggling and one count of conspiracy to violate and evade export controls, commit smuggling, and defraud the United States. Bhambhani was arrested on Sept. 9 and was released on conditions following an initial appearance in federal court in Boston. Teslenko remains at large overseas.\n\nIt is alleged that from in or around 2015 through at least 2021, Bhambhani and Teslenko conspired to export laser welding machines from Bhambhani\u2019s employer in the United States to the Ural Electromechanical Plant (UEMZ) in Yekaterinburg, Russia, while falsifying the export documentation submitted to the U.S. government in order to conceal the fact that the UEMZ was the true end user of the machines. The UEMZ is a subsidiary of Rosatom, a Russian state corporation headquartered in Moscow, that oversaw Russia\u2019s civilian and military nuclear program. According to the indictment, Teslenko knew that the laser welding machines were intended for the portion of the UEMZ involving the Russian nuclear weapons program.\n\nThe charge of smuggling provides for a sentence of up to 10 years in prison, three years supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000. The charge of conspiracy provides for a sentence of up to five years in prison, three years supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorneys Timothy H. Kistner and Laura S. Kaplan for the District of Massachusetts and Trial Attorney Sean O\u2019Dowd of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting the case.\n\nUnited States v. Goodarzi (Southern District of Texas)\n\nGholam Reza Goodarzi, also known as Ron Goodarzi, 76, a dual U.S. and Iranian citizen who resides in Porter, Texas, was arrested at the George Bush International Airport on Aug. 30 based on a criminal complaint alleging he smuggled parts and components used in the production of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), as well as other manned aircraft, from the United States to Iran.\n\nAccording to court documents, from December 1, 2020, through July 5, Goodarzi illegally exported aircraft-related parts, in addition to oil and drilling components, to Iran. As alleged, Goodarzi purchased U.S.-origin aircraft components from U.S.-based suppliers and then exported them to Iran \u2013 typically through Dubai, UAE. He also traveled to and from Iran multiple times per year and concealed aircraft parts and other items in his checked luggage. Goodarzi exchanged multiple emails with suppliers and customers, acknowledging that parts could not be shipped to Iran because of sanctions.\n\nThe complaint alleges that on several occasions, authorities searched Goodarzi\u2019s luggage and found numerous aircraft parts and components hidden within articles of clothing. Some of the items had characteristics consistent with parts for the production of UAVs, as well as parts with electrical motor and generator applications. Goodarzi does not have the required licenses to export such items to sanctioned countries, including Iran, according to the complaint.\n\nThe FBI, with assistance from and Customs and Border Protection, is investigating the case.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Heather Winter for the Southern District of Texas and Trial Attorney Christopher Cook of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting the case.\n\nUnited States v. Nader (District of Columbia)\n\nU.S.-Iranian nationalJeffrey Chance Nader, 66, of Arcadia, California, was arrested on Aug. 13, 2024, based on an indictment charging him with crimes related to the procurement of U.S.-manufactured aircraft components, including components used on military aircraft, in violation of U.S. economic sanctions and other federal laws.\n\nAccording to the indictment, beginning at least in 2023, Nader and others conspired to purchase and export \u2013 and attempted to export \u2013 from the United States to Iran four types of aircraft components, totaling nearly three dozen individual pieces. Some of these components are for use on military aircraft operated by Iran\u2019s armed forces, including the F-4 fighter jet.\n\nNader, acting on purchase orders he received from customers in Iran, would coordinate the purchase of relevant aircraft components with business associates in Iran, by which they would reach out to U.S.-based suppliers of such components. In several instances, Nader identified himself and his company, California-based Pro Aero Capital, to these U.S.-based suppliers as the end-user of these items. Victim companies in this procurement scheme were located across the United States.\n\nOnce the aircraft components were obtained, Nader attempted to export the items on multiple separate occasions. The items were then transshipped to the ultimate customer in Iran. None of the transactions discussed in the indictment were successfully exported; they were detained on export by a Special Agent with the Department of Commerce.\n\nThis case is being investigated by the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office and the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security. Significant assistance was provided by the FBI\u2019s Los Angeles Field Office.\n\nThe case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Steven B. Wasserman for the District of Columbia and Trial Attorney Sean Heiden of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section. Significant assistance was provided by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California.\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\n\nToday\u2019s actions were coordinated through the Justice and Commerce Departments\u2019 Disruptive Technology Strike Force. The Disruptive Technology Strike Force is an interagency law enforcement strike force co-led by the Departments of Justice and Commerce designed to target illicit actors, protect supply chains and prevent critical technology from being acquired by authoritarian regimes and hostile nation states.\u00a0 ThePostovoyandTeslenkoinvestigations were also coordinated through the Justice Department\u2019s Task Force KleptoCapture, an interagency law enforcement task force dedicated to enforcing sanctions, export controls and economic countermeasures imposed in response to Russia\u2019s unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine.\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\n\nAlso today, the Department is announcing the unsealing of anindictmentin Chicago, Illinois, charging Chinese national Jia Wei with unlawfully accessing the computer network of a U.S. communications company to steal proprietary information for the benefit of the China-based entities.\n\nAs alleged, Wei was a member of the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA), the military of the People\u2019s Republic of China, and assigned to a PLA unit tasked with obtaining communications and information of third parties through computer hacking. In March 2017, Wei and his co-conspirators accessed the U.S. company\u2019s network without authorization approximately two days after the U.S. company filed a civil action against a China-based competitor for theft of communication-device trade secrets. Through this unauthorized access, Wei and his co-conspirators stole U.S. company documents relating to, among other things, the company\u2019s civilian and military communication devices, product development, testing plans, internal product evaluations and commercial information about competitors. These documents pertained to some of the same technology and information that the China-based competitor stole from the U.S. company, as alleged in the civil action. In addition, Wei and his co-conspirators stole documents from the U.S. company discussing the China-based competitor.\n\nDuring his unauthorized access, Wei and his co-conspirators attempted to install malicious software designed to provide persistent unauthorized access to the U.S. company\u2019s network. Wei\u2019s unauthorized access continued until approximately late May 2017.\n\nThe six-count indictment, returned in March 2022, charges Wei with wire fraud, conspiracy to commit computer intrusions, computer intrusions and aggravated identity theft. A warrant for his arrest has been issued. If convicted, Wei faces a maximum statutory penalty of 20 years in prison for each wire fraud count, five years in prison for each of the conspiracy and computer intrusion counts, and a mandatory, two-year consecutive penalty in prison for each aggravated identity theft count. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nThe FBI Chicago Field Office is investigating the case.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorneys Melody Wells, Steven Dollear and Thomas Peabody for the Northern District of Illinois and Trial Attorney Brett Reynolds of the National Security Division are prosecuting the case. Significant assistance was provided by the National Security Division\u2019s National Security Cyber Section.\n\nAn indictment, complaint or criminal information is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.\n\nNote:This press release was updated on Sept. 16, 2024, to include two additional cases.",

            "article_text": "DENVER \u2013 As part of the Department of Justice\u2019s ongoing efforts to prosecute sexual predators and protect innocent victims, Acting U.S. Attorney Bob Troyer and FBI Denver Division Special Agent in Charge Calvin Shivers are highlighting five recent child pornography cases that demonstrate both agencies\u2019 commitment to that mission. These cases follow shortly on the heels of Acting U.S. AttorneyBob Troyer's announcement of the formation of the Cybercrime and National Security Section, which is dedicated to protecting the citizens of Colorado and the nation from the growing threat of online crimes and threats to the homeland. The below cases demonstrate the effectiveness of this new section in responding to these threats.\n\n\n\nSharee Ewudzi-Acquah, age 47, of Westminster, Colorado, pleaded guilty on April 28, 2017 to possessing child pornography. She had been held without bond following her arrest by the FBI on the indictment obtained on October 20, 2016. According to the Plea Agreement and facts provided to the court during the defendant\u2019s detention hearing, the defendant traded child pornography with multiple other like-minded people using an application on her cellular telephones. The defendant shared dozens of images of child pornography online, and she engaged in graphic chats with others about having sex with children. She also chatted with a man about having a child they could molest together. Following the forensic analysis on Ewudzi-Acquah\u2019s phones, agents determined the defendant was using cloud storage, foreign emails, and foreign cloud storage \u2013 in both New Zealand and in Russia. Evidence also showed that the defendant, who had a long-term job at the University of Colorado, traded child pornography and chatted about child pornography while at work. The defendant is scheduled to be sentenced on July 28th, 2017 before U.S. District Court Judge Philip Brimmer. The defendant has agreed in the Plea Agreement not to seek a sentence of less than five years. She faces up to 10 years in federal prison, and up to a $250,000 fine to be followed by not less than 5 years up to lifetime supervised release. The defendant was remanded to custody pending the sentencing hearing.\n\n\n\nWalter Briggs, age 62, of Denver, Colorado, pleaded guilty on August 18, 2016, to a possession of child pornography charge. He was sentenced on April 24th, 2017 by Chief U.S. District Court Judge Marcia Krieger to serve 15 years in federal prison followed by supervised release for life. He was also ordered to pay $22,000 in restitution to his victims. Briggs was held without bond after his arrest by the FBI on the indictment on January 28th, 2016. He was remanded to custody following the sentencing hearing. According to court records, Briggs has two other felony sex convictions and was a registered sex offender at the time he committed the federal offense. In 1984, the defendant was convicted of Attempted Sexual Assault on a Child. In 1993, the defendant was convicted of Sexual Assault on a Child by One in a Position of Trust. Each involved the sex assault of minor girls. In October 2015, law enforcement found that Briggs was sharing online over 1,400 images and videos of child pornography, mostly of infant and toddler girls. The defendant was present at his home when FBI executed a search warrant. He was found in possession of at least 8,000 images of child pornography. The sheer size of his collection made a more exact accounting difficult since he had another 160,000 images across multiple devices. FBI found at least 1,000 images of infants or toddlers, and over 100 sadomasochistic sex abuse images of children.\n\n\n\nPaul Andrew Lee, age 54 of Parker, Colorado was arrested after being indicted by a federal grand jury on one count of accessing the Internet with intent to view child pornography. On April 28th, 2017, the defendant appeared in custody before the Honorable Magistrate Judge Mix. The court advised him that because he has at least one prior sex-related conviction, he was facing prison time of not less than 10 nor more than 20 years\u2019 imprisonment, not less than five years nor more than life supervised release, and a fine of up to $250,000. The defendant was ordered held without bond by U.S. Magistrate Judge Kristen L. Mix. The charges contained in the indictment are allegations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\n\n\n\nDamien Marc Smith, age 45 of Denver, Colorado, was arrested on April 26th, 2017 after being indicted of two counts of distribution and possession of child pornography charges. During the detention hearing on May 1, 2017, the government proffered evidence showing the defendant had been sharing and downloading child pornography for at least 10 years, and that he had been previously fired from a job for viewing child pornography at work, a fact not reported to law enforcement. Shortly before a search warrant was executed on defendant\u2019s residence, an undercover law enforcement officer downloaded approximately 700 images and 250 videos of child pornography from the defendant. One of the videos of child pornography that he was sharing was over two hours long. During the search warrant execution, the defendant was found in possession of at least 140,000 images and videos of child pornography. The defendant had sorted his collection of child pornography into folders on his devices with titles such as \u201cpre-teen hard core,\u201d and \u201c!keepers\u201d. The defendant was ultimately released on bond conditions. If convicted of distribution of child pornography, the defendant faces not less than 5 years, and up to 20 years in federal prison. If convicted of possession of child pornography, he faces up to 10 years' imprisonment. Both counts also carry potential fines of up to $250,000 per count as well as not less than 5 years\u2019 up to lifetime of supervised release. The charges contained in the indictment are allegations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\n\n\n\nThese cases were investigated by the FBI andthe FBI Child Exploitation Task Force. They are being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Valeria Spencer, assigned to the Cybercrime and National Security Section at the Colorado U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\n\n\nDavid Eugene Reed, age 66, of Longmont, Colorado was sentenced on April 26th, 2017 by U.S. District Court Judge William Martinez to serve 64 months in prison and pay $10,100 in fines and special assessments followed by 10 years of supervised release. Reed was also ordered to pay restitution of $14,500 to the victims of his crime. The sentence was handed down on April 26, 2017, and Reed was remanded into custody at the conclusion of the hearing. According to court records, the FBI executed a search warrant at the defendant\u2019s home in Longmont. Reed, a recent retiree, was present during the search and he told the FBI agents that he had accessed child pornography daily for approximately 15 years, that he attempted to cover up his conduct by running a cleaning tool on his computer every day, and that he searched for child pornography on the \u201cDark Web\u201d through \u201cTor\u201d anonymization software. A computer forensic analysis revealed that Reed had amassed 248,150 images and 1,341 videos that depicted the sexual abuse of children. The files were organized on the defendant\u2019s computer by folders bearing the child victims\u2019 names.\n\n\n\nThis case was investigated by the FBI. The defendant was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney David Tonini, assigned to the Cybercrime and National Security Section of the Colorado U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.",

            "article_text": "Assistant U. S. Attorney Jonathan I. Shapiro (619) 546-8225\n\nNEWS RELEASE SUMMARY\u2013 June 16, 2022\n\nSAN DIEGO \u2013 The U.S. Department of Justice, together with law enforcement partners in Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, have dismantled the infrastructure of a Russian botnet known as RSOCKS which hacked millions of computers and other electronic devices around the world.\n\nA botnet is a group of hacked internet-connected devices that are controlled as a group without the owner\u2019s knowledge and typically used for malicious purposes. Every device that is connected to the internet is assigned an Internet Protocol (IP) address.\n\nAccording to a search warrant affidavit, unsealed today in the Southern District of California, and the operators\u2019 own claims, the RSOCKS botnet, operated by Russian cybercriminals, comprised millions of hacked devices worldwide. The RSOCKS botnet initially targeted Internet of Things (IoT) devices. IoT devices include a broad range of devices\u2014including industrial control systems, time clocks, routers, audio/video streaming devices, and smart garage door openers, which are connected to, and can communicate over, the internet, and therefore, are assigned IP addresses. The RSOCKS botnet expanded into compromising additional types of devices, including Android devices and conventional computers.\n\n\u201cThe RSOCKS botnet compromised millions of devices throughout the world,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Randy Grossman. \u201cCyber criminals will not escape justice regardless of where they operate. Working with public and private partners around the globe, we will relentlessly pursue them while using all the tools at our disposal to disrupt their threats and prosecute those responsible.\u201d\u00a0 Grossman thanked the prosecution team, the FBI and the Department of Justice Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crimes and Intellectual Property Section for their excellent work on this case.\n\n\u201cThis operation disrupted a highly sophisticated Russia-based cybercrime organization that conducted cyber intrusions in the United States and abroad,\u201d said FBI Special Agent in Charge Stacey Moy. \u201cOur fight against cybercriminal platforms is a critical component in ensuring cybersecurity and safety in the United States. The actions we are announcing today are a testament to the FBI\u2019s ongoing commitment to pursuing foreign threat actors in collaboration with our international and private sector partners.\u201d\n\nA legitimate proxy service provides IP addresses to its clients for a fee. Typically, the proxy service provides access to IP addresses that it leases from internet service providers (ISPs). Rather than offer proxies that RSOCKS had leased, the RSOCKS botnet offered its clients access to IP addresses assigned to devices that had been hacked. The owners of these devices did not give the RSOCKS operator(s) authority to access their devices in order to use their IP addresses and route internet traffic. A cybercriminal who wanted to utilize the RSOCKS platform could use a web browser to navigate to a web-based \u201cstorefront\u201d (i.e., a public web site that allows users to purchase access to the botnet), which allowed the customer to pay to rent access to a pool of proxies for a specified daily, weekly, or monthly time period. The cost for access to a pool of RSOCKS proxies ranged from $30 per day for access to 2,000 proxies to $200 per day for access to 90,000 proxies.\n\nOnce purchased, the customer could download a list of IP addresses and ports associated with one or more of the botnet\u2019s backend servers. The customer could then route malicious internet traffic through the compromised victim devices to mask or hide the true source of the traffic. It is believed that the users of this type of proxy service were conducting large scale attacks against authentication services, also known as credential stuffing, and anonymizing themselves when accessing compromised social media accounts, or sending malicious email, such as phishing messages.\n\nAs alleged in the unsealed warrant, FBI investigators used undercover purchases to obtain access to the RSOCKS botnet in order to identify its backend infrastructure and its victims. The initial undercover purchase in early 2017 identified approximately 325,000 compromised victim devices throughout the world with numerous devices located within San Diego County. Through analysis of the victim devices, investigators determined that the RSOCKS botnet compromised the victim device by conducting brute force attacks. The RSOCKS backend servers maintained a persistent connection to the compromised device. Several large public and private entities have been victims of the RSOCKS botnet, including a university, a hotel, a television studio, and an electronics manufacturer, as well as home businesses and individuals. At three of the victim locations, with consent, investigators replaced the compromised devices with government-controlled computers (i.e., honeypots), and all three were subsequently compromised by RSOCKS. The FBI identified at least six victims in San Diego.\n\nThis case was investigated by the FBI and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan I. Shapiro of the Southern District of California and Ryan K.J. Dickey, Senior Counsel for the Department of Justice Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crimes and Intellectual Property Section. \u00a0The Department of Justice extends its appreciation to the authorities of Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, the Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs and private sector cybersecurity company Black Echo, LLC for their assistance provided throughout the investigation.\n\nIn September 2020, FBI Director Christopher Wray announced the FBI\u2019s new strategy for countering cyber threats. The strategy focuses on imposing risk and consequences on cyber adversaries through the FBI\u2019s unique authorities, world-class capabilities, and enduring partnerships. Victims are encouraged to report the incident online with the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3)www.ic3.gov.",

            "article_text": "Tampa, Florida \u2013 United States Attorney Roger B. Handberg announces the culmination of a transnational cybercrime investigation involving the xDedic Marketplace. According to court documents, the xDedic Marketplace was a website on the dark web that illegally sold login credentials (usernames and passwords) to servers located across the world and personally identifiable information\u2014dates of birth and Social Security numbers\u2014of U.S. residents. Once purchased, criminals used these servers to facilitate a wide range of illegal activity that included tax fraud and ransomware attacks. The xDedic administrators practiced exceptional operational security, operating the website across a widely distributed international network, and utilizing cryptocurrency in order to hide the locations of the Marketplace\u2019s underlying servers and the identities of its administrators, sellers, and buyers. In total, xDedic offered more than 700,000 compromised servers for sale, including at least 150,000 in the United States and at least 8,000 in Florida. Marketplace victims spanned the globe and industries, including local, state, and federal government infrastructure, hospitals, 911 and emergency services, call centers, major metropolitan transit authorities, accounting and law firms, pension funds, and universities.\n\nIn January 2019, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Middle District of Florida (Tampa Division) seized xDedic\u2019s domain names and dismantled the website\u2019s infrastructure, effectively ceasing its operation. The international operation to dismantle and seize this infrastructure was the result of close cooperation with law enforcement authorities in Belgium and Ukraine, the European law enforcement agency Europol, the National High Tech Crime Unit from the Dutch National Police, and the German Bundeskriminalamt.\n\nIn the years that followed the takedown of the xDedic Marketplace, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office investigated and charged individuals involved in every level of the website\u2019s operation, including its administrators, server sellers, and buyers. For example, Alexandru Habasescu and Pavlo Kharmanskyi were Marketplace administrators. Habasescu, who resided in Chisnau, Moldova, was the lead developer and technical mastermind for the Marketplace, while Kharmanskyi, who lived in Kiev, Ukraine, advertised for the website, paid administrators, and provided customer support to buyers. Habasescu was taken into custody in the Spanish Canary Islands in 2022 and extradited to the United States, while Kharmanskyi was arrested at the Miami International Airport in 2019 as he attempted to enter the United States. Habasescu and Kharmanskyi were sentenced to 41 and 30 months\u2019 imprisonment, respectively.\n\nMarketplace seller Dariy Pankov, a Russian national, was one of the highest sellers on the Marketplace by volume, listing for sale the credentials of more than 35,000 compromised servers located all over the world and obtaining more than $350,000 in illicit proceeds. Pankov\u2019s criminal activities were facilitated by a powerful malicious software program he developed named \u201cNLBrute,\u201d that was capable of compromising protected computers by decrypting login credentials. Pankov was taken into custody in the Republic of Georgia in 2022 and extradited to the United States. He was subsequently sentenced to 60 months in federal prison.\n\nNigerian national Allen Levinson was a prolific buyer on the Marketplace who held particular interest in purchasing access to U.S.-based Certified Public Accounting firms. He used the information he obtained from those servers to file hundreds of false tax returns with the United States government, requesting more than $60 million in fraudulent tax refunds. Levinson was taken into custody in the United Kingdom in 2020 and extradited to the United States. He was subsequently sentenced to 78 months in federal prison.\n\nMany of the charged defendants are foreign nationals and hold citizenship in countries that do not extradite their nationals, requiring the United States to locate and extradite subjects from countries that do.\u00a0 As identified in the table below, to date, 17 defendants have been charged and/or extradited to the United States.\n\n\n\nName\n\n(Age, Nationality)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffense of Conviction\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm of\n\nImprisonment\n\nAllen Levinson\n\n(31, Nigeria)\n\nConspiracy to Commit\n\nMail and Wire Fraud\n\n78 months\n\nT\u2019Andre McNeely\n\n(33, California)\n\nConspiracy to Commit\n\nMail and Wire Fraud\n\n78 months\n\nMichael Carr\n\n(33, California)\n\nConspiracy to Commit\n\nMail and Wire Fraud\n\n78 months\n\nDariy Pankov\n\n(29, Russia)\n\nConspiracy to Commit\n\nAccess Device and Computer Fraud\n\n60 months\n\nGlib Ivanov-Tolpintsev\n\n(29, Ukraine)\n\nConspiracy to Commit\n\nAccess Device and Computer Fraud\n\n48 months\n\nAlexandru Habasescu\n\n(31, Moldova)\n\nAccess Device Fraud\n\n\n\n41 months\n\nAdedotun Adejumo\n\n(45, Oklahoma)\n\nConspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud\n\n\n\n33 months\n\n\n\nPavlo Kharmanskyi\n\n(32, Ukraine)\n\nAccess Device Fraud\n\n\n\n30 months\n\nJoshua Spencer\n\n(29, New York)\n\nConspiracy to Commit\n\nAccess Device Fraud\n\n28 months\n\nIbrahim Jinadu\n\n(36, Georgia)\n\nConspiracy to Commit\n\nWire Fraud\n\n27 months\n\nBrandon Williams\n\n(34, California)\n\nConspiracy to Commit\n\nMail and Wire Fraud\n\n12 months\n\nHarold McKinzie\n\n(29, Illinois)\n\nWire Fraud\n\n5 years\u2019 probation\n\nBamidele Omotosho\n\n(42, Nigeria)\n\nConspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud\n\nSentence pending\n\nOlayemi Adafin\n\n(38, United Kingdom)\n\nConspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud\n\nSentence pending\n\nOlakunle Oyebanjo\n\n(29, United Kingdom)\n\nConspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud\n\nSentence pending\n\nAkinola Taylor\n\n(38, United Kingdom)\n\nConspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud\n\nSentence pending\n\nOluwarotimi Ogunlana\n\n(29, Texas)\n\nConspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud\n\nSentence pending\n\nIn addition to the individuals above, xDedic Marketplace buyers Olufemi Odedeyi (42, United Kingdom) and Oluwaseyi Shodipe (41, United Kingdom) have been charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Both and are pending extradition from the United Kingdom. Shodipe has also been charged with making false claims and theft of government funds. If convicted, Odedeyi and Shodipe each face a maximum penalty of 20 years in federal prison.\n\nThese cases were led by the Tampa Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Tampa Field Office of Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigation. Substantial assistance was provided by the IRS-CI Cyber Crimes Unit (Washington, D.C.), the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of International Affairs, and Homeland Security Investigations. This investigation also benefited greatly from cooperation with foreign law enforcement in Belgium, Georgia, Germany, Poland, Spain, the United Kingdom, Romania, Switzerland, Estonia, Latvia, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Lithuania, and Moldova. The cases are being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Rachel K. Jones, Carlton C. Gammons, and Suzanne Nebesky.",

            "article_text": "Russian National Fraudulently Obtained Entry to the United States Using Brazilian Alias to Attend a University in the District of Columbia and Obtain Information\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Sergey Vladimirovich Cherkasov (\u201cCherkasov\u201d), 37, a national of the Russian Federation who operated as an \u201cIllegal\u201d agent for a Russian Intelligence Service (\u201cRIS\u201d) under the Brazilian alias of Victor Muller Ferreira, was charged today for acting as an agent of a foreign power, visa fraud, bank fraud, wire fraud, and other charges stemming from his illegal activities in the United States. Cherkasov started acting as an Illegal agent in 2012 in Brazil using the Ferreira name, and he moved to the United States in 2018 after obtaining admission to a graduate school program at a University 1, a university located in the District of Columbia. Cherkasov is currently incarcerated in Brazil on fraud charges.\n\nAccording to a Criminal Complaint filed on March 24, 2023, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, between 2012 and April 2022. Cherkasov acted as an illegal agent of a RIS using a Brazilian cover identity. In October 2017, Cherkasov maintained his cover as a Brazilian national to apply to graduate programs in the United States, including University 1, and he obtained admission to University 1 at the behest of the RIS. Using that same fraudulent cover, Cherkasov fraudulently applied for, and obtained, a visa to enter the United States in 2017. In March 2018, Cherkasov obtained admission to University 1, and again fraudulently applied for, and obtained, a student visa to enter the United States. According to the complaint, after entering the United States, Cherkasov fraudulently opened bank accounts at a U.S. bank under the Brazilian alias Victor Muller Ferreira\u00a0 and obtained a U.S. driver\u2019s license from the Commonwealth of Virginia.\u00a0 Cherkasov further made connections to persons of interest in the United States and maintained communications with his RIS handlers. While in the United States, Cherkasov obtained information about U.S. persons that he passed to his RIS handlers. Cherkasov obtained his graduate degree using the fraudulent Ferreira identity from University 1, and left the United States in or about May 2020.\u00a0 Cherkasov continued his activities for the RIS after leaving the United States, and he continued to use his connections from University 1 to obtain information about U.S. foreign policy to provide to the RIS in 2021 and 2022. Cherkasov attempted to obtain employment at the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands, in April 2022. After being turned away by Dutch officials, Cherkasov returned to Brazil where he was arrested on fraud charges stemming from his use of the false Ferreira identity.\n\n\u201cWhen foreign adversaries, such as Russia, send undercover operatives into the United States, we will find them and prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law,\u201d said US Attorney Matthew M. Graves. \u201cSuch adversaries seek to operate in secret to undermine our national security in ways that could jeopardize the safety of our citizens. With our partners in the FBI, we will root out anyone who intends to do harm to the United States and bring them to justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor years, Cherkasov worked as an illegal agent for a Russian intelligence service and committed fraud against the United States,\u201d said David Sundberg, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office. \u201cToday\u2019s criminal complaint is a result of the hard work, determination, and collaborative efforts of the FBI and our international partners in a complex investigation holding him accountable for his attempts to collect intelligence on the United States at the behest of the Russian government.\u201d\n\nThis investigation was conducted by the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office and coordinated by the FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Division.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Tejpal S.

Turner of the FBI\u2019s New Haven Division made the announcement.\n\n\u201cFor over two decades, Peter Levashov operated botnets which enabled him to harvest personal information from infected computers, disseminate spam, and distribute malware used to facilitate multiple scams,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Benczkowski. \u201cWe are grateful to Spanish authorities for his previous arrest and extradition.\u00a0 Today\u2019s guilty plea demonstrates that the Department will collaborate with our international law enforcement partners to bring cybercriminals to justice, wherever they may be.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Levashov used the Kelihos botnet to distribute thousands of spam e-mails, harvest login credentials, and install malicious software on computers around the world,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Durham.\u00a0 \u201cHe also participated in online forums on which stolen identities, credit card information and cybercrime tools were traded and sold.\u00a0 For years, Mr. Levashov lived quite comfortably while his criminal behavior disrupted the lives of thousands of computer users.\u00a0 Thanks to the collaborative work of the FBI and our partners in law enforcement, private industry and academia, a prolific cybercriminal has been neutralized, and has now admitted his guilt in a U.S. courtroom.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday justice has finally arrived for Peter Levashov, who is perhaps better known in the cyber community by his online identity, Peter Severa,\u201d said FBI Special Agent in Charge Turner.\u00a0 \u201cThe FBI\u2019s New Haven Division has been engaged in a multiyear investigation of Levashov, with evidence gathered from a number of countries around the world.\u00a0\u00a0 Today\u2019s guilty plea should serve as an unequivocal reminder to all those who use the internet for illicit purposes:\u00a0 The FBI will pursue you regardless of what country you live in and the length of time it might take to secure your eventual arrest.\u00a0 As we move forward, no cyber criminal should rest easy.\u00a0 The men and women of the FBI\u2019s New Haven Division, along with the members of our Cyber Task Force and our many other federal, state, local, and tribal partners across the state, will continue to employ the same dedication and hard work, which made this effort such a success, to the continued protection of the citizens of Connecticut and the nation as a whole.\u201d\n\nAccording to court documents and statements made in court, a botnet is a network of computers infected with malicious software that allows a third party to control the entire computer network without the knowledge or consent of the computer owners.\u00a0 Since the late 1990s until his arrest in April 2017, Levashov controlled and operated multiple botnets, including the Storm, Waledac and Kelihos botnets, to harvest personal information and means of identification (including email addresses, usernames and logins, and passwords) from infected computers.\u00a0 To further the scheme, Levashov disseminated spam and distributed other malware, such as banking Trojans and ransomware, and advertised the Kelihos botnet spam and malware services to others for purchase in order to enrich himself.\u00a0 Over the course of his criminal career, Levashov participated in and moderated various online criminal forums on which stolen identities and credit cards, malware and other criminal tools of cybercrime were traded and sold.\n\nSpanish authorities arrested Levashov in Barcelona on April 7, 2017, based upon a criminal complaint and arrest warrant issued in the District of Connecticut.\u00a0 At the time of Levashov\u2019s arrest, Kelihos infected at least 50,000 computers.\n\nOn April 10, 2017, the Justice Department announced that it had taken action to dismantle the Kelihos botnet.\n\nOn April 20, 2017, a grand jury in the District of Connecticut returned an indictment charging Levashov with multiple offenses related to this scheme.\u00a0 Levashov was extradited to the United States in February.\n\nLevashov pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Robert N. Chatigny to one count of causing intentional damage to a protected computer, one count of conspiracy, one count of wire fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft.\n\nJudge Chatigny scheduled sentencing for Sept. 6, 2019.\u00a0 Levashov is detained pending sentencing.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s New Haven Division and Anchorage Division are investigating the case, with the assistance from the Spanish National Police.\u00a0 Assistant U.S. Attorneys Vanessa Richards and David Huang of the District of Connecticut and Senior Trial Attorney Anthony Teelucksingh of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section are prosecuting the case.\u00a0 The Criminal Division\u2019s Office of International Affairs handled the extradition in this matter, with assistance from the U.S. Marshals Service.\u00a0 The University of Alabama at Birmingham, ThreatStop, SpamHaus, Cisco, Cambridge University, and Cloudmark also provided invaluable assistance in the investigation and prosecution of Mr. Levashov.",

            "article_text": "The Justice Department today announced a multi-national effort to disrupt the Gameover Zeus Botnet \u2013 a global network of infected victim computers used by cyber criminals to steal millions of dollars from businesses and consumers \u2013 and unsealed criminal charges in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Omaha, Nebraska, against an administrator of the botnet.   In a separate action, U.S. and foreign law enforcement officials worked together to seize computer servers central to the malicious software or \u201cmalware\u201d known as Cryptolocker, a form of \u201cransomware\u201d that encrypts the files on victims\u2019 computers until they pay a ransom.\n\nDeputy Attorney General James M. Cole, Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, FBI Executive Assistant Director Robert Anderson Jr., U.S. Attorney David J. Hickton of the Western District of Pennsylvania, U.S. Attorney Deborah R. Gilg of the District of Nebraska, and Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) Deputy Under Secretary Dr. Phyllis Schneck made the announcement.Victims of Gameover Zeus may use the following website created by DHS\u2019s Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) for assistance in removing the malware:https://www.us-cert.gov/gameoverzeus.\u201cThis operationdisrupteda globalbotnetthat had stolen millions from businesses and consumers as wellas a complexransomware scheme thatsecretlyencryptedhard drivesandthendemanded payments for giving usersaccess to theirownfiles and data,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Cole.   \u201cWesucceeded indisabling Gameover Zeus and Cryptolocker only becausewe blended innovative legal and technical tactics with traditional law enforcement tools anddeveloped strong working relationships withprivate industry experts andlaw enforcement counterpartsin more than 10 countriesaround the world.\u201d\u201cThese schemes were highly sophisticated and immensely lucrative, and the cyber criminals did not make them easy to reach or disrupt,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Caldwell.   \u201cBut under the leadership of the Justice Department, U.S. law enforcement, foreign partners in more than 10 different countries and numerous private sector partners joined together to disrupt both these schemes.   Through these court-authorized operations, we have started to repair the damage the cyber criminals have caused over the past few years, we are helping victims regain control of their own computers, and we are protecting future potential victims from attack.\u201d\u201cGameover Zeus is the most sophisticated botnet the FBI and our allies have ever attempted to disrupt,\u201d said FBI Executive Assistant Director Anderson.   \u201cThe efforts announced today are a direct result of the effective relationships we have with our partners in the private sector, international law enforcement, and within the U.S. government.\u201d\u201cThe borderless, insidious nature of computer hacking and cybertheft requires us to be bold and imaginative,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Hickton.\u00a0 \u201cWe take this action on behalf of hundreds of thousands of computer users who were unwittingly infected and victimized.\u201d\u201cThe sophisticated computer malware targeting of U.S. victims by a global criminal enterprise demonstrates the grave threat of cybercrime to our citizens,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Gilg.\u00a0 \u201cWe are grateful for the outstanding collaboration of our international and U.S. law enforcement partners in this successful investigation.\u201d\u201cThe FBI has demonstrated great leadership in continuing to help combat cyber crime, and our international and private sector partners have made enormous contributions as well,\u201d said Deputy Under Secretary Schneck.   \u201cThis collective effort reflects our \u2018whole-of-government\u2019 approach to cybersecurity.\u00a0 DHS is proud to support our partners in helping to identify compromised computers, sharing that information rapidly, and developing useful information and mitigation strategies to help the owners of hacked systems.\u201dGameover Zeus Administrator Charged\n\nA federal grand jury in Pittsburgh unsealed a 14-count indictment against Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev, 30, of Anapa, Russian Federation, charging him with conspiracy, computer hacking, wire fraud,   bank fraud and money laundering in connection with his alleged role as an administrator of the Gameover Zeus botnet.   Bogachev was also charged by criminal complaint in Omaha with conspiracy to commit bank fraud related to his alleged involvement in the operation of a prior variant of Zeus malware known as \u201cJabber Zeus.\u201dIn a separate civil injunction application filed by the United States in federal court in Pittsburgh, Bogachev is identified as a leader of a tightly knit gang of cyber criminals based in Russia and Ukraine that is responsible for the development and operation of both the Gameover Zeus and Cryptolocker schemes.   An investigation led in Washington, D.C., identified the Gameover Zeus network as a common distribution mechanism for Cryptolocker.   Unsolicited emails containing an infected file purporting to be a voicemail or shipping confirmation are also widely used to distribute Cryptolocker.   When opened, those attachments infect victims\u2019 computers.   Bogachev is alleged in the civil filing to be an administrator of both Gameover Zeus and Cryptolocker.   The injunction filing further alleges that Bogachev is linked to the well-known online nicknames \u201cSlavik\u201d and \u201cPollingsoon,\u201d among others.   The criminal complaint filed in Omaha alleges that Bogachev also used \u201cLucky12345,\u201d a well-known online moniker previously the subject of criminal charges in September 2012 that were unsealed in Omaha on April 11, 2014.Disruption of Gameover Zeus BotnetGameover Zeus, also known as \u201cPeer-to-Peer Zeus,\u201d is an extremely sophisticated type of malware designed to steal banking and other credentials from the computers it infects.   Unknown to their rightful owners, the infected computers also secretly become part of a global network of compromised computers known as a \u201cbotnet,\u201d a powerful online tool that cyber criminals can use for numerous criminal purposes besides stealing confidential information from the infected machines themselves.   Gameover Zeus, which first emerged around September 2011, is the latest version of Zeus malware that began appearing at least as early as 2007.   Gameover Zeus\u2019s decentralized, peer-to-peer structure differentiates it from earlier Zeus variants.   Security researchers estimate that between 500,000 and 1 million computers worldwide are infected with Gameover Zeus, and that approximately 25 percent of the infected computers are located in the United States.   The principal purpose of the botnet is to capture banking credentials from infected computers.   Those credentials are then used to initiate or re-direct wire transfers to accounts overseas that are controlled by cyber criminals.   The FBI estimates that Gameover Zeus is responsible for more than $100 million in losses.The Gameover Zeus botnet operates silently on victim computers by directing those computers to reach out to receive commands from other computers in the botnet and to funnel stolen banking credentials back to the criminals who control the botnet.   For this reason, in addition to the criminal charges announced today, the United States obtained civil and criminal court orders in federal court in Pittsburgh authorizing measures to redirect the automated requests by victim computers for additional instructions away from the criminal operators to substitute servers established pursuant to court order.   The order authorizes the FBI to obtain the Internet Protocol addresses of the victim computers reaching out to the substitute servers and to provide that information to US-CERT to distribute to other countries\u2019 CERTS and private industry to assist victims in removing the Gameover Zeus malware from their computers.   At no point during the operation did the FBI or law enforcement access the content of any of the victims' computers or electronic communications.Besides the United States, law enforcement from the Australian Federal Police; the National Police of the Netherlands National High Tech Crime Unit; European Cybercrime Centre (EC3); Germany\u2019s Bundeskriminalamt; France\u2019s Police Judiciare; Italy\u2019s Polizia Postale e delle Comunicazioni; Japan\u2019s National Police Agency; Luxembourg\u2019s Police Grand Ducale; New Zealand Police; the Royal Canadian Mounted Police; Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Internal Affairs \u2013 Division for Combating Cyber Crime; and the United Kingdom\u2019s National Crime Agency participated in the operation.   The Defense Criminal Investigative Service of the U.S. Department of Defense also participated in the investigation.Invaluable technical assistance was provided by Dell SecureWorks and CrowdStrike.   Numerous other companies also provided assistance, including facilitating efforts by victims to remediate the damage to their computers inflicted by Gameover Zeus.   These companies include Microsoft Corporation, Abuse.ch, Afilias, F-Secure, Level 3 Communications, McAfee, Neustar, Shadowserver, Anubis Networks, Symantec, Heimdal Security, Sophos and Trend Micro.The DHS National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC), which houses the US-CERT, plays a key role intriaging and collaboratively responding to the threat by providing technical assistance to information system operators, disseminating timely mitigation strategies to known victims, and sharing actionable information to the broader community to help prevent further infections.Disruption of CryptolockerIn addition to the disruption operation against Gameover Zeus, the Justice Department led a separate multi-national action to disrupt the malware known as Cryptolocker (sometimes written as \u201cCryptoLocker\u201d), which began appearing about September 2013 and is also a highly sophisticated malware that uses cryptographic key pairs to encrypt the computer files of its victims.   Victims are forced to pay hundreds of dollars and often as much as $700 or more to receive the key necessary to unlock their files.   If the victim does not pay the ransom, it is impossible to recover their files.Security researchers estimate that, as of April 2014, Cryptolocker had infected more than 234,000 computers, with approximately half of those in the United States.   One estimate indicates that more than $27 million in ransom payments were made in just the first two months since Cryptolocker emerged.The law enforcement actions against Cryptolocker are the result of an ongoing criminal investigation by the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office, in coordination with law enforcement counterparts from Canada, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, United Kingdom and Ukraine.Companies such as Dell SecureWorks and Deloitte Cyber Risk Services also assisted in the operation against Cryptolocker, as did Carnegie Mellon University and the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech).   The joint effort aided the FBI in identifying and seizing computer servers acting as command and control hubs for the Cryptolocker malware.The FBI\u2019s Omaha and Pittsburgh Field Offices led both malware disruptions and conducted the investigation of Bogachev.   The prosecution in Pittsburgh is being handled by Assistant U.S. Attorney Shardul Desai of the Western District of Pennsylvania, and the prosecution in Omaha by Trial Attorney William A. Hall of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Steven Russell of the District of Nebraska.   The civil action to disrupt the Gameover Zeus botnet and Cryptolocker malware is led by Trial Attorneys Ethan Arenson and David Aaron of CCIPS and Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael A. Comber of the Western District of Pennsylvania.The Criminal Division\u2019s Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance throughout the criminal and civil investigations.\n\nThe details contained in the indictment, criminal complaint and related pleadings aremerely accusations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.Anyone claiming an interest in any of the property seized or actions enjoined pursuant to the court orders described in this release is advised to visit the following website for notice of the full contents of the orders:http://www.justice.gov/opa/gameover-zeus.html.\n\n",

            "article_text": "Remarks as Prepared for Delivery\n\nThank you, to the Cybersecurity Coalition and the Cyber Threat Alliance, for the invitation to speak at CyberNext DC.\n\nWhen I was preparing my remarks, I noticed that the theme of the conference is \u201cPrivacy, Partnerships, Protection.\u201d That\u2019s a helpful framework for my remarks today, because I want to talk about all three of those.\n\nProtection\n\nI will start with protection, which is at the core of law enforcement\u2019s mission. Investigating crimes, building cases, and holding individuals, entities, and even nations, accountable, is a large part of how the Justice Department protects the public and contributes to cybersecurity.\n\nIt is fairly straightforward why: criminal prosecution is a means of reinforcing the difference between right and wrong, between acceptable state behavior, on the one hand, and that which violates accepted norms of conduct on the Internet.\n\nAnd imposing consequences, whether through imprisonment, fines or sanctions, or other tools, is a way of deterring malicious conduct, by raising its costs (personal, reputational, financial, and otherwise). As the First Pillar of the Administration\u2019s recent National Cyber Strategy puts it, \u201cLaw enforcement actions to combat criminal cyber activity serve as an instrument of national power by, among other things, deterring those activities.\u201d\n\nThe last year has seen significant prosecutions of foreign hackers, including those acting on behalf of foreign governments, for computer intrusions and attacks. It is worth recounting some of them, for what they show about the Department\u2019s priorities and the lengths we will go in doing our part to enforce the law and protect the public.\n\nBoyusec\n\nIn October 2017, the Department announced charges against three Chinese nationals and residents who worked for a purported Internet security firm known as Guangzhou Bo Yu Information Technology Company Limited (a/k/a \u201cBoyusec\u201d).\n\nThe defendants are accused of computer hacking and trade secret theft between December 2015 and March 2016. Among other things, the indictment alleges they stole a prominent economist\u2019s e-mail messages and trade secrets related to global navigation technology that \u201chad no military application,\u201d but was marketed to construction, land survey, and agricultural sectors.\n\nNow, the Indictment does not allege action by the Chinese state. But what made the defendants\u2019 alleged trade secret theft notable (besides the fact that they worked for a firm that marketed its cybersecurity services), was that it continued after China committed in September 2015 (1) not to steal trade secrets or confidential business information \u201cwith the intent of providing competitive advantages\u201d to its own companies, and (2) to cooperate with requests to investigate cybercrimes emanating from its territory, which this did.\n\nThe September 2015 commitment ushered in broad, public acceptance of a norm against computer espionage for economic benefit (soon accepted by all of the other members of the G-20). And it was incumbent on the U.S. government to hold China to the commitments it made.\n\nAs we previously revealed, the Boyusec indictment was returned under seal, while we sought China\u2019s assistance in investigating and putting a stop to Boyusec\u2019s activities.\u00a0 When we received \u201cno meaningful response\u201d to those requests, there was no longer a basis to keep the charges sealed, and we made them public.\n\nThereafter, the U.S. Trade Representative cited the Boyusec indictment in its March 2018 study of China\u2019s trade practices under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which concluded that a combination of China\u2019s practices are unreasonable, including its outbound investment policies and sponsorship of unauthorized computer intrusions.\n\nIn this way, you can draw a direct line from the DOJ\u2019s indictment of China\u2019s military officers in 2014, through China\u2019s commitments in 2015, to our monitoring for compliance with those commitments, and this Administration\u2019s response to China\u2019s economic aggression, which includes state-sponsored theft of intellectual property.\n\nMabna Institute\n\nIn March of 2018, the Department announced charges against nine Iranian nationals associated with the Mabna Institute in Iran for a massive coordinated hacking campaign that targeted intellectual property and other research at more than 300 colleges and universities around the world.\n\nThe very purpose of the Mabna Institute, according to the indictment, was to assist Iranian universities and scientific and research organizations obtain access to scientific resources outside Iran. It contracted with the Iranian government (including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.) as well as private organizations, and it sold some of the stolen data on websites marketed to Iranian customers.\n\nThe indictment alleges the campaign was executed in three phases:\n\n\n\nOver the course of four years, the Mabna Institute and these nine individuals are accused of stealing more than 31 terabytes of academic data, intellectual property, and communications.\u00a0 That amounts to 7.75 trillion sheets of paper. (And that\u2019s printing double-sided.) U.S. universities had collectively spent $3.4 billion to have access to that intellectual property.\n\nThe charges themselves virtually guarantee the defendants cannot leave Iran without arrest. And on the day they were announced, the Department of the Treasury, leveraging our investigation, sanctioned the Mabna Institute and the defendants \u201cfor engaging in malicious cyber-enabled activities related to the significant misappropriation of economic resources or personal identifiers for private financial gain,\u201d under a provision of Executive Order 13694 (2015).\n\nDPRK\n\nIn September, the Department unsealed a massive complaint, outlining some of the government\u2019s proof behind its prior, higher-level attribution that North Korea launched a destructive malware attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014, stole $81 million from the Bank of Bangladesh in 2016 (and attempted to steal at least $1 billion from other banks), and created the malware used in the WannaCry 2.0 global ransomware attack last year.\n\nThe complaint lays out more than 170 pages of evidence that a single conspiracy, backed by the North Korean government, was responsible for those crimes among others, and it identifies one of the men who was a member of that conspiracy.\n\nAs the complaint makes clear, however, the U.S. government was not alone in this investigation.\u00a0 The complaint cites to security researchers whose expertise and dogged pursuit of the threat was critical to the allegations of the complaint. Our investigative efforts not only validate theirs, they yield specific information that expanded the security community\u2019s understanding of the Lazarus Group (a popular name for the intrusion set) and how best to protect against it.\n\nUSADA, et al.\n\nFinally, this brings me to this morning\u2019s announcement of an indictment in Pittsburgh (where the first public national security cyber case was unsealed in 2014).\n\nA grand jury there has indicted seven Russian GRU officers with an international hacking conspiracy targeting international anti-doping organizations, among others.\n\nAmong the conspiracy\u2019s goals: to publicize stolen information as part of an influence and disinformation campaign designed to undermine, retaliate against, and otherwise delegitimize those organizations, which had publicly exposed Russia\u2019s state-sponsored athlete doping program; and to damage the reputations of athletes around the world by falsely claiming that such athletes were using banned or performance-enhancing drugs.\n\nThe indictment also alleges how, when the efforts to obtain remote access failed to achieve their objectives, the GRU sent several of the defendants to locations where their targets were physically located. Then, using specialized equipment, those close access teams hacked the WiFi networks used by the victim organizations or their personnel (like hotel networks where they were staying).\n\nThere are some who question this approach, of criminally investigating and charging hackers sponsored by foreign states, often because we have not yet arrested the defendants I have described above.\n\nIt is probably easy to forget that, until relatively recently, such charges were unheard of, because for a long time, we viewed the problem of foreign state-sponsored hacking through the lens of intelligence collection alone, without regard to disruption and deterrence (which are our objectives in confronting terrorism, espionage, and other challenging national security threats).\n\nBut imagine a world in which there arenocriminal charges, no detailed, formal allegation of wrongdoing (which the government is prepared to stand behind in court). The private sector would be left alone to accuse the guilty, without recourse.\u00a0 What message doesthatsend to a foreign hacker?\n\nCertainly not the same message we have sent to Karim Baratov, the 23-year-old hacker who worked with FSB officers to hack into e-mail accounts around the world, who was recently sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment after being arrested in Canada and waiving extradition.\u00a0 Or to Ardit Firizi, the Kosovar who was arrested in Malaysia, pled guilty here, and was sentenced to 20 years in prison, for giving ISIS PII for 1,300 military and government personnel, which he stole from the network of a U.S. retailer. Or to countless other hackers arrested on purely criminal charges, who thought they were safe from the consequences for their actions, because they operated under regimes that ignored (if not sponsored) their crimes.\n\nAnd even in the cases above (where we have yet to apprehend a defendant), the charges were never the end of the story: whether it is trade remedies, sanctions, contributions to network defense, or diplomatic efforts to rally likeminded nations to confront an adversary together, all of those charges served a greater purpose.\n\nPrivacy\n\nSo often, privacy is spoken about as if it is a value opposed to law enforcement. But each of the cases I described vindicates the right to privacy, whether it is the right of a company to control who has access to its trade secrets, or of professors to prevent their hard-earned research from being stolen, preempted, and plagiarized; the expectation of privacy we have in our e-mail communications or our medical records.\n\nPrivacy isn\u2019t dead, but it is under attack, and much of what we are doing through law enforcement honors the privacy of innocent persons, by investigating those who would breach it. As the Sony case as well as the GRU cases illustrate, data breaches are not just trees that fall in forests when no one else is around; their consequences are often painfully visible to their victims (and the rest of the world).\n\nBut leaving aside these examples of DOXing, I want to shift gears for a moment, to talk about the Department of Justice\u2019s changing approach to personal privacy, and why the privacy of your personal information can be a matter of national security.\n\nThis portion of my remarks comes from a different vantage point, from my experience with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (or CFIUS), where I represent the Department.\n\nNow CFIUS, for those of you who are not familiar, is a committee of federal departments that reviews foreign acquisitions of U.S. businesses for national security risk. When it finds risks that cannot be mitigated, it recommends actions to the President, who has the authority to prohibit a transaction.\n\nCFIUS does not review the vast majority of foreign investments in the United States. Even among those transactions we do review, we usually conclude that there are no unresolved national security concern.\n\nA classic example of the risk CFIUS examines arises when the target of an acquisition is in close proximity to a DOD facility. But an increasing focus of DOJ\u2019s work on the committee relates to data security, to the potential national security consequences of personal information ending up in the wrong hands. The kind of information I am talking about is collected every day, from thousands or even millions of consumers. Transaction information, PII, health information, even smartphone habits.\n\nNow you might ask why the security of that kind of consumer data would be relevant to CFIUS, whose mission is to protect national security. And ten years ago, or so, such information did not seem like it would be. But a few things have changed.\n\nFirst, the volume and variety of data has increased exponentially. Information that was not previously stored in a digital form now is. And the rate at which data are being created, the velocity of data growth, is increasing.\n\nConsider the increasing connectedness of physical devices and sensors, often referred to as the Internet of Things. Everything from medical devices, such as pacemakers, to fitness trackers, to the control systems that deliver water and power to our businesses and homes. One estimate predicts the number of Internet-connected devices will reach more than 20 billion by 2020.\u00a0 These Internet-connected devices have increased the volume, variety, and velocity of information.\n\nTake cars, for example. Not long ago, a car was essentially a mechanical device, an engine with seats that moved you from point A to point B. Whatever limited electronic components it had were self-contained.\n\nToday\u2019s cars, by contrast, contain communication devices, sensors, GPS navigation, and other computers with a variety of functions. They allow drivers to check fuel levels and tire pressure on their cell phones, track a stolen vehicle over the Internet, call for help from the car in an emergency, and access the same entertainment they\u2019re used to enjoying in their home.\n\nAnother example: the universe of health information is rapidly expanding.\u00a0 More people are taking advantage of DNA testing to learn about their health, longevity, paternity, and ancestry.\u00a0 According to one 2017 report, the market for testing has become an $830 million industry. Meanwhile, our smartphones and watches are accruing ever more precise information about our health and habits.\n\nNew forms and pools of data merely add to what has been collected for years, and it remains possible for a determined adversary to steal it, given enough time and resources.\n\nA second insight we have developed is that information that seems unimportant, or purely personal, or irrelevant, can, in fact, be used to threaten national security.\n\nIn January, a 20-year-old Australian student discovered that open source maps of where Fitbit and other fitness device users frequently go could be used to identify military facilities in remote areas.\u00a0 As the Washington Post put it, \u201cIn war zones and deserts in countries such as Iraq and Syria, the heat map becomes almost entirely dark \u2014 except for scattered pinpricks of activity. Zooming in on those areas brings into focus the locations and outlines of known U.S. military bases, as well as other unknown and potentially sensitive sites \u2014 presumably because American soldiers and other personnel are using fitness trackers as they move around.\u201d\n\nSome data might be valuable, in and of themselves, like a military secret or the admin password to an industrial control system. But other data are valuable because they are part of what a hacker or other malicious actor needs to achieve their objective, to get to their target.\n\nThe information a modern car collects provides insight into the users\u2019 network of contacts, entertainment preferences, driving habits, and locations visited on a regular basis.\n\nIn the aggregate, this information provides commercial and cultural insights that might have monetary or other use. But this information about the \u201cpattern of life\u201d of a company\u2019s CEO or government official could also be used to target that individual.\n\nBy themselves, the music you favor, your children\u2019s birthdates, your anniversary, and the addresses you\u2019ve lived at\u2014these are not national security secrets.\n\nBut with that information, a criminal hacker could answer password reset questions or use a password cracker to obtain control of your accounts. And even if it is a personal (as opposed to a professional) account, and I might not care about the last photoyouposted from your vacation, masquerading as you online makes it that much easier to trick the people who know you into clicking on a link or otherwise compromising their network security.\n\nOur third insight is this: the fact that most people in a data set might not be targets themselves (in fact, that only a few might be) provides little comfort. Anyone on any form of social media has learned that we are more connected than it seems. In 2016, Facebook reported that its American users were separated by fewer than 3.5 degrees of separation on average. Extrapolating what that means offline, anyone\u2019s information can be useful more for what it tells us about her brother, the CISO at a major bank, or her aunt in the intelligence community.\n\nOur concerns are exacerbated by the fact that traditional methods of de-identification of data (such as anonymization or encryption of content) may be defeated, by, for example, sensor and geolocation data, or by cross-referencing sanitized data sets against others.\n\nResearchers from two studies several years ago reported that, with a sufficient pool of data, they could distinguish a unique user of a cellphone, or a credit card, based on just four geolocations or transactions, respectively, with at least 90 percent accuracy. I cannot vouch for the methodology of those studies, but they give me pause when I think about the potential that nefarious actors could have access to large pools of such data without legal process.\n\nWhat does this mean for companies, and the way they should think about their data?\n\nFirst, and most important, they should not assume that hackers are not interested in the data or that it cannot be used to threaten national security.\n\nSecond, cybersecurity policies and practices need to keep pace as businesses grow and deploy new technologies, such as biometric identification or artificial intelligence.\n\nThird, joint ventures or other arrangements with foreign parties may provide network access or other elements of control over data. Businesses should consider the ways an aggressive foreign intelligence service could exploit that data,in light of other data it might have from other sources.\n\nFourth, and finally, report computer intrusions, because the breach you think is merely a private matter, may in fact be a matter of national security.\n\nPartnerships\n\nThis brings me to the final theme, partnerships. The cases we bring require true partnerships, between law enforcement and the victims who cooperate with us; between us and the intelligence community and other components of the government; and, increasingly, between our government and the governments of likeminded nations, whether in gathering and sharing information, validating our conclusions, extraditing defendants, or imposing other consequences.\n\nBut as much as I believe in the value of criminal prosecutions, we have always known that we will not prosecute our way to cybersecurity. The partnership that may be most critical to our future is among the professionals in and out of government who share common goals. Which is why one of the National Security Division\u2019s greatest successes this year did not result in a criminal charge.\n\nIn May, agents of the FBI were tracking a virulent botnet infecting home and office routers around the world, attributed to the same group responsible for today\u2019s indictment, known to some as \u201cFancy Bear.\u201d\n\nThe botnet was growing at an alarming rate by that point, and private sector researchers studying it told us they felt an increasing urgency to publish what they knew, so that affected router manufacturers, ISPs, and others could take steps to protect the public before it was too late.\n\nThere was no easy technical solution to this pernicious malware. Its second stage (which could steal information and even brick the device) could be cleared from memory with a simple restart, but if a router were infected, complete mitigation could be virtually impossible, short of replacement, because the first stage of malware (the actors\u2019 toe-hold in the system) would just call out for instructions to reinfect.\n\nWith no time to waste, in little more than a week (including late nights and a weekend), agents and prosecutors devised the best mitigation plan they could under the circumstances.\n\nIn a coordinated action,\n\nResearchers drew attention to the botnet at the same time that the FBI executed the orders and blasted out a public service advisory to restart your router, purging the second stage of malware and causing the first stage to call out for instructions, now to the FBI\u2019s server, so that help could be alerted. These efforts were our best effort to identify and remediate the infection worldwide in the time available, before Fancy Bear actors learned of the vulnerabilities in the C2 infrastructure through the research firm\u2019s imminent announcement.\n\nLast week, Cisco Talos, the research firm I mentioned, published a follow-up to its original report. It found that the VPNFilter malware possessed even greater capabilities than previously identified, in the form of third-stage malware modules that provide additional capabilities to map networks, exploit systems connected to infected devices, and obfuscate or encrypt malicious traffic.\n\nBut Cisco Talos also reported, based on information from partners as well as its own analysis, that \u201cit appears that VPNFilter has been entirely neutralized since\u201d the effort I described earlier by a coalition of international partners (which included the Cyber Threat Alliance). So far, they said, there have been no signs of the actors attempting to reconnect with the devices that remain infected with the pernicious first stage of the malware. Not bad, for the first (but I promise you, not the last) effort to mitigate a botnet tied to nation-state actors.\n\nOnce, there was no one. Attribution was whispered in classified channels alone. We spoke, haltingly at first, of cyber threats \u201cemanating from Asia.\u201d Then the U.S. led the way, calling out the malicious behavior of specific foreign states, first in speeches, then by indictment.\n\nToday, we are joined by three other nations in attributing specific conduct to Russia.\n\nI cannot tell you where our commitment to partnership will take us next. But I can tell you, based on this, that there is reason for hope, and to continue working together to maintain an \u201copen, interoperable, reliable, and secure Internet.\u201d",

            "article_text": "Spy Ring Attempted to Collect Economic Intelligence and Recruit New York City Residents as Intelligence Sources\n\nEvgeny Buryakov, aka \u201cZhenya,\u201d Worked Under \u201cNon-Official Cover\u201d as a Bank Employee in Manhattan\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder, Assistant Attorney General for National Security John P. Carlin, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara for the Southern District of New York and Assistant Director Randall C. Coleman of the FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Division announced charges today against Evgeny Buryakov, aka \u201cZhenya,\u201d Igor Sporyshev and Victor Podobnyy in connection with Buryakov\u2019s service\u00a0as a covert intelligence agent on behalf of the Russian Federation (Russia) in New York City, without notifying the U.S. Attorney General of Buryakov\u2019s status as an agent of Russia, as required by federal law.\u00a0 Buryakov was placed under arrest earlier today in Bronx, New York, and is scheduled to appear before U.S. Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn in federal court in Manhattan later today.\u00a0 Sporyshev and Podobnyy no longer reside in the United States and have not been arrested.\u00a0 By virtue of their prior positions in the United States on behalf of Russia, both of them were protected by diplomatic immunity from arrest and prosecution while in the United States.\n\n\u201cThese charges demonstrate our firm commitment to combating attempts by covert agents to illegally gather intelligence and recruit spies within the United States,\u201d said Attorney General Holder.\u00a0 \u201cWe will use every tool at our disposal to identify and hold accountable foreign agents operating inside this country \u2013 no matter how deep their cover. \u00a0I want to thank the dedicated men and women of the FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Division and New York Field Office, the National Security Division\u2019s Counterespionage Section and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York for their skilled handling of this complex and highly sensitive matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe attempt by foreign nations to illegally gather economic and other intelligence information in the United States through covert agents is a direct threat to the national security of the United States, and it exemplifies why counterespionage is a top priority of the National Security Division,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Carlin.\u00a0 \u201cI want to thank the FBI\u2019s New York Field Office and Counterintelligence Division as well as the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York for their continued effort to conduct these highly complex and sensitive counterespionage investigations and prosecutions, and for their continued close partnership with the National Security Division and the Counterespionage Section.\u201d\n\n\u201cFollowing our previous prosecution with the FBI of Russian spies, who were expelled from the United States in 2010 when their plan to infiltrate upper levels of U.S. business and government was revealed, the arrest of Evgeny Buryakov and the charges against him and his co-defendants make clear that \u2013 more than two decades after the presumptive end of the Cold War \u2013 Russian spies continue to seek to operate in our midst under cover of secrecy,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Bharara. \u00a0\u201cIndeed, the presence of a Russian banker in New York would in itself hardly draw attention today, which is why these alleged spies may have thought Buryakov would blend in.\u00a0 What they could not do without drawing the attention of the FBI was engage in espionage.\u00a0 New York City may be more hospitable to Russian businessmen than during the Cold War, but my office and the FBI remain vigilant to the illegal intelligence-gathering activities of other nations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis investigation is one of many that highlight the determined and prolific efforts by foreign governments to target Americans for the purposes of collecting intelligence and stealing secrets,\u201d Assistant Director Coleman.\u00a0 \u201cThis case is especially egregious as it demonstrates the actions of a foreign intelligence service to integrate a covert intelligence agent into American society under the cover of an employee in the financial sector. \u00a0Espionage is as pervasive today as it has even been, and FBI counterintelligence teams will continue to aggressively investigate and expose hostile foreign intelligence activities conducted on U.S. soil.\u201d\n\nAccording to the complaint unsealed in Manhattan federal court today:\n\nBuryakov worked in the United States as an agent of Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence agency, known as the SVR.\u00a0 Buryakov operated under \u201cnon-official cover,\u201d meaning he entered and remained in the United States as a private citizen, posing as an employee in the Manhattan office of a Russian bank.\u00a0 SVR agents operating under such non-official cover \u2013 sometimes referred to as NOCs \u2013 typically are subject to less scrutiny by the host government, and, in many cases, are never identified as intelligence agents by the host government.\u00a0 As a result, a NOC is an extremely valuable intelligence asset for the SVR.\n\nFederal law prohibits individuals from acting as agents of foreign governments within the United States without prior notification to the U.S. Attorney General. \u00a0Department of Justice records indicate that Buryakov has never notified the U.S. Attorney General that he is, in fact, an agent of Russia.\n\nSporyshev and Podobnyy are also SVR agents who worked in the United States to gather intelligence on behalf of Russia by posing as official representatives of Russia.\u00a0 From Nov. 22, 2010, to Nov. 21, 2014, Sporyshev served as a trade representative of the Russian Federation in New York.\u00a0 From Dec. 13, 2012, to Sept. 12, 2013, Podobnyy served as an attach\u00e9 to the Permanent Mission of the Russian Federation to the United Nations.\u00a0 Based on their official government postings on behalf of Russia, Sporyshev and Podobnyy are exempt from notifying the U.S. Attorney General of the true nature of their work.\u00a0 However, that exemption does not permit them to conspire with, or aid and abet, Buryakov in his work as an unregistered agent of Russia operating within the United States.\n\nThe intelligence-gathering efforts of Sporyshev and Podobnyy included, among other things, attempting to recruit New York City residents as intelligence sources for Russia; tasking Buryakov to gather intelligence; and transmitting intelligence reports prepared by Buryakov back to SVR headquarters in Moscow.\u00a0 Specifically, during the course of the charged offenses, Sporyshev was responsible for relaying assignments from the SVR to Buryakov, and Sporyshev and Podobnyy were responsible for analyzing and reporting back to the SVR about the fruits of Buryakov\u2019s intelligence-gathering efforts.\n\nThe directives from the SVR to Buryakov, Sporyshev and Podobnyy, as well as to other covert SVR agents acting within the United States, included requests to gather intelligence on, among other subjects, potential U.S. sanctions against Russian banks and the United States\u2019 efforts to develop alternative energy resources.\n\nClandestine Meetings and Communications\n\nDuring the course of their work as covert SVR agents in the United States, Buryakov, Sporyshev and Podobnyy regularly met and communicated using clandestine methods and coded messages, in order to exchange intelligence-related information while shielding their associations with one another as SVR agents.\u00a0 These efforts were designed, among other things, to preserve their respective covers as an employee of a bank in Manhattan (Buryakov), a trade representative of the Russian Federation in New York (Sporyshev) and an attach\u00e9 to the Permanent Mission of the Russian Federation to the United Nations (Podobnyy).\u00a0 In particular, the defendants worked to safeguard Buryakov\u2019s work as a NOC.\n\nSporyshev and Podobnyy acted as covert intermediaries for Buryakov to communicate with the SVR on intelligence-related matters.\u00a0 As an agent posing as someone without any official ties to the Russian government or the SVR, Buryakov was unable to access the SVR New York Office \u2013 which is located within an office maintained by Russia in New York City \u2013 without potentially alerting others to his association with the SVR.\u00a0 As such, Buryakov required the assistance of other SVR agents, like Sporyshev and Podobnyy, to exchange communications and information with the SVR through the communications systems located in the SVR New York Office.\n\nFrom as early as March 2012 through as recently as mid-September 2014, the FBI has conducted physical or electronic surveillance of Buryakov and Sporyshev engaging in over 48 brief meetings, several of which involved Buryakov passing a bag, magazine or slip of paper to Sporyshev.\u00a0 These meetings typically took place outdoors, where the risk of effective surveillance was reduced relative to an indoor location.\n\nThese meetings were nearly always preceded by a short telephone call between Buryakov and Sporyshev, during which one of the men typically told the other that he had an item to give to him.\u00a0 Typically, during these telephone calls, which were intercepted by the FBI, the item in question was referred to as some non-specific ticket, book, list or other ordinary item (e.g., umbrella or hat).\n\nSubsequently, at each meeting surveilled by the FBI, Buryakov and Sporyshev met and sometimes exchanged documents or other small items. \u00a0Notably, despite discussing on approximately 12 occasions the need to meet to transfer \u201ctickets,\u201d Buryakov and Sporyshev, were \u2013 other than one occasion where they discussed going to a movie \u2013 never observed attending, or discussing in any detail, events that would typically require tickets, such as a sporting event or concert.\u00a0 In fact, Buryakov and Sporyshev used this coded language to signal that they needed to meet, and then met to exchange intelligence information.\n\nAttempts by Sporyshev and Podobnyy to Recruit Intelligence Sources in New York City\n\nIn numerous recorded communications, Sporyshev and Podobnyy discussed their attempts to recruit U.S. residents, including several individuals employed by major companies, and several young women with ties to a major university located in New York City (University-1), as intelligence sources for the SVR.\u00a0 On these recordings, the defendants discussed the potential value of these sources and identified particular sources by use of a \u201csource name,\u201d which appears to be a coded name.\u00a0 In addition, during these recordings, Sporyshev and Podobnyy discussed the efforts of other SVR agents to recruit a number of other Russian-origin individuals associated with University-1 as intelligence sources.\n\nFor example, Sporyshev and Podobnyy discussed Podobnyy\u2019s efforts to recruit a male working as a consultant in New York City as an intelligence source.\u00a0 During this conversation, Podobnyy explained his source recruitment method, which included cheating, promising favors and then discarding the intelligence source once the relevant information was obtained by the SVR: \u201cThis is intelligence method to cheat. . . . You promise a favor for a favor. \u00a0You get the documents from him and tell him to go [expletive] himself.\u201d\n\nIn other recorded conversations, Sporyshev and Podobnyy made clear that they worked for the SVR.\u00a0 For example, on Jan. 31, 2013, Sporyshev and another SVR agent not charged in the complaint (CC-1) had a discussion inside the SVR New York Office about their contracts with the SVR.\u00a0 Sporyshev stated that, \u201cEveryone has a five-year contract,\u201d and explained, in response to CC-1\u2019s question about reimbursement for the travel of SVR agents\u2019 family members, that \u201ctravel for military personnel and their families on authorized home leave is paid, and in our, in our SVR, this, the payment for getting to and from the duty station.\u201d\u00a0 In addition, on April 25, 2013, Sporyshev and Podobnyy discussed the use of nontraditional cover for Russian intelligence officers and, in particular, the Illegals program that ended with the arrest of 10 \u201cdeep cover\u201d SVR agents in July 2010.\n\nBuryakov\u2019s Intelligence Taskings\n\nSporyshev was responsible for relaying intelligence assignments from the SVR to Buryakov.\u00a0 The FBI obtained electronic recordings of several conversations relating to such intelligence directives being communicated to and carried out by Buryakov in his position as an SVR agent acting under non-official cover.\u00a0 For example, on May 21, 2013, Sporyshev called Buryakov to ask for Buryakov\u2019s help in formulating questions to be used for intelligence gathering purposes by others associated with a leading Russian state-owned news organization (the News Organization).\u00a0 Buryakov responded by supplying Sporyshev with a particular line of questioning about the New York Stock Exchange for use by the News Organization.\n\nBuryakov\u2019s Receipt of Purported Official U.S. Government Documents\n\nIn the summer of 2014, Buryakov met numerous times with a confidential source working for the FBI (CS-1).\u00a0 CS-1 posed as the representative of a wealthy investor looking to develop casinos in Russia.\u00a0 During the course of these meetings, and consistent with his interests as a Russian intelligence agent, Buryakov demonstrated his strong desire to obtain information about subjects far outside the scope of his work as a bank employee.\u00a0 During these meetings, Buryakov also accepted documents that CS-1 claimed he had obtained from a U.S. government agency and which purportedly contained information potentially useful to Russia, including information about U.S. sanctions against Russia.\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\n\nBuryakov, 39, Sporyshev, 40, and Podobnyy, 27, are charged on two counts. \u00a0The first count charges the defendants with participating in a conspiracy for Buryakov to act in the United States as an agent of a foreign government without first notifying the Attorney General, and carries a statutory maximum penalty of five years in prison.\u00a0 The second count charges Buryakov with acting in the United States as an agent of a foreign government without first notifying the Attorney General, and charges Sporyshev and Podobnyy with aiding and abetting that offense.\u00a0 The second count carries a statutory maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.\u00a0 The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendants will be determined by a judge.\n\nThe Attorney General is grateful for the investigative work of the FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Division.\n\nThe prosecution is being handled by Senior Trial Attorney Heather Schmidt of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterespionage Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Adam Fee, Ian McGinley and Anna M. Skotko for the Southern District of New York\u2019s Terrorism and International Narcotics Unit.\n\nThe charges in the Complaint are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\n\nBuryakov, et al Complaint",

            "article_text": "Stanislav Romanyuk, 39, a citizen of Ukraine last residing in Estonia, was sentenced today to 33 months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release, for his role in a scheme to violate U.S. export laws and regulations by attempting to smuggle a dual-use export-controlled item to Russia.\n\nAccording to court documents and statements made in court, beginning in 2018, Romanyuk, who operated Estonia-based BY Trade O\u00dc, conspired with Vadims Ananics and Eriks Mamonovs, both citizens of Latvia who operated the Latvia-based corporation CNC Weld. Romanyuk, Ananics, and Mamonovs violated U.S. export laws and regulations with individuals in Russia and a Russian company to smuggle to Russia a 500 Series CPWZ Precision Jig Grinder that was manufactured in Connecticut.\n\nA jig grinder is a high-precision grinding machine system that does not require a license to export to European Union countries, but does require a license for export and reexport to Russia because of its potential application in nuclear proliferation and defense programs. Romanyuk and his co-conspirators knew that the jig grinder could not be exported from the United States to Russia, and they did not apply for, receive, or possess a license of authorization from the U.S. Department of Commerce to export or reexport the jig grinder to Russia, as required by the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 and the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), which restrict the export of items that could make a significant contribution to the military potential of other nations or that could be detrimental to U.S. foreign policy and national security.\n\nIn April 2019, Romanyuk brokered the sale of the jig grinder from By Trade O\u00dc to a Russian company using funds wired to it from the Russian company to purchase the jig grinder from Sapphire Universal LLP, a company in Latvia. Sapphire Universal, which Romanyuk knew was in the business of obtaining dual-use items from the United States for sale in Russia, used CNC Weld as the claimed recipient and end-user of the jig grinder because no license was required to export the jig grinder to Latvia from the United States. In August 2019, to finalize the purchase of the jig grinder, Ananics and others traveled to Bridgeport, Connecticut, where Ananics informed the sellers that the jig grinder was being purchased for the benefit of CNC Weld. In September 2021, Romanyuk provided a false statement to Estonian authorities about the jig grinder transaction in order to cover up his involvement in this scheme.\n\nU.S. authorities, working with Latvian authorities, intercepted the jig grinder in Riga, Latvia, before it was to be shipped to Russia. Approximately $826,000 in funds involved in the purchase of the jig grinder were subsequently\u00a0forfeited, and a substantial portion of the forfeited funds were\u00a0transferred to Estonia\u00a0to provide aid to Ukraine.\n\nRomanyuk was arrested on June 13, 2022, in Estonia. On May 23, he pleaded guilty to international money laundering conspiracy. He has been detained since his arrest. Ananics and Mamonovs pleaded guilty to related charges.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division, Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement Matthew S. Axelrod of the Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security, Executive Assistant Director Robert Wells of the FBI\u2019s National Security Branch, and U.S. Attorney Vanessa Roberts Avery for the District of Connecticut, Special Agent in Charge Michael J. Krol of Homeland Security Investigations in New England made the announcement.\n\nThe Homeland Security Investigation (HSI) Field Offices in New Haven and the Hague, Netherlands; HSI Counter Proliferation Mission Center; U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Office of Export Enforcement in Boston and Portland, Oregon; FBI; and Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation investigated the case. The Prosecutor-General\u2019s Office of the Republic of Latvia, the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office of the Republic of Estonia, Latvian Tax and Customs Police, Estonian Tax and Customs Board, and the Latvian State Police assisted in the investigation.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorneys Konstantin Lantsman, Stephanie Levick, and Daniel George for the District of Connecticut and Trial Attorney Brendan Geary of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section prosecuted the case. The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs provided valuable assistance.\n\nThis case is being prosecuted through the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF) Program and is being supported by OCDETF\u2019s International Organized Crime Intelligence and Operations Center (IOC-2). OCDETF identifies, disrupts and dismantles drug traffickers, money launderers, gangs and transnational criminal organizations through a prosecutor-led and intelligence-driven approach that leverages the strengths of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. Additional information about OCDETF can be found atwww.justice.gov/OCDETF.\n\nThe investigation was coordinated through the Justice Department\u2019s Task Force KleptoCapture, an interagency law enforcement task force dedicated to enforcing the sweeping sanctions, export controls, and economic countermeasures that the United States, along with its foreign allies and partners, has imposed in response to Russia\u2019s unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine. Announced by the Attorney General on March 2, 2022, and under the leadership of the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the task force will continue to leverage all of the department\u2019s tools and authorities to combat efforts to evade or undermine the collective actions taken by the U.S. government in response to Russian military aggression.",

            "article_text": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. \u2014 Dr. Emilio Louis Cruz III, 61, of Carson,  Calif., was sentenced today by United States District Judge Morrison C. England  Jr. to three years and two months in prison and ordered to pay $601,581 in  restitution for his role in a conspiracy to commit Medicare fraud, United  States Attorney Benjamin B. Wagner announced.\n\nAccording to court documents, Cruz earned an undergraduate  degree from Johns Hopkins University and his medical degree from Yale  University. He held medical licenses in three states and was board certified in  neurology. According to his plea agreement and the testimony heard at the trial  of Cruz\u2019s co-defendants, doctors Ramanathan Prakash, Alexander Popov, and Lana  LeChabrier, and a man named Vardges Egiazarian owned and controlled three  health care clinics in Sacramento, Richmond, and Carmichael from February 2006  through August 2008. Over this time period, Cruz ran the practice at the  Carmichael clinic on 3609 Mission Avenue. He established a Medicare provider  number for the clinic and established a bank account into which Medicare funds  were deposited. Hundreds of claims were submitted to Medicare seeking  reimbursement for services allegedly performed at the Carmichael clinic under  Cruz\u2019s care. Cruz, however, never treated a single patient. Indeed, during the  majority of the time that the Carmichael clinic operated, he was living and  practicing in North Dakota. A similar pattern was followed at the other two  clinics operated by Egiazarian, and not one of the physicians submitting bills  to Medicare ever treated a single patient.\n\nAccording to evidence at trial, the clinic\u2019s patients were  primarily elderly and non-English speaking. They were recruited and transported  to the clinics by individuals who were paid according to the number of patients  they brought to the facilities. Rather than being charged a co-payment, the  patients were paid for their time and the use of their Medicare eligibility,  generally $100 per visit. False charts were created stating that each patient  received comprehensive exams and a broad array of diagnostic tests. Few of  these tests were ever performed, none were performed based on any medical need,  and clinic employees filled out other portions of the charts using preprinted  templates. Some clinic employees admitted to performing various tests on  themselves, and placing the results in patient files.\n\nIn all, the three clinics submitted more than $5 million worth  of fraudulent claims to Medicare, $1.7 million of which was actually paid. With  respect to claims submitted for services purportedly provided by Cruz at the  Carmichael clinic, Medicare paid $601,581.\n\nThe only defendants to go to trial, doctors Prakash, Popov,  and LeChabrier, were found guilty by a jury on July 8, 2011, of conspiracy to  commit healthcare fraud and various counts of healthcare fraud.\n\nThis case is the product of an investigation by the Office of  the Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services and the  Federal Bureau of Investigation. Assistant United States Attorneys Philip  Ferrari and Jean M. Hobler are prosecuting the case.\n\nOthers who were charged in this matter include:",

            "article_text": "WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 The Justice Department today announced a multi-national effort to disrupt the Gameover Zeus Botnet \u2013 a global network of infected victim computers used by cyber criminals to steal millions of dollars from businesses and consumers \u2013 and unsealed criminal charges in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Omaha, Nebraska, against an administrator of the botnet.  In a separate action, U.S. and foreign law enforcement officials worked together to seize computer servers central to the malicious software or \u201cmalware\u201d known as Cryptolocker, a form of \u201cransomware\u201d that encrypts the files on victims\u2019 computers until they pay a ransom.\n\nDeputy Attorney General James M. Cole, Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, FBI Executive Assistant Director Robert Anderson Jr., U.S. Attorney David J. Hickton of the Western District of Pennsylvania, U.S. Attorney Deborah R. Gilg of the District of Nebraska, and Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) Deputy Under Secretary Dr. Phyllis Schneck made the announcement.\n\nVictims of Gameover Zeus may use the following website created by DHS\u2019s Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) for assistance in removing the malware:https://www.us-cert.gov/gameoverzeus.\n\n\u201cThis operation disrupted a global botnet that had stolen millions from businesses and consumers as well as a complex ransomware scheme that secretly encrypted hard drives and then demanded payments for giving users access to their own files and data,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Cole.  \u201cWe succeeded in disabling Gameover Zeus and Cryptolocker only because we blended innovative legal and technical tactics with traditional law enforcement tools and developed strong working relationships with private industry experts and law enforcement counterparts in more than 10 countries around the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese schemes were highly sophisticated and immensely lucrative, and the cyber criminals did not make them easy to reach or disrupt,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Caldwell.  \u201cBut under the leadership of the Justice Department, U.S. law enforcement, foreign partners in more than 10 different countries and numerous private sector partners joined together to disrupt both these schemes.  Through these court-authorized operations, we have started to repair the damage the cyber criminals have caused over the past few years, we are helping victims regain control of their own computers, and we are protecting future potential victims from attack.\u201d\n\n\u201cGameover Zeus is the most sophisticated botnet the FBI and our allies have ever attempted to disrupt,\u201d said FBI Executive Assistant Director Anderson.  \u201cThe efforts announced today are a direct result of the effective relationships we have with our partners in the private sector, international law enforcement, and within the U.S. government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe borderless, insidious nature of computer hacking and cybertheft requires us to be bold and imaginative,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Hickton.  \u201cWe take this action on behalf of hundreds of thousands of computer users who were unwittingly infected and victimized.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sophisticated computer malware targeting of U.S. victims by a global criminal enterprise demonstrates the grave threat of cybercrime to our citizens,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Gilg.  \u201cWe are grateful for the outstanding collaboration of our international and U.S. law enforcement partners in this successful investigation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe FBI has demonstrated great leadership in continuing to help combat cyber crime, and our international and private sector partners have made enormous contributions as well,\u201d said Deputy Under Secretary Schneck.  \u201cThis collective effort reflects our \u2018whole-of-government\u2019 approach to cybersecurity.  DHS is proud to support our partners in helping to identify compromised computers, sharing that information rapidly, and developing useful information and mitigation strategies to help the owners of hacked systems.\u201d\n\nGameover Zeus Administrator Charged\n\nA federal grand jury in Pittsburgh unsealed a 14-count indictment against Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev, 30, of Anapa, Russian Federation, charging him with conspiracy, computer hacking, wire fraud,  bank fraud and money laundering in connection with his alleged role as an administrator of the Gameover Zeus botnet.  Bogachev was also charged by criminal complaint in Omaha with conspiracy to commit bank fraud related to his alleged involvement in the operation of a prior variant of Zeus malware known as \u201cJabber Zeus.\u201d\n\nIn a separate civil injunction application filed by the United States in federal court in Pittsburgh, Bogachev is identified as a leader of a tightly knit gang of cyber criminals based in Russia and Ukraine that is responsible for the development and operation of both the Gameover Zeus and Cryptolocker schemes.  An investigation led in Washington, D.C., identified the Gameover Zeus network as a common distribution mechanism for Cryptolocker.  Unsolicited emails containing an infected file purporting to be a voicemail or shipping confirmation are also widely used to distribute Cryptolocker.  When opened, those attachments infect victims\u2019 computers.  Bogachev is alleged in the civil filing to be an administrator of both Gameover Zeus and Cryptolocker.  The injunction filing further alleges that Bogachev is linked to the well-known online nicknames \u201cSlavik\u201d and \u201cPollingsoon,\u201d among others.  The criminal complaint filed in Omaha alleges that Bogachev also used \u201cLucky12345,\u201d a well-known online moniker previously the subject of criminal charges in September 2012 that were unsealed in Omaha on April 11, 2014.\n\nDisruption of Gameover Zeus Botnet\n\nGameover Zeus, also known as \u201cPeer-to-Peer Zeus,\u201d is an extremely sophisticated type of malware designed to steal banking and other credentials from the computers it infects.  Unknown to their rightful owners, the infected computers also secretly become part of a global network of compromised computers known as a \u201cbotnet,\u201d a powerful online tool that cyber criminals can use for numerous criminal purposes besides stealing confidential information from the infected machines themselves.  Gameover Zeus, which first emerged around September 2011, is the latest version of Zeus malware that began appearing at least as early as 2007.  Gameover Zeus\u2019s decentralized, peer-to-peer structure differentiates it from earlier Zeus variants.  Security researchers estimate that between 500,000 and 1 million computers worldwide are infected with Gameover Zeus, and that approximately 25 percent of the infected computers are located in the United States.  The principal purpose of the botnet is to capture banking credentials from infected computers.  Those credentials are then used to initiate or re-direct wire transfers to accounts overseas that are controlled by cyber criminals.  The FBI estimates that Gameover Zeus is responsible for more than $100 million in losses.\n\nThe Gameover Zeus botnet operates silently on victim computers by directing those computers to reach out to receive commands from other computers in the botnet and to funnel stolen banking credentials back to the criminals who control the botnet.  For this reason, in addition to the criminal charges announced today, the United States obtained civil and criminal court orders in federal court in Pittsburgh authorizing measures to redirect the automated requests by victim computers for additional instructions away from the criminal operators to substitute servers established pursuant to court order.  The order authorizes the FBI to obtain the Internet Protocol addresses of the victim computers reaching out to the substitute servers and to provide that information to US-CERT to distribute to other countries\u2019 CERTS and private industry to assist victims in removing the Gameover Zeus malware from their computers.  At no point during the operation did the FBI or law enforcement access the content of any of the victims' computers or electronic communications.\n\nBesides the United States, law enforcement from the Australian Federal Police; the National Police of the Netherlands National High Tech Crime Unit; European Cybercrime Centre (EC3); Germany\u2019s Bundeskriminalamt; France\u2019s Police Judiciare; Italy\u2019s Polizia Postale e delle Comunicazioni; Japan\u2019s National Police Agency; Luxembourg\u2019s Police Grand Ducale; New Zealand Police; the Royal Canadian Mounted Police; Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Internal Affairs \u2013 Division for Combating Cyber Crime; and the United Kingdom\u2019s National Crime Agency participated in the operation.  The Defense Criminal Investigative Service of the U.S. Department of Defense also participated in the investigation.\n\nInvaluable technical assistance was provided by Dell SecureWorks and CrowdStrike.  Numerous other companies also provided assistance, including facilitating efforts by victims to remediate the damage to their computers inflicted by Gameover Zeus.  These companies include Microsoft Corporation, Abuse.ch, Afilias, F-Secure, Level 3 Communications, McAfee, Neustar, Shadowserver, Anubis Networks and Symantec.\n\nThe DHS National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC), which houses the US-CERT, plays a key role in triaging and collaboratively responding to the threat by providing technical assistance to information system operators, disseminating timely mitigation strategies to known victims, and sharing actionable information to the broader community to help prevent further infections.\n\nDisruption of Cryptolocker\n\nIn addition to the disruption operation against Gameover Zeus, the Justice Department led a separate multi-national action to disrupt the malware known as Cryptolocker (sometimes written as \u201cCryptoLocker\u201d), which began appearing about September 2013 and is also a highly sophisticated malware that uses cryptographic key pairs to encrypt the computer files of its victims.  Victims are forced to pay hundreds of dollars and often as much as $700 or more to receive the key necessary to unlock their files.  If the victim does not pay the ransom, it is impossible to recover their files.\n\nSecurity researchers estimate that, as of April 2014, Cryptolocker had infected more than 234,000 computers, with approximately half of those in the United States.  One estimate indicates that more than $27 million in ransom payments were made in just the first two months since Cryptolocker emerged.\n\nThe law enforcement actions against Cryptolocker are the result of an ongoing criminal investigation by the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office, in coordination with law enforcement counterparts from Canada, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, United Kingdom and Ukraine.\n\nCompanies such as Dell SecureWorks and Deloitte Cyber Risk Services also assisted in the operation against Cryptolocker, as did Carnegie Mellon University and the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech).  The joint effort aided the FBI in identifying and seizing computer servers acting as command and control hubs for the Cryptolocker malware.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s Omaha and Pittsburgh Field Offices led both malware disruptions and conducted the investigation of Bogachev.  The prosecution in Pittsburgh is being handled by Assistant U.S. Attorney Shardul Desai of the Western District of Pennsylvania, and the prosecution in Omaha by Trial Attorney William A. Hall of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Steven Russell of the District of Nebraska.  The civil action to disrupt the Gameover Zeus botnet and Cryptolocker malware is led by Trial Attorneys Ethan Arenson and David Aaron of CCIPS and Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael A. Comber of the Western District of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Criminal Division\u2019s Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance throughout the criminal and civil investigations.\n\nThe details contained in the indictment, criminal complaint and related pleadings are merely accusations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\n\nAnyone claiming an interest in any of the property seized or actions enjoined pursuant to the court orders described in this release is advised to visit the following website for notice of the full contents of the orders:http://www.justice.gov/opa/gameover-zeus.html.",

            "article_text": "A federal grand jury in Spokane, Washington, returned an indictment earlier this month charging two hackers, both nationals and residents of the People\u2019s Republic of China (China), with hacking into the computer systems of hundreds of victim companies, governments, non-governmental organizations, and individual dissidents, clergy, and democratic and human rights activists in the United States and abroad, including Hong Kong and China. \u00a0The defendants in some instances acted for their own personal financial gain, and in others for the benefit of the MSS or other Chinese government agencies.\u00a0 The hackers stole terabytes of data which comprised a sophisticated and prolific threat to U.S. networks.\n\nThe 11-count indictment alleges LI Xiaoyu (\u674e\u5578\u5b87), 34, and DONG Jiazhi (\u8463\u5bb6\u5fd7), 33, who were trained in computer applications technologies at the same Chinese university, conducted a hacking campaign lasting more than ten years to the present, targeting companies in countries with high technology industries, including the United States, Australia, Belgium, Germany, Japan, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Spain, South Korea, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.\u00a0 Targeted industries included, among others, high tech manufacturing; medical device, civil, and industrial engineering; business, educational, and gaming software; solar energy; pharmaceuticals; defense. \u00a0In at least one instance, the hackers sought to extort cryptocurrency from a victim entity, by threatening to release the victim\u2019s stolen source code on the Internet.\u00a0 More recently, the defendants probed for vulnerabilities in computer networks of companies developing COVID-19 vaccines, testing technology, and treatments.\n\nThe charges were announced by Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers; FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich; U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Washington William D. Hyslop; and Special Agent in Charge of the FBI\u2019s Seattle Field Division\u00a0 Raymond Duda.\n\n\u201cChina has now taken its place, alongside Russia, Iran and North Korea, in that shameful club of nations that provide a safe haven for cyber criminals in exchange\u00a0for those criminals being \u2018on call\u2019 to work for the benefit of the state, here to feed the Chinese Communist party\u2019s insatiable hunger for American and other non-Chinese companies\u2019 hard-earned intellectual property, including COVID-19 research,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s indictment demonstrates the serious consequences the Chinese MSS and its proxies will face if they continue to deploy malicious cyber tactics to either steal what they cannot create or silence what they do not want to hear,\u201d said FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich. \u201cCybercrimes directed by the Chinese government\u2019s intelligence services not only threaten the United States but also every other country that supports fair play, international norms, and the rule of law, and it also seriously undermines China's desire to become a respected leader in world affairs. The FBI and our international partners will not stand idly by to this threat, and we are committed to holding the Chinese government accountable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe cybercrime hacking occurring here was first discovered on computers of the Department of Energy\u2019s Hanford Site in Eastern Washington.\u00a0 As the grand jury charged, the computer systems of many businesses, individuals and agencies throughout the United States and worldwide have been hacked and compromised with a huge array of sensitive and valuable trade secrets, technologies, data, and personal information being stolen.\u00a0 The hackers operated from China both for their own gain and with the assistance and for the benefit of the Chinese government\u2019s Ministry of State Security.\u00a0 This prosecution is occurring as a result of the combined unwavering efforts of the National Security Division of the Department of Justice, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Washington, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\u00a0 We seek justice for these victims and others affected and we intend to prosecute these defendants for their alleged crimes,\u201d said U.S. Attorney William D. Hyslop for the District Eastern District of Washington.\n\n\"The complicated nature of cyber investigations is only exacerbated when the criminal is backed by the resources of a foreign government. The nature and value of the material stolen by these hackers cannot just be measured in dollars and was indicative of being state driven. This case demonstrates the FBI's dedication to pursuing these criminals no matter who is sanctioning their activities,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Raymond Duda of the FBI\u2019s Seattle Division.\n\nAccording to the indictment, to gain initial access to victim networks, the defendants primarily exploited publicly known software vulnerabilities in popular web server software, web application development suites, and software collaboration programs.\u00a0 In some cases, those vulnerabilities were newly announced, meaning that many users would not have installed patches to correct the vulnerability.\u00a0 The defendants also targeted insecure default configurations in common applications.\u00a0 The defendants used their initial unauthorized access to place malicious web shell programs (e.g., the \u201cChina Chopper\u201d web shell) and credential-stealing software on victim networks, which allowed them to remotely execute commands on victim computers.\n\nTo conceal the theft of information from victim networks and otherwise evade detection, the defendants typically packaged victim data in encrypted Roshal Archive Compressed files (RAR files), changed RAR file and victim documents\u2019 names and extensions (e.g., from \u201c.rar\u201d to \u201c.jpg\u201d) and system timestamps, and concealed programs and documents at innocuous-seeming locations on victim networks and in victim networks\u2019 \u201crecycle bins.\u201d\u00a0 The defendants frequently returned to re-victimize companies, government entities, and organizations from which they had previously stolen data, in some cases years after the initial successful data theft.\u00a0 In several instances, however, the defendants were unsuccessful in this regard, due to the efforts of the FBI and network defenders.\n\nThe indictment charges the defendants with conspiring to steal trade secrets from at least eight known victims, which consisted of technology designs, manufacturing processes, test mechanisms and results, source code, and pharmaceutical chemical structures. \u00a0Such information would give competitors with a market edge by providing insight into proprietary business plans and savings on research and development costs in creating competing products.\n\nThe defendants are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets, which carries a maximum sentence of ten years in prison; one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; one count of unauthorized access of a computer, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; and seven counts of aggravated identity theft, which each carries a mandatory sentence of two non-consecutive years in prison. \u00a0The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencings of the defendants will be determined by the assigned judge.\n\nThe investigation was conducted jointly by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Washington, the National Security Division of the Department of Justice, and the FBI\u2019s Spokane Resident Agency and San Antonio and Norfolk Field Offices.\u00a0 The FBI\u2019s Cyber Division assisted in the investigation and, along with \u00a0FBI\u2019s Cyber Assistant Legal Attach\u00e9s and Legal Attach\u00e9s in countries around the world, provided essential support.\u00a0 Numerous victims cooperated and provided valuable assistance in the investigation.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney James Goeke of the Eastern District of Washington and Trial Attorney Scott McCulloch of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting this case.\n\nThe details contained in the charging document are allegations.\u00a0 The defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.",

Lynch recognized 376 department employees for their distinguished public service today at the 64thAnnual Attorney General\u2019s Awards Ceremony.\u00a0 Forty-seven other individuals outside of the department were also honored for their work.\u00a0 This annual ceremony recognizes individuals for their outstanding service and dedication to carrying out the missions of the Department of Justice.\n\nIn the District of New Jersey, three individuals \u2013 Counsel to the U.S. Attorney John M. Fietkiewicz and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Dennis C. Carletta and Peter W. Gaeta \u2013 were honored with awards.\n\n\u201cThe Attorney General\u2019s Awards provide us with a rare opportunity to honor the efforts of outstanding department employees and our invaluable partners across the federal government and at the state and local levels,\u201d Attorney General Lynch said.\u00a0 \u201cTheir work has made our nation \u2013 and our world \u2013 stronger, safer and more just, and I am proud of and inspired by each and every one of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m enormously proud of the three attorneys from our office who are being honored with these awards,\u201d U.S. Attorney Paul J. Fishman, District of New Jersey, said. \u201cJohn, Dennis and Peter exemplify the outstanding professionalism and commitment to justice we strive for every day. These awards honor them, but also all of the men and women in our office, who work so hard every day on behalf of the people of New Jersey and across the country.\u201d\n\nIn the District of New Jersey, the following individuals were recognized for the following awards:\n\nTheClaudia J. Flynn Award for Professional Responsibilityrecognizes a department attorney who has made significant contributions in the area of professional responsibility by successfully handling a sensitive and challenging professional responsibility issue in an exemplary fashion and/or leading efforts to ensure that department attorneys carry out their duties in accordance with the rules of professional conduct.\n\nFietkiewicz is recognized for his sustained, outstanding leadership and invaluable contributions to ensure that department prosecutors carry out their duties in compliance with the highest ethical standards.\u00a0 With superior dedication and effort, he has gone to extraordinary lengths to advise and train innumerable department prosecutors, providing the tools and resources necessary to perform their work in the most ethical and professional way possible.\u00a0 With his considerable experience and exceptional judgment, he is leading the district in successfully addressing the overlap between the legal and ethical duty of disclosure, one of the most important professional responsibility issues facing federal prosecutors in decades.\u00a0 His unfailing commitment to upholding and inspiring others to the highest standards of professionalism has been a model to his peers within and outside the department.\u00a0 He worked closely with Claudia Flynn during her service at the department, and he embodies the integrity, professionalism and strength of character that marked Flynn\u2019s life and work.\n\nTheAttorney General\u2019sAward for Excellence in Law Enforcementrecognizes outstanding professional achievements by law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice.\n\nThe award recognizes, from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office of the District of New Jersey, Assistant U.S. Attorneys Carletta and Gaeta.\n\nIn December 2011, the FBI opened a five-year investigation into ABN Universal Inc.\u00a0 Early investigative techniques revealed the U.S.-based owner and operator of ABN was Alexander Brazhnikov.\u00a0 Through an exhaustive use of human sources, video surveillance, forensic reconstruction, grand jury subpoenas, search warrants, Title III surveillance of emails and computer analysis, the investigation revealed that ABN was procuring dual-use microelectronics from U.S.-based manufacturers on behalf of Russian companies directly associated with the Russian military and intelligence services.\u00a0 Moreover, employees of ABN were devaluing the price of exported products to Russia and using front company addresses in Moscow, an offshore virtual private network and an international network of shell companies to conceal the intended end-users from U.S. law enforcement.\u00a0 The investigative team worked diligently to overcome each of these obfuscation techniques to ultimately reveal the totality of Brazhnikov\u2019s criminal offenses.\u00a0 As a result of the investigation, in June 2014, an arrest warrant for Brazhnikov was issued for his illegal smuggling of export controlled U.S.-sourced goods to Russia and for conducting $65 million in money laundering.\u00a0 In June 2015, Brazhnikov pleaded guilty to conspiracy to smuggle goods from the U.S., conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\u00a0 Brazhnikov also admitted to smuggling microelectronics to Russian defense contractors known to supply the Russian military and intelligence services, to include two Russian nuclear warhead design institutes.\u00a0 As a result of his guilty plea, the District Court of New Jersey issued a money judgment against Brazhnikov for $65 million.",

Demers.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s indictment demonstrates the serious consequences the Chinese Communist Party will face if it continues to deploy malicious cyber tactics to either steal what they cannot create or silence what they do not want to hear,\u201d said FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich. \u201cCybercrimes directed by the Chinese government\u2019s intelligence services not only threaten the United States but also every other country that supports fair play, international norms, and the rule of law, and it also seriously undermines China's desire to become a respected leader in world affairs. The FBI and our international partners will not stand idly by to this threat, and we are committed to holding the Chinese Communist Party accountable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe cybercrime hacking occurring here was first discovered on computers of the Department of Energy\u2019s Hanford Site in Eastern Washington. As the grand jury charged, the computer systems of many businesses, individuals and agencies throughout the United States and worldwide have been hacked and compromised with a huge array of sensitive and valuable trade secrets, technologies, data, and personal information being stolen. The hackers operated from China both for their own gain and with the assistance and for the benefit of the Chinese government\u2019s Ministry of State Security. This prosecution is occurring as a result of the combined unwavering efforts of the National Security Division of the Department of Justice, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Washington, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. We seek justice for these victims and others affected and we intend to prosecute these defendants for their alleged crimes,\u201d said U.S. Attorney William D. Hyslop for the District Eastern District of Washington.\n\n\"The complicated nature of cyber investigations is only exacerbated when the criminal is backed by the resources of a foreign government. The nature and value of the material stolen by these hackers cannot just be measured in dollars and was indicative of being state driven. This case demonstrates the FBI's dedication to pursuing these criminals no matter who is sanctioning their activities,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Raymond Duda of the FBI\u2019s Seattle Division.\n\nAccording to the indictment, to gain initial access to victim networks, the defendants primarily exploited publicly known software vulnerabilities in popular web server software, web application development suites, and software collaboration programs. In some cases, those vulnerabilities were newly announced, meaning that many users would not have installed patches to correct the vulnerability. The defendants also targeted insecure default configurations in common applications. The defendants used their initial unauthorized access to place malicious web shell programs (e.g., the \u201cChina Chopper\u201d web shell) and credential-stealing software on victim networks, which allowed them to remotely execute commands on victim computers.\n\nTo conceal the theft of information from victim networks and otherwise evade detection, the defendants typically packaged victim data in encrypted Roshal Archive Compressed files (RAR files), changed RAR file and victim documents\u2019 names and extensions (e.g., from \u201c.rar\u201d to \u201c.jpg\u201d) and system timestamps, and concealed programs and documents at innocuous-seeming locations on victim networks and in victim networks\u2019 \u201crecycle bins.\u201d The defendants frequently returned to re-victimize companies, government entities, and organizations from which they had previously stolen data, in some cases years after the initial successful data theft. In several instances, however, the defendants were unsuccessful in this regard, due to the efforts of the FBI and network defenders.\n\nThe indictment charges the defendants with conspiring to steal trade secrets from at least eight known victims, which consisted of technology designs, manufacturing processes, test mechanisms and results, source code, and pharmaceutical chemical structures. Such information would give competitors with a market edge by providing insight into proprietary business plans and savings on research and development costs in creating competing products.\n\nThe defendants are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets, which carries a maximum sentence of ten years in prison; one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; one count of unauthorized access of a computer, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; and seven counts of aggravated identity theft, which each carries a mandatory sentence of two non-consecutive years in prison. The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencings of the defendants will be determined by the assigned judge.\n\nThe investigation was conducted jointly by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Washington, the National Security Division of the Department of Justice, and the FBI\u2019s Spokane Resident Agency and San Antonio Field Office. The FBI\u2019s Cyber Division assisted in the investigation and, along with FBI\u2019s Cyber Assistant Legal Attach\u00e9s and Legal Attach\u00e9s in countries around the world, provided essential support. Numerous victims cooperated and provided valuable assistance in the investigation.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney James Goeke of the Eastern District of Washington and Trial Attorney Scott McCulloch of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting this case.\n\nThe details contained in the charging document are allegations. The defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.\n\nThe year 2020 marks the 150th anniversary of the Department of Justice.

            "article_text": "A federal grand jury in Tampa, Florida, returned a superseding indictment charging four U.S. citizens and three Russian nationals with working on behalf of the Russian government and in conjunction with the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) to conduct a multi-year foreign malign influence campaign in the United States. Among other conduct, the superseding indictment alleges that the Russian defendants recruited, funded and directed U.S. political groups to act as unregistered illegal agents of the Russian government and sow discord and spread pro-Russian propaganda; the indicted intelligence officers, in particular, participated in covertly funding and directing candidates for local office within the United States.\n\nAdditionally, in a separate case out of the District of Columbia, a criminal complaint was unsealed charging Russian national Natalia Burlinova with conspiring with an FSB officer to act as an illegal agent of Russia in the United States.\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s foreign intelligence service allegedly weaponized our First Amendment rights \u2013 freedoms Russia denies its own citizens \u2013 to divide Americans and interfere in elections in the United States,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division. \u201cThe department will not hesitate to expose and prosecute those who sow discord and corrupt U.S. elections in service of hostile foreign interests, regardless of whether the culprits are U.S. citizens or foreign individuals abroad.\u201d\n\n\u201cEfforts by the Russian government to secretly influence U.S. elections will not be tolerated,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cAs today\u2019s announcement demonstrates, the Criminal Division is committed to eradicating foreign malign influence from the U.S. political system and helping ensure the integrity of our elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement paints a harrowing picture of Russian government actions and the lengths to which the FSB will go to interfere with our elections, sow discord in our nation and ultimately recruit U.S citizens to their efforts,\u201d said Acting Assistant Director Kurt Ronnow of the FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Division. \u201cAll Americans should be deeply concerned by the tactics employed by the FSB and remain vigilant to any attempt to undermine our democracy. The FBI remains committed to confronting this egregious behavior and ultimately disrupting our adversaries and those who act on their behalf.\u201d\n\nUnited States v. Ionov, et al.\n\nAccording to the superseding indictment returned in the Middle District of Florida, Aleksandr Viktorovich Ionov, a resident of Moscow, was the founder and president of the Anti-Globalization Movement of Russia (AGMR), an organization headquartered in Moscow, Russia, and funded by the Russian government. Ionov allegedly utilized AGMR to carry out Russia\u2019s malign influence campaign. Ionov\u2019s influence efforts were allegedly directed and supervised by Moscow-based FSB officers, including indicted defendants Aleksey Borisovich Sukhodolov and Yegor Sergeyevich Popov.\n\n\u201cThe prosecution of this criminal conduct is essential to protecting the American public when foreign governments seek to inject themselves into the American political process,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Roger B. Handberg for the Middle District of Florida. \u201cWe thank our partners at the FBI for their tireless investigation of these events and their commitment to ensure justice is done.\u201d\n\nAmong other illegal activities, the superseding indictment alleges that Ionov, Sukhodolov and Popov conspired to directly and substantially influence democratic elections in the United States by clandestinely funding and directing the political campaign of a particular candidate for local office in St. Petersburg, Florida, in 2019. For instance, the superseding indictment alleges that Popov expressly referred to this effort on behalf of the FSB as \u201cour election campaign,\u201d and Ionov referring to the candidate as the \u201ccandidate whom we supervise.\u201d Ionov and Popov allegedly intended that this election interference plot would extend beyond the 2019 local election cycle in St. Petersburg, and subsequently discussed that the \u201cUSA Presidential election\u201d was the FSB\u2019s \u201cmain topic of the year.\u201d\n\nMoreover, from at least November 2014 until July 2022, Ionov allegedly engaged in a years-long foreign malign influence campaign targeting the United States. As a part of the campaign, Ionov allegedly recruited members of political groups within the United States, including the African People\u2019s Socialist Party and the Uhuru Movement (collectively, the APSP) in Florida, Black Hammer in Georgia and a political group in California (referred to in the superseding indictment as U.S. Political Group 3), to participate in the influence campaign and act as agents of Russia in the United States, including the following indicted defendants:\n\nOne focus of Ionov\u2019s alleged influence operation was to create the appearance of American popular support for Russia\u2019s annexation of territories in Ukraine. For example, in May 2020, Ionov allegedly sent a request he stated was from \u201cRussia, the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic\u201d \u2013 an apparent reference to a Russian-occupied region in eastern Ukraine \u2013 to Yeshitela and members of other U.S. political groups to make statements in support of the independence of the so-called Donetsk People\u2019s Republic, a Russian-backed breakaway state in eastern Ukraine. Ionov later allegedly touted to the FSB that Yeshitela\u2019s video-recorded statement of support was the first time that \u201cAmerican nonprofit organizations congratulated citizens\u201d of the occupied region.\n\nIonov\u2019s use of the APSP to promote Russian propaganda relating to Ukraine allegedly continued after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. On the day Russia invaded Ukraine, Feb. 24, 2022, Ionov allegedly emailed Nevel an \u201cURGENT MESSAGE\u201d which contained pro-Russian talking points in support of the invasion. Thereafter, throughout March 2022, the APSP repeatedly hosted Ionov via video conference to discuss the war, during which Ionov falsely stated that anyone who supported Ukraine also supported Naziism and white supremacy, and Yeshitela and another APSP member allegedly made statements of solidarity with the Russian government.\n\nIonov, Sukhodolov, Popov, Yeshitela, Hess, Nevel and Romain are charged with conspiring to have U.S. citizens act as illegal agents of the Russian government within the United States without providing prior notification to the Attorney General, as required by law. If convicted, they each face a maximum penalty of five years in prison. Yeshitela, Hess and Nevel are also charged with acting as agents of Russia within the United States without such prior notification. If convicted, they each face a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. If convicted, a federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorneys Daniel J. Marcet and Risha Asokan for the Middle District of Florida, Trial Attorney Menno Goedman of the Justice Department\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section, and Trial Attorney Demetrius Sumner of the Criminal Division\u2019s Public Integrity Section are prosecuting the case.\n\nUnited States v. Burlinova\n\nAccording to the affidavit in support of the criminal complaint unsealed in the District of Columbia, Russian national Natalia Burlinova, a resident of Moscow, conspired with an FSB officer to recruit U.S. citizens from academic and research institutions to travel to Russia to participate in a public diplomacy program called Meeting Russia. The program was operated by PICREADI, a Russian organization led by Burlinova, funded by the Russian government and devoted to promoting Russian national interests.\n\n\u201cThe defendant is accused of subverting our foreign agent notification laws to promote Russian national interests here in the United States, concealing from the public that her recruitment efforts were funded by a Russian security service,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves for the District of Columbia. \u201cWe will continue to expose these serious crimes and hold all who perpetrate them accountable.\u201d\n\nThe affidavit alleges that the FSB officer provided funding and other support for Burlinova\u2019s foreign recruitment and her efforts to advance Russian interests in the United States. In return, Burlinova provided the FSB officer with extensive information about U.S. citizens who were recruited to attend her programs, including their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, passport information, photographs and analyses of their views toward Russia. Burlinova further identified for the FSB officer particular U.S. citizens who, in Burlinova\u2019s view, had expressed positive attitudes towards Russia and were prepared to continue to collaborate. During a recruitment trip to the United States in fall 2018, Burlinova met with U.S. citizens at various universities and research institutions and provided to photographs of her meetings to the FSB officer. The FSB officer used the information Burlinova provided prepare FSB intelligence reports. Burlinova never notified the Attorney General of these efforts or otherwise disclosed to the public that her recruitment efforts were supported and funded by a Russian security service.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Michael J. Friedman for the District of Columbia and Trial Attorney Emma D. Ellenrieder of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting the case.\n\nAn indictment and a complaint are merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.",

            "article_text": "A massive case of organized tax and bank fraud culminated today with the unsealing of four federal grand jury indictments accusing 55 people of participating in one or more illicit schemes, including the theft of more than 2,000 identities that were used to claim more than $20 million in bogus IRS tax refunds. As a result the IRS paid out more than $7 million \u2013 even issuing payments in the names of dead people.\n\nThe charges are the result of a two year-long investigation by federal and local authorities in San Diego and Los Angeles. Twenty-two defendants were arrested this morning during sweeps in Los Angeles, San Diego, Las Vegas and Maryland. Hundreds of federal, state, and local law enforcement officers participated in the takedown. Thirty-three defendants remain at large, including 21 who are believed to be out of the country. During searches at 12 locations, authorities seized $13,000 in cash and four handguns, including three that were unregistered.\n\n\u201cThis case is staggering in terms of the number of victims, its level of sophistication, its audacious methods and the callous disregard for victims,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Laura Duffy. \u201cThese arrests are the first strike back on behalf of taxpayers and more than 2,000 victims who now have to reclaim their good names \u2013 a frustrating task that can take years. We will continue to make these cases a priority.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndividuals who commit refund fraud and identity theft of this magnitude and with this degree of dishonesty and deceit, deserve to be punished to the fullest extent of the law,\u201d said Richard Weber, Chief, IRS Criminal Investigation. \u201cIRS Criminal Investigation, along with our law enforcement partners and the United States Attorney's Office, remain vigilant in identifying, investigating and prosecuting individuals involved in these schemes.\u201d\n\nFBI Special Agent in Charge, Daphne Hearn, commented, \u201cThis investigation involved multiple complex fraudulent schemes resulting in significant losses to financial institutions and American taxpayers. Today's arrests...send a clear message to those involved in stealing money from American taxpayers. The FBI and our partners will aggressively pursue those involved in stealing precious taxpayer money through fraudulent schemes.\u201d\n\nTax refund fraud involving the use of stolen identities has emerged as such a fast-growing crime category that it has earned an acronym \u2013 SIRF \u2013 for Stolen Identity Refund Fraud. The Department of Justice issued a new directive last year to coordinate, expedite and streamline the prosecutorial efforts of the Tax Division and U.S. Attorneys offices nationwide.\n\nThe various schemes are described in four separate indictments:\n\n- The largest indictment \u2013 involving the identity theft and bogus tax refunds - charges 29 people and involved the alleged filing of about 2,000 fraudulent tax returns. The coconspirators filed two types of fraudulent returns \u2013 those that claimed refunds from fabricated gambling winnings and losses, and those based on made-up wages and withholdings. The returns sought $17 million in undeserved refunds.\n\nThis scheme involved the participation of scores of San Diego-based foreign nationals from former Soviet bloc countries - including Russia, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan - who were visiting San Diego using J-1 and F-1 visas. The visas allow foreigners to come to the United States for a short period of time to study, work, and travel.\n\nHowever, instead of studying or working, the almost two dozen foreign nationals charged today allegedly worked primarily as foot soldiers for criminal organizations operating in Los Angeles and elsewhere. Leaders of the identity theft ring, many of whom are Armenian nationals or Armenian-American, exploited the popular student visa program in part because the visa holders would not be here long. In fact, many have since returned to their countries.\n\nThe alleged leaders of the stolen identity fraud schemes were Arthur Grigorian, Ernest Soloian and Hovhannes Harutyunyan. One of the defendants, Yvonne Mihailescu, used her position as an of Wells Fargo Bank to open bank accounts which were used to receive the fraudulent tax refunds launder the proceeds, according to the indictment.\n\nWhile here, they rented apartments in San Diego and elsewhere, opened post office boxes and bank accounts at the San Diego branches of Bank of America and Wells Fargo, and collected fraudulent tax refunds through the receipt of refund checks and direct deposits from the U.S. Treasury. Some of the refund checks were mailed to apartments on University Avenue and El Cajon Boulevard in San Diego.\n\nThe indictment indicates that the coconspirators employed sophisticated methods to cover their tracks. For instance, they took steps to disguise their Internet Protocol (IP address) when filing tax returns electronically, making it difficult for law enforcement to determine the location. In addition, they used code language when communicating and referred to each other only by nicknames, such as \u201cAnaconda\u201d and \u201cBlondie.\u201d They used prepaid cell phones which they changed on a regular basis.\n\n- A second indictment charges three people who are accused of filing more than 400 false returns using stolen identities which claimed more than $3 million in fraudulent refunds. Armen Eritsian and Hovhannes Harutyunyan are the alleged leaders of the scheme.\n\n- A third indictment charges eight people, led by Hovakim Sogomonian and Harout Gevorgyan, and describes an elaborate ruse in which defendants obtained bank account and other personal information about wealthy Wells Fargo customers and then sent imposters to branches to withdraw large sums of money. The imposters altered their appearances with haircuts and new clothes and prepared by role-playing. In all they attempted to withdraw more than $3 million, and succeeded in obtaining $551,842, the indictment said. The imposters instructed tellers to wire large sums of money to the account of a gold dealer, and then they picked up gold coins from the dealer and delivered them to the other defendants.\n\n- Finally, a fourth indictment charges 18 defendants, led by Karen Galstian and Vahag Stepanyan, with a scheme to defraud Bank of America of more than $600,000 by writing bad checks. This scheme also utilized stolen identities to further the fraud.\n\nThe FBI and IRS recommend that individuals take the following steps to minimize the chance of becoming a victim of identity theft:\n\n\uf0b7 Don\u2019t carry your Social Security card or any document with your SSN on it.\uf0b7 Don\u2019t give a business your SSN just because they ask. Give it only when required.\uf0b7 Protect your financial information.\uf0b7 Check your credit report every 12 months.\uf0b7 Secure personal information in your home.\uf0b7 Protect your personal computers by using firewalls, anti-spam/virus software, update security patches, and change passwords for Internet accounts.\uf0b7 Don\u2019t give personal information over the phone, through the mail or on the Internet unless you have initiated the contact or you are sure you know who you are dealing with.\n\nAll of the defendants arrested in today\u2019s operation are expected to make their initial appearances in federal court either today or tomorrow in the district where they were arrested. Following the defendants\u2019 initial appearances, the next scheduled court date is Oct. 3, 2013, at 2 p.m., before United States Magistrate Judge Mitchell D. Dembin.\n\n*U.S. Attorney Duffy, the IRS\u2019 Anthony J. Orlando and the FBI\u2019s Darrell Foxworth will be available for interviews this afternoon.

            "article_text": "Greenbelt, Maryland - A federal jury has convicted Nader Modanlo, a/k/a Nader Modanlou, a/k/a Nader Modanlu, age 52, of Potomac, Maryland, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Iran, of charges arising from a conspiracy to illegally provide satellite related services to Iran in violation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, money laundering and obstruction of bankruptcy proceedings. As a result of the conspiracy, an Iranian earth observation satellite equipped with a camera was launched into space from Russia on October 27, 2005. The launch was the first-ever Iranian satellite put into orbit.\n\nThe jury verdict was announced by United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein; Special Agent in Charge William Winter of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI); Special Agent in Charge Thomas J. Kelly of the Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigation, Washington, D.C. Field Office; and Special Agent in Charge Robert Craig of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, Mid-Atlantic Field Office.\n\n\u201cNader Modanlo violated the law by helping Iran launch communications satellites,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Rod J. Rosenstein. \u201cThe Iran Trade Embargo prohibits Americans from supplying goods, technology and services to Iran directly or indirectly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis conviction is the result of a complex, decade long HSI investigation that spanned multiple countries and involved close partnership with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Maryland, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service and the Internal Revenue Service,\u201d said HSI Special Agent in Charge in Baltimore William Winter. \u201cThis investigation shows that HSI special agents will tenaciously pursue those who attempt to illegally export sensitive technologies and threaten the security of the United States by willfully violating our customs laws.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS), the criminal investigative arm of the Office of the Inspector General, Department of Defense, is committed to pursuing cases involving the illegal transfer of critical U.S. Defense Department-related technologies throughout the world,\u201d said Robert E. Craig, Jr., Special Agent in Charge of the DCIS Mid-Atlantic Field Office. \u201cAlong with our law enforcement partners and as demonstrated in this case, DCIS is diligently pursuing individuals and companies that willingly break the law and unnecessarily place the safety of America's warfighters and all Americans at risk.\u201d\n\n\u201cIRS Criminal Investigation is committed to following the money trail across the globe and will not be deterred by the use of front companies and sophisticated financial transactions that hide the real ownership of the proceeds of criminal activity,\u201d said Thomas J. Kelly, Special Agent in Charge, IRS Criminal Investigation, Washington DC Field Office. \u201cToday\u2019s verdict is a reminder that IRS Criminal Investigation along with our domestic and international law enforcement partners will continue our vigilant pursuit of criminal conspiracies.\u201d\n\nThe President of the United States issued an Executive Order in 1995 imposing a trade embargo against Iran, after finding that Iran\u2019s policies and actions posed a threat to the national security of the United States. Under the embargo, the Department of the Treasury, through the Office of Foreign Assets Control, issued the Iranian Transactions Regulations, which prohibited the export, re-export, sale or supply, directly or indirectly, by a U.S. citizen, of goods, technology or services to Iran or the Government of Iran, without prior governmental authorization.\n\nAccording to evidence presented at the six week trial, Modanlo was a mechanical engineer who received science and engineering degrees from George Washington University. Modanlo represented that he was an internationally-recognized expert on strategic policy and finances affecting the space-based telecommunications industry, and that he managed space and science programs for the Department of Defense, NASA and the industry.\n\nTrial evidence showed that from January 2000 through November 27, 2007, Modanlo and others concocted a scheme to evade the Iran trade embargo to conceal Iranian involvement in prohibited activities and transactions. Beginning in 1992, Modanlo was the principal owner, chairman and president of Final Analysis, Inc. (FAI) in Maryland. Beginning in 1994, FAI contracted with POLYOT, an aerospace enterprise company owned by the government of the Russian Federation, to launch FAI telecommunications satellites. Between 1995 through 2000, FAI and POLYOT launched a satellite purchased by FAI, and designed, constructed and launched a second satellite, both from Plesetsk, Russia. Modanlo and other FAI personnel met with POLYOT officials as part of that relationship. As required by law, Modanlo obtained U.S. export licenses in order to export and launch the telecommunications satellites and other equipment from Russia.\n\nIn November 2001, Modanlo established New York Satellite Industries, LLC, (NYSI) after creditors filed a petition to place FAI into involuntary bankruptcy. NYSI purchased FAI\u2019s assets and Modanlo served as chairman and managing member of NYSI, using his home address as NYSI\u2019s business address.\n\nBeginning in 2000, Modanlo brokered an agreement between POLYOT and Iran to construct and launch a satellite. Between the summer of 2001 and December 2001, Modanlo engaged in numerous meetings with POLYOT officials to broker Iran\u2019s satellite program. In December 2001, several Iranian officials, including Sirous Naseri, a former Iranian Amabassador to Switzerland, went to Switzerland to express interest in \u201cinvesting\u201d in NYSI by interposing a Swiss company, because \u201cthe U.S. ha[d] sanctions in place against Iran,\u201d and direct investment would therefore be \u201cproblematic.\u201d Naseri, Reza Heidari, Mohammad Modares and Modanlo then went to Switzerland in April 2002 to work out the details of forming Prospect Telecom in order to conceal Iranian participation as an investor/lender in Modanlo\u2019s satellite telecommunications activities. Between April and June 2002, Heidari, Mohammad Modares and Abdol Mehrdad established Prospect Telecom and opened a bank account in Switzerland in the name of Prospect Telecom.\n\nHeidari, Modares, and Mehrdad then caused $10 million to be wired from Prospect Telecom\u2019s bank account overseas to Modanlo\u2019s NYSI account in Bowie, Maryland, in consideration for Modanlo\u2019s assistance to Iran and the Iranians in brokering the satellite agreement with Russia, and for NYSI providing telecommunications services in support of that agreement. Modanlo had agreed that NYSI would assist in obtaining telecommunications service provider licenses for the owners of Prospect Telecom and for the benefit of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\nIn October 2005, as a result of the efforts of Modanlo and his conspirators, POLYOT launched Iran\u2019s first-ever satellite, a remote sensing and telecommunications satellite from Russia.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2007, Modanlo made false statements and concealed information about the creation and ownership of Prospect Telecom during bankruptcy proceedings, including that Modanlo and co-conspirators had arranged for the formation of Prospect telecom to conceal Iranian involvement.\n\nModanlo faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison for the conspiracy; 10 years in prison on each of two counts of violating the Iran Trade Embargo, 20 years on money laundering related to the transfer of the $10 million from Switzerland to the defendant\u2019s NYSI bank account, 10 years for each of five subsequent money-laundering transactions, which disbursed most of the $10 million; and 20 years in prison for obstruction of a bankruptcy proceeding. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on one count of violating the Iran Trade Embargo. U.S. District Judge Peter J. Messitte scheduled sentencing for September 11, 2013. The government also seeks the forfeiture of $10 million, which is the proceeds of the offense.\n\nThe other defendants charged in the indictment, Hamid Malmirian, age 53; Reza Heidari, age 52; Mohammad Modares, age 44; Abdol Reza Mehrdad, age 43; and Sirous Naseri, age 55, all Iranian nationals, remain at large.\n\nUnited States Attorney Rod J. Rosenstein praised the HSI Baltimore, DCIS and IRS - Criminal Investigation for their work in the investigation. Mr. Rosenstein thanked Assistant United States Attorneys David I. Salem and Stuart Berman, who are prosecuting the case.",

            "article_text": "Deputy Attorney General (Deputy AG) Lisa Monaco traveled to Brussels last week to lead the U.S. delegation at the U.S.-EU Justice and Home Affairs Ministerial and reaffirm the Justice Department\u2019s commitment to a critical alliance that combats shared risks to global security.\n\nThe Ministerial brings together leadership from the Justice and Home Affairs Ministries of the European Union and the U.S. Departments of Justice and Homeland Security to strengthen transatlantic collaboration. The Ministers focused on addressing persistent threats to our nations, including organized crime, terrorism, cybercrime, and foreign malign influence \u2014 especially by nation-states seeking to sow discord and further their autocratic agendas amid this year\u2019s global elections, when over four billion people are expected to vote. They also discussed international law enforcement collaboration to disrupt trafficking of cocaine and synthetic drugs, particularly fentanyl, as well as AI \u2014 including AI\u2019s potential to enhance law enforcement operations and the risk that it could supercharge criminal activity.\n\nDuring the Ministerial, the officials reaffirmed their resolute support for Ukraine and unwavering resolve to hold Russia accountable for war crimes, atrocities, and the crime of aggression. They reiterated the need for sustained coordination between the U.S. and EU to deprive the Russian war machine of funding and supplies \u2014 with the Deputy AG underscoring the successful efforts of the Department\u2019sDisruptive Technology Strike ForceandTask Force KleptoCaptureto enforce export controls and the sweeping sanctions imposed on Russia for its unprovoked aggression against Ukraine. The officials also emphasized their commitment to supporting anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine.\n\nWhile in Brussels, the Deputy AG convened an\u00a0international meeting of the Justice Department\u2019sJustice AIInitiative with Member of the European Parliament (MEP) Eva Maydell and leaders from the European Parliament, which recently passed the EU AI Act\u2014the first comprehensive legislative framework to govern the integration of AI into society.Launchedby Deputy AG Monaco earlier this year, Justice AI brings together stakeholders across civil society, industry, academia, and government to share expertise and a wide range of perspectives on both the promise of AI and the perils of its misuse.\n\nThe Deputy AG and MEPs discussed how AI is changing the way crimes are committed in the United States and in Europe \u2014 from intensifying cyberattacks, to making fraud scams more believable, to creating child sexual abuse material. They also focused on the threat of malign state actors using AI to undermine global elections this year, and the MEPs shared observations and lessons learned from recent European elections. The Deputy AG underscored that the Justice Department will remain vigilant to foreign adversaries abusing AI to accelerate online hate and disinformation, imitate trusted sources of information, and proliferate deepfakes.\n\nDuring her trip,\u00a0the Deputy AG also held bilateral meetings with European Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson and Belgian Minister of Justice Paul Van Tigchelt to highlight areas for continued collaboration between the Justice Department and our European partners. She met with United States Ambassador to the European Union Mark Gitenstein and United States Ambassador to Belgium Michael Adler, and also visited the U.S. Mission to the European Union and the U.S. Embassy in Belgium for a briefing with U.S. officials on their work with our European allies and to thank them for their service.",

Wood.\n\nAccording to the charging and sentencing documents, and statements made in Manhattan federal court:\n\nIn approximately 2007, computer network security experts identified, for the first time, a form of malicious software, or malware, that was stealing victims\u2019 personal bank account information on a widespread basis.\u00a0 The malware, which the experts named \u201cGozi\u201d (and which is sometimes called the \u201cGozi Virus\u201d) infected the victim\u2019s computer, among other ways, when the victim received and opened a .pdf document that was designed to appear innocuous and relevant to the victim.\u00a0 Opening the .pdf caused Gozi to be downloaded onto the victim\u2019s computer secretly, where it generally remained undetectable by anti-virus software.\u00a0 Once downloaded, the malware collected bank account-related data from the victim\u2019s computer, including the username and password, to access the victim\u2019s bank account online.\u00a0 The malware transmitted that data to the individuals who controlled the malware, which they used fraudulently to transfer money out of victims\u2019 bank accounts.\u00a0\u00a0 The network security experts subsequently identified a server that contained certain data stolen by Gozi, including 10,000 account records belonging to over 5,200 personal computer users.\u00a0 The records included login information for accounts at over 300 companies, including leading global banks and financial services firms.\n\nCoordinated efforts between U.S. and foreign law enforcement ultimately led to the identification of KUZMIN, a Russian national, as the individual who controlled the malware.\u00a0 KUZMIN previously had significant computer science training, attending two major engineering universities in Russia and graduating with a computer science degree.\n\nIn addition to creating Gozi, KUZMIN developed an innovative means of distributing and profiting from it.\u00a0 Unlike many cybercriminals at the time, who profited from malware solely by using it to steal money, KUZMIN rented out Gozi to other criminals, pioneering the model of cybercriminals as service providers for other criminals.\u00a0 For a fee of $500 a week paid in WebMoney, a digital currency widely used by cybercriminals, KUZMIN rented the Gozi \u201cexecutable,\u201d the file that could be used to infect victims with Gozi malware, to other criminals.\u00a0\u00a0 KUZMIN designed Gozi to work with customized \u201cweb injects\u201d created by other criminals that could be used to enable the malware to target information from specific banks; for example, criminals who sought to target customers of particular American banks could purchase web injects that caused the malware to search for and steal information associated with those banks.\u00a0\u00a0 Once KUZMIN\u2019s customers succeeded in infecting victims\u2019 computers with Gozi, the malware caused victims\u2019 bank account information to be sent to a server that KUZMIN controlled where, as long as the criminals had paid their weekly rental fee, KUZMIN gave them access to it.\u00a0 KUZMIN, who used the online identity \u201c76,\u201d advertised this cybercriminal business, which he called \u201c76 Service,\u201d on underground cybercriminal forums. \u00a0KUZMIN made at least a quarter of a million dollars renting and selling Gozi to other criminals.\n\nIn the course of the investigation, Gozi was found to have infected over one million computers across the United States, Germany, Great Britain, Poland, France, Finland, Italy, Turkey, and other countries.\u00a0 U.S. victims include individuals, companies, and others, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (\u201cNASA\u201d).\u00a0 Gozi caused at least tens of millions of dollars in losses to victims.\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\n\nIn addition to the sentence, KUZMIN, 28, a citizen of Russia, was ordered to pay forfeiture and restitution in the amount of $6,934,979.\n\nOn January 5, 2016, Deniss Calovskis, a/k/a \u201cMiami,\u201d a Latvian national who wrote the computer code for certain \u201cweb injects\u201d that enabled Gozi to target information from particular banks, was sentenced to time served (21 months) for his role in the offense. \u00a0Mihai Ionut Paunescu, a/k/a \u201cVirus,\u201d a Romanian national who allegedly ran a \u201cbulletproof hosting\u201d service that enabled cybercriminals to distribute Gozi and other notorious malware, was arrested in Romania in December 2012 and currently awaits extradition to the United States.\n\nMr. Bharara praised the Federal Bureau of Investigation for its outstanding work in the investigation.\u00a0 He also specially thanked the NASA Office of Inspector General.\n\nThe case is being handled by the Office\u2019s Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit.\u00a0 Assistant United States Attorneys Nicole Friedlander and Sarah Lai are in charge of the prosecution.",

            "article_text": "Eric Holder, the Attorney General of the United States, Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, John S. Carlin, Assistant Attorney General for National Security, and Randall C. Coleman, the Assistant Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d) for the Counterintelligence Division, announced charges today against EVGENY BURYAKOV, a/k/a \u201cZhenya,\u201d IGOR SPORYSHEV, and VICTOR PODOBNYY in connection with BURYAKOV\u2019s service as a covert intelligence agent on behalf of the Russian Federation (\u201cRussia\u201d) in New York City, without notifying the United States Attorney General of BURYAKOV\u2019s status as an agent of Russia, as required by federal law. BURYAKOV was placed under arrest earlier today in Bronx, New York, and is scheduled to appear before U.S. Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn in Manhattan federal court later today. SPORYSHEV and PODOBNYY no longer reside in the United States and have not been arrested. By virtue of their prior positions in the United States on behalf of Russia, both of them were protected by diplomatic immunity from arrest and prosecution while in the United States.\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder said: \u201cThese charges demonstrate our firm commitment to combating attempts by covert agents to illegally gather intelligence and recruit spies within the United States. We will use every tool at our disposal to identify and hold accountable foreign agents operating inside this country \u2013 no matter how deep their cover. I want to thank the dedicated men and women of the FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Division and New York Field Office, the National Security Division\u2019s Counterespionage Section, and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York for their skilled handling of this complex and highly sensitive matter.\u201d\n\nU.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said: \u201cFollowing our previous prosecution with the FBI of Russian spies, who were expelled from the United States in 2010 when their plan to infiltrate upper levels of U.S. business and government was revealed, the arrest of Evgeny Buryakov and the charges against him and his co-defendants make clear that \u2013 more than two decades after the presumptive end of the Cold War \u2013 Russian spies continue to seek to operate in our midst under cover of secrecy. Indeed, the presence of a Russian banker in New York would in itself hardly draw attention today, which is why these alleged spies may have thought Buryakov would blend in. What they could not do without drawing the attention of the FBI was engage in espionage. New York City may be more hospitable to Russian businessmen than during the Cold War, but my Office and the FBI remain vigilant to the illegal intelligence-gathering activities of other nations.\u201d\n\nAssistant Attorney General John P. Carlin said: \u201cThe attempt by foreign nations to illegally gather economic and other intelligence information in the United States through covert agents is a direct threat to the national security of the United States, and it exemplifies why counterespionage is a top priority of the National Security Division. I want to thank the FBI\u2019s New York Field Office and Counterintelligence Division as well as the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York for their continued effort to conduct these highly complex and sensitive counterespionage investigations and prosecutions, and for their continued close partnership with the National Security Division and the Counterespionage Section.\u201d\n\nFBI Assistant Director Randall Coleman said: \u201cThis investigation is one of many that highlight the determined and prolific efforts by foreign governments to target Americans for the purposes of collecting intelligence and stealing secrets. This case is especially egregious as it demonstrates the actions of a foreign intelligence service to integrate a covert intelligence agent into American society under the cover of an employee in the financial sector. Espionage is as pervasivetoday as it has even been, and FBI counterintelligence teams will continue to aggressively investigate and expose hostile foreign intelligence activities conducted on U.S. soil.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Complaint unsealed in Manhattan federal court today:\n\nBURYAKOV worked in the United States as an agent of Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence agency, known as the \u201cSVR.\u201d BURYAKOV operated under \u201cnon-official cover,\u201d meaning he entered and remained in the United States as a private citizen, posing as an employee in the Manhattan office of a Russian bank. SVR agents operating under such non-official cover \u2013 sometimes referred to as \u201cNOCs\u201d \u2013 typically are subject to less scrutiny by the host government, and, in many cases, are never identified as intelligence agents by the host government. As a result, a NOC is an extremely valuable intelligence asset for the SVR.\n\nFederal law prohibits individuals from acting as agents of foreign governments within the United States without prior notification to the United States Attorney General. Department of Justice records indicate that BURYAKOV has never notified the United States Attorney General that he is, in fact, an agent of Russia.\n\nSPORYSHEV and PODOBNYY are also SVR agents who worked in the United States to gather intelligence on behalf of Russia by posing as official representatives of Russia. From November 22, 2010, to November 21, 2014, SPORYSHEV served as a Trade Representative of the Russian Federation in New York. From December 13, 2012, to September 12, 2013, PODOBNYY served as an Attach\u00e9 to the Permanent Mission of the Russian Federation to the United Nations. Based on their official government postings on behalf of Russia, SPORYSHEV and PODOBNYY are exempt from notifying the United States Attorney General of the true nature of their work. However, that exemption does not permit them to conspire with, or aid and abet, BURYAKOV in his work as an unregistered agent of Russia operating within the United States.\n\nThe intelligence-gathering efforts of SPORYSHEV and PODOBNYY included, among other things, (i) attempting to recruit New York City residents as intelligence sources for Russia; (ii) tasking BURYAKOV to gather intelligence; and (iii) transmitting intelligence reports prepared by BURYAKOV back to SVR headquarters in Moscow. Specifically, during the course of the charged offenses, SPORYSHEV was responsible for relaying assignments from the SVR to BURYAKOV, and SPORYSHEV and PODOBNYY were responsible for analyzing and reporting back to the SVR about the fruits of BURYAKOV\u2019s intelligence-gathering efforts.\n\nThe directives from the SVR to BURYAKOV, SPORYSHEV, and PODOBNYY, as well as to other covert SVR agents acting within the United States, included requests to gather intelligence on, among other subjects, potential United States sanctions against Russian banks and the United States\u2019 efforts to develop alternative energy resources.\n\nDuring the course of their work as covert SVR agents in the United States, BURYAKOV, SPORYSHEV, and PODOBNYY regularly met and communicated using clandestine methods and coded messages, in order to exchange intelligence-related information while shielding their associations with one another as SVR agents. These efforts were designed, among other things, to preserve their respective covers as an employee of a bank in Manhattan (BURYAKOV), a Trade Representative of the Russian Federation in New York (SPORYSHEV), and an Attach\u00e9 to the Permanent Mission of the Russian Federation to the United Nations (PODOBNYY). In particular, the defendants worked to safeguard BURYAKOV\u2019s work as a \u201cNOC.\u201d\n\nSPORYSHEV and PODOBNYY acted as covert intermediaries for BURYAKOV to communicate with the SVR on intelligence-related matters. As an agent posing as someone without any official ties to the Russian government or the SVR, BURYAKOV was unable to access the SVR New York Office \u2013 which is located within an office maintained by Russia in New York, New York \u2013 without potentially alerting others to his association with the SVR. As such, BURYAKOV required the assistance of other SVR agents, like SPORYSHEV and PODOBNYY, to exchange communications and information with the SVR through the communications systems located in the SVR New York Office.\n\nFrom as early as March 2012 through as recently as mid-September 2014, the FBI has conducted physical or electronic surveillance of BURYAKOV and SPORYSHEV engaging in over four dozen brief meetings, several of which involved BURYAKOV passing a bag, magazine, or slip of paper to SPORYSHEV. These meetings typically took place outdoors, where the risk of effective surveillance was reduced relative to an indoor location.\n\nThese meetings were nearly always preceded by a short telephone call between BURYAKOV and SPORYSHEV during which one of the men typically told the other that he had an item to give to him. Typically, during these telephone calls, which were intercepted by the FBI, the item in question was referred to as some non-specific \u201cticket,\u201d \u201cbook,\u201d \u201clist,\u201d or other ordinary item (e.g., \u201cumbrella\u201d or \u201chat\u201d).\n\nSubsequently, at each meeting surveilled by the FBI, BURYAKOV and SPORYSHEV met and sometimes exchanged documents or other small items. Notably, despite discussing on approximately one dozen occasions the need to meet to transfer \u201ctickets,\u201d BURYAKOV and SPORYSHEV, were \u2013 other than one occasion where they discussed going to a movie \u2013 never observed attending, or discussing in any detail, events that would typically require tickets, such as a sporting event or concert. In fact, BURYAKOV and SPORYSHEV used this coded language to signal that they needed to meet, and then met to exchange intelligence information.\n\nIn numerous recorded communications, SPORYSHEV and PODOBNYY discussed their attempts to recruit United States residents, including several individuals employed by major companies, and several young women with ties to a major university located in New York, New York (\u201cUniversity-1\u201d), as intelligence sources for the SVR. On these recordings, the defendants discussed the potential value of these sources, and identified particular sources by use of a \u201csource name,\u201d which appears to be a coded name. In addition, during these recordings, SPORYSHEV and PODOBNYY discussed the efforts of other SVR agents to recruit a number of other Russian-origin individuals associated with University-1 as intelligence sources.\n\nFor example, SPORYSHEV and PODOBNYY discussed PODOBNYY\u2019s efforts to recruit a male working as a consultant in New York City as an intelligence source. During this conversation, PODOBNYY explained his source recruitment method, which included cheating, promising favors, and then discarding the intelligence source once the relevant information was obtained by the SVR: \u201cThis is intelligence method to cheat. . . . You promise a favor for a favor. You get the documents from him and tell him to go [expletive] himself.\u201d\n\nIn other recorded conversations, SPORYSHEV and PODOBNYY made clear that they worked for the SVR. For example, on January 31, 2013, SPORYSHEV and another SVR agent not charged in the Complaint (\u201cCC-1\u201d) had a discussion inside the SVR New York Office about their contracts with the SVR. SPORYSHEV stated that, \u201cEveryone has a five-year contract,\u201d and explained, in response to CC-1\u2019s question about reimbursement for the travel of SVR agents\u2019 family members, that \u201ctravel for military personnel and their families on authorized home leave is paid, and in our, in our SVR, this, the payment for getting to and from the duty station.\u201d In addition, on April 25, 2013, SPORYSHEV and PODOBNYY discussed the use of nontraditional cover for Russian intelligence officers and, in particular, the Illegals program that ended with the arrest of 10 \u201cdeep cover\u201d SVR agents in July 2010.\n\nSPORYSHEV was responsible for relaying intelligence assignments from the SVR to BURYAKOV. The FBI obtained electronic recordings of several conversations relating to such intelligence directives being communicated to and carried out by BURYAKOV in his position as an SVR agent acting under non-official cover. For example, on May 21, 2013, SPORYSHEV called BURYAKOV to ask for BURYAKOV\u2019s help in formulating questions to be used for intelligence gathering purposes by others associated with a leading Russian state-owned news organization (the \u201cNews Organization\u201d). BURYAKOV responded by supplying SPORYSHEV with a particular line of questioning about the New York Stock Exchange for use by the News Organization.\n\nIn the summer of 2014, BURYAKOV met numerous times with a confidential source working for the FBI (\u201cCS-1\u201d). CS-1 posed as the representative of a wealthy investor looking to develop casinos in Russia. During the course of these meetings, and consistent with his interests as a Russian intelligence agent, BURYAKOV demonstrated his strong desire to obtain information about subjects far outside the scope of his work as a bank employee. During these meetings, BURYAKOV also accepted documents that CS-1 claimed he had obtained from a U.S. government agency and which purportedly contained information potentially useful to Russia, including information about United States sanctions against Russia.\n\nBURYAKOV, 39, SPORYSHEV, 40, and PODOBNYY, 27, are charged in two counts. The first count charges the defendants with participating in a conspiracy for BURYAKOV to act in the United States as an agent of a foreign government without first notifying the Attorney General, and carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison. The second count charges BURYAKOV with acting in the United States as an agent of a foreign government without first notifying the Attorney General, and charges SPORYSHEV and PODOBYNYY with aiding and abetting that offense. The second count carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendants will be determined by a judge.\n\nMr. Bharara praised the investigative work of the FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Division.\n\nThe prosecution is being handled by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Adam Fee, Ian McGinley, and Anna M. Skotko of the Terrorism and International Narcotics Unit of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York, and Senior Trial Attorney Heather Schmidt of the Counterespionage Section of the Department of Justice\u2019s National Security Division.\n\nThe charges in the Complaint are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\n\nUS v.

            "article_text": "NEWARK, N.J. \u2013 A resident and citizen of Russia was indicted by a federal grand jury today for his alleged role in an international procurement network that smuggled over $65 million worth of electronics from the United States to Russia in violation of export control laws, U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito announced.\n\nAlexander Brazhnikov Sr., 72, of Moscow, is charged by indictment with one count each of conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to smuggle goods from the United States, and conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Brazhnikov Sr. is currently at large.\n\nAccording to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:\n\nBrazhnikov Sr. was the owner, chief executive officer, and principal operator of ABN Universal, a privately held Russian microelectronics import/export company in Moscow. His son, Alexander Brazhnikov Jr., 39, of Mountainside, owned and operated four New Jersey-based microelectronics export companies in Carteret, Mountainside, Union, and Manalapan.\n\nBrazhnikov Sr. and Brazhnikov Jr. participated in a sophisticated procurement network that secretly acquired large quantities of electronic components from U.S. manufacturers and vendors and exported those parts to Russia on behalf of Russian business entities authorized to supply those parts to the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) and Russian entities involved in the design of nuclear warheads and other weapons.\n\nAs part of the scheme, Brazhnikov Sr., through his Moscow business, obtained initial requests for quotes for the U.S.-based electronics components from various Russian entities and sent these requests directly to U.S.-based vendors electronically or to his son for implementation. Brazhnikov Sr., Brazhnikov Jr., and others then used Brazhnikov Jr.\u2019s New Jersey export companies to purchase the electronic components from the U.S.-based distributors and re-package them for shipment to Moscow.\n\nIn order to obscure the extent of the network\u2019s procurement activities and avoid filing the necessary export control forms, Brazhnikov Sr., Brazhnikov Jr., and others routinely falsified the true end-users and value of the components they exported. Each shipment from the United States was sent to one of 12 false addresses or shell locations in Moscow established at Brazhnikov Sr.\u2019s direction, re-directed to a central warehouse he and others controlled, and ultimately shipped to the end-users in Russia, including the Russian defense contracting firms.\n\nThe funds for these illicit transactions were obtained from various Russian purchasers and initially deposited into one of Brazhnikov Sr.\u2019s primary accounts in Russia. In order to further conceal the actual customers and the source of the funds, disbursements for purchases were then made through one or more foreign accounts held by shell corporations in the British Virgin Islands, Latvia, Marshall Islands, Panama, Ireland, England, United Arab Emirates, and Belize, and ultimately into one of Brazhnikov Jr.\u2019s U.S.-based accounts.\n\nThe money laundering conspiracy charge carries a maximum potential penalty of 20 years in prison and a $500,000 fine. The conspiracy to violate the IEEPA carries a maximum potential penalty of 20 years in prison. The charge of conspiracy to smuggle goods carries a potential penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.\n\nBrazhnikov Jr. previously pleaded guilty to his role in the scheme and was sentenced June 30, 2016, to 70 months in prison.\n\nU.S. Attorney Carpenito credited special agents of the FBI, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Gregory W. Ehrie in Newark; the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, Office of Export Enforcement, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Jonathan Carson in New York; and the Department of Homeland Security, Homeland Security Investigations, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Brian Michael in Newark, with the investigation leading to today\u2019s charges.\n\nThe government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney Dean C. Sovolos of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office National Security Unit in Newark, with assistance from Trial Attorney David Recker of the Department of Justice National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.\n\nThe charges and allegations contained in the indictment are merely accusations, and Brazhnikov Sr. is considered innocent unless and until proven guilty.",

            "article_text": "One year ago, on February 16, 2023, the Departments of Justice and Commerce, alongside their partners at the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Homeland Security Investigations,launchedthe Disruptive Technology Strike Force to fiercely protect advanced technology from being unlawfully acquired by foreign adversaries.\u00a0 Together, the agencies that comprise the Strike Force have taken an all-tools approach to aggressively pursue enforcement actions against illegal procurement networks and prevent nation-state actors from illicitly acquiring our most sensitive technology.\n\nIn the twelve months since its formation, the Strike Force has successfully:\n\nCharged 14 cases involving alleged sanctions and export control violations, smuggling conspiracies, and other offenses related to the unlawful transfer of sensitive information, goods, and military-grade technology to Russia, China, or Iran.\n\nThese cases were brought in partnership with Task Force KleptoCapture, an interagency law enforcement effort dedicated to enforcing the sweeping sanctions, export restrictions, and economic countermeasures that the United States, along with its allies and partners, has imposed in response to Russia\u2019s unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThree cases charged former employees of U.S. companies with stealing confidential and proprietary information related to sensitive technology and attempting to take such information to China, and one case charged a defendant with seeking to obtain technology from U.S. manufacturers on behalf of Chinese end users.\n\nIn February 2024, California resident Chenguang Gong wasarrestedfor transferring more than 3,600 files containing proprietary information from his employer, including files with blueprints for sophisticated missile-detection technology. According to the complaint, Gong sought funding from the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC)-administered \u201cTalent Programs,\u201d which recruit individuals overseas with expertise sought after by the PRC, to develop similar technology.\n\nIn May 2023, Liming Li of California wasarrestedfor his alleged theft of sensitive technology related to advanced manufacturing software programs from his Southern-California-based employers and using that information to market his own competing company to businesses in China.\n\nIn May 2023, California man and former Apple employee Weibao Wang waschargedin connection with a scheme to steal Apple source code and other proprietary information related to autonomous systems. Allegedly, he left Apple to work as an engineer for a U.S.-based subsidiary of a China-based company to work on the development of self-driving cars, and, following a search of his residence, Wang left the country for China.\n\nIn December 2023, Belgian national Hans Maria De Geetere waschargedand arrested in Belgium for crimes related to a years-long scheme to export accelerometers used in aerospace and military systems from the United States to end users in China.\n\nThree cases charged individuals with seeking to procure sensitive U.S. technology on behalf of the government of Iran or Iranian end users.\n\nIn February 2024, Iranian national Abolfazi Bazzazi and his son Mohammad Resa Bazzazi werechargedwith violating U.S. sanctions by procuring for the Government of Iran and other Iranian ends users goods and technology from U.S. companies that supply the military, aerospace, and firefighting industries.\n\nIn January 2023, four Chinese nationals, Baoxia Liu, You Wa Yung, Yongxin Li, and Yanlai Zhong, werechargedwith smuggling U.S.-origin items used in the production of UAVs and ballistic missile systems through Chinese front companies to Iranian entities with ties to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Ministry of Defense.\n\nIn May 2023, Chinese national Xiangjiang Qiao waschargedwith multiple offenses related to a scheme to use a sanctioned Chinese company to provide high-tech materials used in the production of weapons of mass destruction to Iran, in exchange for payments made through the U.S. financial system.\n\nSecured the guilty plea of a defendant charged for her role in a multimillion-dollar scheme to send electronic components used in UAVs and guided missile systems and other weapons to sanctioned entities in Russia.\n\nIn February 2024, Canadian national Kristina Puzyreva, one of three defendants charged in the case,pleaded guiltyto money laundering conspiracy as part of a sophisticated sanctions and export control scheme involving two Brooklyn-based companies.\n\nIssued Temporary Denial Orders against 29 entities, including airlines, freight forwarders, defense companies, and others to cut off their access to controlled U.S. items.\n\nContributed to numerous parties being placed on Commerce\u2019s Entity List and Treasury\u2019s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List.\n\nForged international partnerships committed to preventing critical technology from being siphoned off by foreign adversaries.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen and Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement Matthew Axelrodtraveled to Kyivin November 2023, following prior visits by the Attorney General to Ukraine, to reaffirm the Strike Force\u2019s close partnership with the Ukrainian Prosecutor General and commitment to curbing the illegal flow of advanced technology to Russia.\n\nFollowing the Camp David Leaders\u2019 Summit with President Biden and the leaders of Japan and Korea, DOJ and Commerce took steps to establish aDisruptive Technology Protection Networkwith South Korea and Japan to expand collaboration on technology protection measures, including expanding information-sharing and the exchange of best practices across the three countries\u2019 enforcement agencies.\n\nAs part of the Munich Security Conference, Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen and Assistant Secretary Matthew Axelrod participated in a panel discussion on safeguarding disruptive technology in a new era of economic statecraft.\n\nDuring aspeechin the United Kingdom, where she announced the creation of the Strike Force in February 2023, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco deliveredremarksabout the national security risks posed by artificial intelligence and why it is a top enforcement priority for the Strike Force.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen deliveredremarksand participated in a roundtable discussion hosted by the American Academy at the U.S. embassy in Berlin, Germany. \u00a0Throughout the visit, AAG Olsen reaffirmed the Department\u2019s close partnership with foreign counterparts to stop the flow of sensitive technology to foreign adversaries.\n\nAssistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Enforcement Matthew Axelroddelivered remarkson international partnerships, with a focus on the Strike Force, at the Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control-Bureau of Industry and Security Export Control Forum in Frankfurt, Germany.\n\n\n\nFostered partnerships with the private sector, working directly with companies involved in the manufacture, sale, and shipment of sensitive export-controlled items.\n\nToured the largest and third-largest commercial ports in the United States\n\nAdded new interagency partners to the effort and enforcement teams to the Strike Force.",

Hamdani.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office (USAO) along with FBI, Homeland Security Investigations, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the Food and Drug Administration provided the training which included essential tools and protocols for TMC attendees to follow if their facilities are subject to cyber intrusions.\n\nMethodist Hospital hosted the training event with attendees from Memorial Herman Hospital, Texas Children\u2019s Hospital, MD Anderson, Baylor College of Medicine and the University of Texas Health System.\n\nCriminal organizations and nation state actors like China, Russia and Iran as well as other bad actors have become more sophisticated in their ability to launch cyber-attacks against critical infrastructure such as the health care facilities in the TMC.\n\n\u201cIt is essential to national security and crucial to the safety of patients for federal law enforcement to work closely with the health care sector to develop resilient and adaptive defenses against malicious cyberspace activity and network intrusions,\u201d said Hamdani. \u201cThe USAO will continue to seek opportunities to enhance collaboration with our law enforcement partners and the health care industry to prevent potential network intrusions and ensure greater unity of effort in response to cyber incidents.\u201d\n\nOn a weekly basis, hundreds of cyberattacks occur on businesses all across the Southern District of Texas. There must be a quick response team in place to immediately address the intrusion in order to circumvent major damage and losses.\u00a0The USAO routinely works with other prosecutors and law enforcement in the district to stay ahead of potential cyber threats.\n\nAs the global economy enters another year of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and China continues to seek to disrupt critical industries like the health care sector, the private industry must be reminded to be diligent about their networks and to know their response plans, have a paper copy available and review their cyber-related insurance policies.\n\nThe USAO has established contact lines for assistance 24 hours a day.

            "article_text": "A criminal complaint was unsealed today in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, charging Moises Luis Zagala Gonzalez (Zagala), also known as \u201cNosophoros,\u201d \u201cAesculapius\u201d and \u201cNebuchadnezzar,\u201d a citizen of France and Venezuela who resides in Venezuela, with attempted computer intrusions and conspiracy to commit computer intrusions.\u00a0 The charges stem from Zagala\u2019s use and sale of ransomware, as well as his extensive support of, and profit sharing arrangements with, the cybercriminals who used his ransomware programs.\n\nBreon Peace, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, and Michael J. Driscoll, Assistant Director-in-Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation, New York Field Office (FBI), announced the charges.\n\n\u201cAs alleged, the multi-tasking doctor treated patients, created and named his cyber tool after death, profited from a global ransomware ecosystem in which he sold the tools for conducting ransomware attacks, trained the attackers about how to extort victims, and then boasted about successful attacks, including by malicious actors associated with the government of Iran,\u201d stated United States Attorney Peace.\u00a0 \u201cCombating ransomware is a top priority of the Department of Justice and of this Office.\u00a0 If you profit from ransomware, we will find you and disrupt your malicious operations.\u201d\n\n\"We allege Zagala not only created and sold ransomware products to hackers, but also trained them in their use. Our actions today will prevent Zagala from further victimizing users. However, many other malicious criminals are searching for businesses and organizations that haven't taken steps to protect their systems - which is an incredibly vital step in stopping the next ransomware attack,\" stated Assistant Director-in-Charge Driscoll.\n\nAs charged in the criminal complaint, Zagala, a 55-year-old cardiologist who resides in Ciudad Bolivar, Venezuela, has designed multiple ransomware tools\u2014malicious software that cybercriminals use to extort money from companies, nonprofits and other institutions, by encrypting those files and then demanding a ransom for the decryption keys.\u00a0 Zagala sold or rented out his software to hackers who used it to attack computer networks.\n\nOne of Zagala\u2019s early products, a ransomware tool called \u201cJigsaw v. 2,\u201d had, in Zagala\u2019s description, a \u201cDoomsday\u201d counter that kept track of how many times the user had attempted to eradicate the ransomware.\u00a0 Zagala wrote: \u201cIf the user kills the ransomware too many times, then its clear he won\u2019t pay so better erase the whole hard drive.\u201d\n\nBeginning in late 2019, Zagala began advertising a new tool online\u2014a \u201cPrivate Ransomware Builder\u201d he called \u201cThanos.\u201d\u00a0 The name of the software appears to be a reference to a fictional cartoon villain named Thanos, who is responsible for destroying half of all life in the universe, as well as a reference to the figure \u201cThanatos\u201d from Greek mythology, who is associated with death.\u00a0 The Thanos software allowed its users to create their own unique ransomware software, which they could then use or rent for use by other cybercriminals.\u00a0 The user interface for the Thanos software is shown below:[1]\n\n\n\nThe screenshot shows, on the right-hand side, an area for \u201cRecovery Information,\u201d in which the user can create a customized ransom note.\u00a0 Other options include a \u201cdata stealer\u201d that specifies the types of files that the ransomware program should steal from the victim computer, an \u201canti-VM\u201d option to defeat the testing environments used by security researchers, and an option, as advertised, to make the ransomware program \u201cself-delete.\u201d\n\nRather than simply sell the Thanos software, Zagala allowed individuals to pay for it in two ways.\u00a0 First, a criminal could buy a \u201clicense\u201d to use the software for a certain period of time.\u00a0 The Thanos software was designed to make periodic contact with a server in Charlotte, North Carolina that Zagala controlled for the purpose of confirming that the user had an active license.[2]Alternatively, a Thanos customer could join what Zagala called an \u201caffiliate program,\u201d in which he provided a user access to the Thanos builder in exchange for a share of the profits from Ransomware attacks. \u00a0Zagala received payment both in fiat currency and cryptocurrency, including Monero and Bitcoin.\n\nZagala advertised the Thanos software on various online forums frequented by cybercriminals, using screennames that referred to Greek mythology.\u00a0 His two preferred nicknames were \u201cAesculapius,\u201d referring to the ancient Greek god of medicine, and \u201cNosophoros,\u201d meaning \u201cdisease-bearing\u201d in Greek.\u00a0 In public advertisements for the program, Zagala bragged that ransomware made using Thanos was nearly undetectable by antivirus programs, and that \u201conce encryption is done,\u201d the ransomware would \u201cdelete itself,\u201d making detection and recovery \u201calmost impossible\u201d for the victim.\n\nIn private chats with customers, Zagala explained to them how to deploy his ransomware products\u2014how to design a ransom note, steal passwords from victim computers, and set a Bitcoin address for ransom payments.\u00a0 As Zagala explained to one customer, discussing Jigsaw: \u201cVictim 1 pays at the given btc [Bitcoin] address and decrypts his files.\u201d\u00a0 Zagala also noted that \u201cthere is a punishment\u2026 [i]f user reboots.\u00a0 For every rerun it will punish you with 1000 files deleted.\u201d\u00a0 After Zagala explained all the features of the software, the customer replied: \u201cSir, I really need to say this . . . You are the best developer ever.\u201d\u00a0 Zagala responded: \u201cThank you that is nice to hear[.]\u00a0 Im very flattered and proud.\u201d\u00a0 Zagala had only one request: \u201cIf you have time and its not too much trouble to you please describe your experience with me\u201d in an online review.\n\nOn or about May 1, 2020, a confidential human source of the FBI (CHS-1) discussed joining Zagala\u2019s \u201caffiliate program.\u201d\u00a0 Zagala responded: \u201cNot for now.\u00a0 Don\u2019t have spots.\u201d\u00a0 But Zagala offered to license the software to CHS-1 for $500 a month with \u201cbasic options,\u201d or $800 with \u201cfull options.\u201d\n\nOn or about October 7, 2020, CHS-1 asked Zagala how to establish an affiliate program of his own using Thanos.\u00a0 Zagala responded with a short tutorial on how to set up a ransomware crew.\u00a0 He explained that CHS-1 should find people \u201cversed\u2026in LAN hacking\u201d and supply them with a version of the Thanos ransomware that was programmed to expire after a given period of time.[3]Zagala said that he personally had \u201ca maximum of between 10-20\u201d affiliates at a given time, and \u201csometimes only 5.\u201d\u00a0 He added that hackers approached him for his software after they had gained access to a victim network:\u00a0 \u201cthey come with access to [b]ig LAN, I check and then I accept[.]\u00a0 they lock several big networks and we wait\u2026If you lock networks without tape or cloud (backups)[,] almost all pay[.]\u201d\n\nZagala further explained that, sometimes, a victim network turned out to have an unexpected backup: \u201cso no point in locking because they have backups, so in that case we only exfiltrate data,\u201d referring to stealing victim information.\u00a0 Zagala further added that he had an associate who \u201cknows how to corrupt tapes,\u201d meaning backups, and how to \u201cdisable[] AV,\u201d meaning antivirus software.\u00a0 Finally, Zagala offered to give CHS-1 an additional two weeks free after CHS-1\u2019s one-month license expired, explaining \u201cbecause 1 month is too little for this business\u2026sometimes you need to work a lot to get good profit.\u201d\n\nZagala\u2019s customers favorably reviewed his products.\u00a0 One individual posted a message praising Thanos in July 2020, writing \u201ci bought the ransomware from nosophoros and it is very powerful,\u201d and claiming that he had used Zagala\u2019s ransomware to infect a network of approximately 3000 computers.\u00a0 And, in December 2020, another user wrote a post in Russian: \u201cWe have been working with this product for over a month now, we have a good profit!\u00a0 Best support I\u2019ve met.\u201d\u00a0 Zagala has publicly discussed his knowledge that his clients used his software to commit ransomware attacks, including by linking to a news story about an Iranian state-sponsored hacking group\u2019s use of Thanos to attack Israeli companies.\n\nIn or around November 2021, Zagala began using a third screenname \u2013 \u201cNebuchadnezzar.\u201d\u00a0 In chats with a second confidential source of the FBI (CHS-2), Zagala stated that he had switched aliases to preserve \u201cOPSEC\u2026 operational security\u201d because \u201cmalware analysts are all over me.\u201d\n\nOn or about May 3, 2022, law enforcement agents conducted a voluntary interview of a relative of Zagala who resides in Florida and whose PayPal account was used by Zagala to receive illicit proceeds.\u00a0 The individual confirmed that Zagala resides in Venezuela and had taught himself computer programming.\u00a0 The individual also showed agents contact information for Zagala in his phone that matched the registered email for malicious infrastructure associated with the Thanos malware.\n\nIf convicted, the defendant faces up to five years\u2019 imprisonment for attempted computer intrusion, and five years\u2019 imprisonment for conspiracy to commit computer intrusions.\n\nThe government\u2019s case is being handled by the Office\u2019s National Security and Cybercrime Section.\u00a0 Assistant United States Attorneys David K. Kessler and Alexander F. Mindlin are in charge of the prosecution.\n\nThe Defendant:\n\nMOISES LUIS ZAGALA GONZALEZAge:\u00a0 55Ciudad Bolivar, Venezuela\n\nE.D.N.Y.

            "article_text": "Two Iranian nationals have been charged in connection with a coordinated cyber intrusion campaign \u2013 sometimes at the behest of the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran (Iran) \u2013 targeting computers in New Jersey, elsewhere in the United States, Europe and the Middle East, the Department of Justice announced today.\n\nAccording to a 10-count indictment returned on Sept. 15, 2020, Hooman Heidarian, a/k/a \u201cneo,\u201d 30, and Mehdi Farhadi, a/k/a \u201cMehdi Mahdavi\u201d and \u201cMohammad Mehdi Farhadi Ramin,\u201d 34, both of Hamedan, Iran, stole hundreds of terabytes of data, which typically included confidential communications pertaining to national security, foreign policy intelligence, non-military nuclear information, aerospace data, human rights activist information, victim financial information and personally identifiable information, and intellectual property, including unpublished scientific research.\u00a0 In some instances, the defendants\u2019 hacks were politically motivated or at the behest of Iran, including instances where they obtained information regarding dissidents, human rights activists, and opposition leaders.\u00a0 In other instances, the defendants sold the hacked data and information on the black market for private financial gain.\n\n\u201cWe will not bring the rule of law to cyberspace until governments refuse to provide safe harbor for criminal hacking within their borders,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers.\u00a0 \u201cUnfortunately, our cases demonstrate that at least four nations \u2014 Iran, China, Russia and North Korea \u2014 will allow criminal hackers to victimize individuals and companies from around the world, as long as these hackers will also work for that country\u2019s government \u2014 gathering information on human rights activists, dissidents and others of intelligence interest.\u00a0 Today\u2019s defendants will now learn that such service to the Iranian regime is not an asset, but a criminal yoke that they will now carry until the day they are brought to justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese Iranian nationals allegedly conducted a wide-ranging campaign on computers here in New Jersey and around the world,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Carpenito for the District of New Jersey. \u201cThey brazenly infiltrated computer systems and targeted intellectual property and often sought to intimidate perceived enemies of Iran, including dissidents fighting for human rights in Iran and around the world. This conduct threatens our national security, and as a result, these defendants are wanted by the FBI and are considered fugitives from justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe indictment of two Iranian nationals charged with computer hacking, fraud, and aggravated identity theft demonstrates how the FBI continues to work relentlessly with our law enforcement partners to identify cybercriminals\u00a0who seek to do harm to American citizens, businesses, and universities,\u00a0regardless of where those criminals may reside and hold them accountable,\u201d said George M. Crouch Jr., Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Newark Division. \u201cMehdi Farhadi and Hooman Heidarian are now fugitives and have been added to the FBI website for charges in connection with a massive, coordinated cyber intrusion campaign. These actions demonstrate how imposing risks and consequences on our cyber adversaries will continue to be a top priority for the FBI.\u201d\n\nAccording to the indictment:\n\nBeginning in at least 2013, the defendants were responsible for a coordinated campaign of cyber intrusions into computer systems in New Jersey and around the world. The victims included several American and foreign universities, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, a defense contractor, an aerospace company, a foreign policy organization, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), non-profits, and foreign government and other entities the defendants identified as rivals or adversaries to Iran.\u00a0 In addition to the theft of highly protected and sensitive data, the defendants also vandalized websites, often under the pseudonym \u201cSejeal\u201d and posted messages that appeared to signal the demise of Iran\u2019s internal opposition, foreign adversaries, and countries identified as rivals to Iran, including Israel and Saudi Arabia.\n\nTo select their victims, the defendants conducted online reconnaissance, including gathering public data and intelligence to determine a victim\u2019s areas of expertise, and using vulnerability scanning tools and other means to assess computer networks. \u00a0The defendants gained and maintained unauthorized access to victim networks using various tools, including: session hijacking, where a valid computer session was exploited to gain unauthorized access to information or services in a computer system; SQL injection, in which they used malicious code to access information that was not intended to be displayed, such as sensitive government data, user details, and personal identifiers; and malicious programs installations, which allowed the defendants to maintain unauthorized access to computers.\n\nThe defendants then used key-loggers and \u201cremote access Trojans\u201d to maintain access and monitor the actions of users of the victim networks. They also developed a botnet tool, which facilitated the spread of malware, denial of service attacks, and spamming to victim networks. In some instances, the defendants used their unauthorized access to victim networks or accounts to establish automated forwarding rules for compromised victim accounts, whereby new outgoing and incoming emails were automatically forwarded from the compromised accounts to accounts controlled by defendants.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Demers and U.S. Attorney Carpenito credited special agents of the FBI, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Crouch in Newark, with the investigation leading to the charges.\n\nEach defendant is charged with: one count of conspiracy to commit fraud and related activity in connection with computers and access devices; unauthorized access to protected computers; unauthorized damage to protected computers; conspiracy to commit wire fraud; and access device fraud; and five counts of aggravated identity theft.\n\nThe counts of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and related activity in connection with computers and access devices, and unauthorized access to protected computers, each carry a maximum sentence of five years in prison. The counts of unauthorized damage to protected computers and access device fraud each carry a maximum sentence of ten years in prison.\u00a0 The count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. The counts of aggravated identity theft each carry a mandatory sentence of two years in prison.\n\nThe government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney Dean C. Sovolos of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office National Security Unit, Daniel V. Shapiro, Deputy Chief of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office Criminal Division, and Trial Attorney Scott McCulloch of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.\n\nThe charges and allegations contained in the indictment are merely accusations and the defendants are considered innocent unless and until proven guilty.",

            "article_text": "NEWARK, N.J. \u2013 Two Iranian nationals have been charged in connection with a coordinated cyber intrusion campaign \u2013 sometimes at the behest of the government of Iran \u2013 targeting computers in New Jersey and around the world, U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito announced today.\n\nHooman Heidarian, a/k/a \u201cneo,\u201d 30, and Mehdi Farhadi, a/k/a \u201cMehdi Mahdavi\u201d and \u201cMohammad Mehdi Farhadi Ramin,\u201d 34, both of Hamedan, Iran, are each charged in a 10-count indictment returned Sept. 15, 2020, with: one count each of conspiracy to commit fraud and related activity in connection with computers and access devices; computer fraud - unauthorized access to protected computers: computer fraud, unauthorized damage to protected computers; conspiracy to commit wire fraud; and access device fraud; and five counts of aggravated identity theft.\n\n\u201cThese Iranian nationals allegedly conducted a wide-ranging campaign on computers here in New Jersey and around the world,\u201d U.S. Attorney Carpenito said. \u201cThey brazenly infiltrated computer systems and targeted intellectual property and often sought to intimidate perceived enemies of Iran, including dissidents fighting for human rights in Iran and around the world. This conduct threatens our national security, and as a result, these defendants are wanted by the FBI and are considered fugitives from justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will not bring the rule of law to cyberspace until governments refuse to provide safe harbor for criminal hacking within their borders,\u201d Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers said. \u201cUnfortunately, our cases demonstrate that at least four nations\u2014Iran, China, Russia and North Korea\u2014will allow criminal hackers to victimize individuals and companies from around the world, as long as these hackers will also work for that country\u2019s government\u2014gathering information on human rights activists, dissidents and others of intelligence interest.\u00a0 Today\u2019s defendants will now learn that such service to the Iranian regime is not an asset, but a criminal yoke that they will now carry until the day they are brought to justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe indictment of two Iranian nationals charged with computer hacking, fraud, and aggravated identity theft demonstrates how the FBI continues to work relentlessly with our law enforcement partners to identify cybercriminals\u00a0who seek to do harm to American citizens, businesses, and universities,\u00a0regardless of where those criminals may reside and hold them accountable,\u201d George M. Crouch Jr., Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Newark Division, said. \u201cMehdi Farhadi and Hooman Heidarian are now fugitives and have been added to the FBI website for charges in connection with a massive, coordinated cyber intrusion campaign. These actions demonstrate how imposing risks and consequences on our cyber adversaries will continue to be a top priority for the FBI.\u201d\n\nAccording to the indictment:\n\nBeginning in at least 2013, the defendants were responsible for a coordinated campaign of cyber intrusions into computer systems in New Jersey and around the world. The victims included several American and foreign universities, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, a defense contractor, an aerospace company, a foreign policy organization, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), non-profits, and foreign government and other entities identified as rivals or adversaries to Iran around the world.\n\nHeidarian and Farhadi conducted many of these intrusions on behalf of the Iranian government. The stolen data was typically highly protected and extremely sensitive, and included confidential communications pertaining to national security, foreign policy intelligence, non-military nuclear information, aerospace data, human rights activist information, victim financial information and personally identifiable information, and intellectual property, including unpublished scientific research. The defendants also often vandalized websites using the pseudonym \u201cSejeal\u201d and posted messages that appeared to signal the demise of Iran\u2019s internal opposition, foreign adversaries, and countries identified as rivals to Iran, including Israel and Saudi Arabia.\n\nTactics and Techniques\n\nThe defendants conducted online reconnaissance to carefully select their victims, gathering data and intelligence to determine their areas of expertise, and assessing computer networks in preparation for launching cyber-attacks. They often used information obtained at this stage in latter phases of their hacking activities to complete a picture of processes, organizational structure, and potential soft spots of victim networks. The defendants used vulnerability-scanning tools to test the victim networks and to reveal security holes.\n\nThe defendants gained and maintained unauthorized access to victim networks using various tools, including: session hijacking, where a valid computer session was exploited to gain unauthorized access to information or services in a computer system; SQL injection, in which they used malicious code to access information that was not intended to be displayed, such as sensitive government data, user details, and personal identifiers; and malicious programs installations, which allowed the defendants to maintain unauthorized access to computers.\n\nThe defendants then used key-loggers and \u201cremote access Trojans\u201d to maintain access and monitor the actions of users of the victim networks. They also developed a botnet tool, which facilitated the spread of malware, denial of service attacks, and spamming to victim networks. In some instances, the defendants used their unauthorized access to victim networks or accounts to establish automated forwarding rules for compromised victim accounts, whereby new outgoing and incoming emails were automatically forwarded from the compromised accounts to accounts controlled by defendants\n\nUsing these methods, the defendants stole hundreds of terabytes of data, including confidential victim work product and intellectual property, and personal identifying information, such as access credentials, names, addresses, phone numbers, Social Security numbers, and birthdates. The defendants marketed stolen data on the black market.\n\nIn addition to stealing intellectual property and other data, the defendants, using the pseudonym \u201cSejeal,\u201d replaced the publicly available contents of websites with political and other ideological content, thereby defacing websites, for the apparent purpose of projecting Iranian influence and threatening perceived enemies of Iran. The defacements featured, among other things, images of burning Israeli flags and threats forecasting the death or demise of citizens in the United States, Israel, and elsewhere.\n\nU.S. Attorney Carpenito credited special agents of the FBI, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Crouch in Newark, with the investigation leading to the charges.\n\nThe counts of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and related activity in connection with computers and access devices, unauthorized access to protected computers, and computer fraud \u2013 unauthorized damage to protected computers, each carry a maximum sentence of five years in prison. The count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. The counts of aggravated identity theft each carry a mandatory sentence of two years in prison. The count of access device fraud carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.\n\nThe government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney Dean C. Sovolos of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office National Security Unit, Daniel V. Shapiro, Deputy Chief of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office Criminal Division, and Trial Attorney Scott McCulloch of the National Security Division.\n\nThe charges and allegations contained in the indictment are merely accusations and the defendants are considered innocent unless and until proven guilty.",

            "article_text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Vincent H. Cohen, Jr. announced today that he is resigning as Acting United States Attorney for the District of Columbia, effective at midnight, Oct. 18, 2015. He has led the Office for six months, following nearly five years as Principal Assistant U.S. Attorney.\n\nActing U.S. Attorney Cohen, 45, a native Washingtonian, succeeded Ronald C. Machen Jr. as the head of the nation\u2019s largest U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office on April 1, 2015. Acting U.S. Attorney Cohen had served since July 2010 as Principal Assistant U.S. Attorney.\n\nFollowing the recommendation of Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, President Obama has nominated Channing D. Phillips as the next U.S. Attorney, pending Senate confirmation.\n\n\u201cOver the past six months, Vince Cohen has served the District of Columbia as Acting United States Attorney with integrity and distinction,\u201d said Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch.\u00a0 \u201cThrough his work against violent crime, drug trafficking, and national security threats, Vince has demonstrated his commitment to service and his dedication to the people of Washington.\u00a0 I have been proud to serve with Vince for many years, and I'm confident that he will continue to be an exemplary leader and a champion of justice in the next phase of his already distinguished career.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has been a great honor to serve the people of the District of Columbia over the past five years. There is nothing more rewarding than going into work every day with the single goal of improving the lives of the citizens of the city where I was born and raised,\u201d said Acting U.S. Attorney Cohen. \u201cWe have made great progress over the past five years in fighting violent crime, public corruption, and threats to our national security.\u00a0 There are some important cases that I wish I could see through to their conclusions, but I have complete confidence in the team at the U.S. Attorney's Office to follow through and do justice for the people of the District.\u00a0Channing Phillips is a seasoned lawyer with the decades of experience that will allow him to successfully carry on the important work of the Office.\u00a0 In addition to spending more time with my young children, I am looking forward to taking on new professional opportunities and continuing to find ways to serve my hometown.\u00a0 I want to thank my colleagues at the U.S. Attorney's Office, our community partners, law enforcement partners, and everyone who has offered their support of our efforts to build a stronger and safer District of Columbia.\u201d\n\nDuring Mr. Cohen\u2019s time as Acting U.S. Attorney, the Office secured indictments, convictions, and sentences of dozens of defendants accused of engaging in crimes such as terrorism, financial fraud, public corruption, and homicides. Mr. Cohen also placed a high priority on enforcing federal laws against banks involved in moving money illegally through the U.S. financial system on behalf of sanctioned countries and foreign entities. Under his leadership, the Office also secured millions of dollars from companies accused of violating the False Claims Act and cheating American taxpayers by overbilling the federal government. He helped create and expand the Office\u2019s Cyber Unit to combat cyber-based crimes. Mr. Cohen also played an integral role in the creation of the first federal Conviction Integrity Unit in a United States Attorney\u2019s Office. He has emphasized the importance of community outreach, hosting a youth summit and other events, including visits to homeless shelters, in which he warned of the dangers of using synthetic cannabinoids.\n\nAs Acting U.S. Attorney, Mr. Cohen was appointed by Attorney General Lynch as a member of the Attorney General\u2019s Advisory Committee, a small group of U.S. Attorneys from across the country who provide advice and counsel to the Attorney General on policy, management, and operational issues. Mr. Cohen also worked in partnership with a wide variety of law enforcement and regulatory agencies that investigate financial matters, including the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n\n**\n\nNational Security:Mr. Cohen supervised the Office\u2019s work on the ongoing case against Ahmed Abu Khatallah for his alleged participation in the 2012 attack on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya, which resulted in the deaths of four Americans. Among other cases, he oversaw work on the prosecution of a dual Dutch-Turkish national, who was extradited to the United States in July 2015 to face terrorism charges stemming from his alleged support of a designated foreign terrorist organization and the prosecution of a Mexican national extradited to the United States last month to face charges in the murder of a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Special Agent and the attempted murder of another.\n\nFraud and Public Corruption:For the past several years, Mr. Cohen has led an internal task force focused on local public corruption matters. He helped supervise the work that led to the convictions of three members of the District of Columbia Council and the Chief of Staff to a fourth member of the Council. In addition, he has helped manage the Office\u2019s work leading to the prosecution of eight individuals for wrongdoing associated with the 2010 election for Mayor of the District of Columbia. Under Mr. Cohen\u2019s leadership, the Office continued work on the investigation into the largest domestic bribery and bid-rigging scheme in the history of federal contracting cases. Overall, participants in the scheme stole over $30 million in government money through fictitious invoices and conspired to steer a nearly $1 billion government contract to a favored government contractor.\u00a0 The Office also obtained a 64-month prison sentence in the case of a former U.S. Foreign Service Officer, who accepted over $3 million in bribes to process visas for non-immigrants seeking entry into the United States; a 13-year sentence for a man who operated a $28 million Ponzi scheme; a 17-year sentence for a businessman who took part in an investment fraud scheme that led to over $13 million in losses for investors, and a 46-month sentence for a man who participated in a massive identify theft and tax fraud scheme involving the filing of fraudulent income tax returns seeking over $2.5 million in refunds. Overall, since 2010, under Mr. Cohen\u2019s leadership, more than 150 people have been found guilty or pled guilty to federal corruption charges.\n\nFinancial Recoveries:As Acting U.S. Attorney, and earlier in partnership with Mr. Machen, Mr. Cohen sharpened the Office\u2019s focus on financial recoveries, generating over $2.8 billion for the federal government over the last five and a half years through civil and criminal collections and asset forfeiture.\u00a0 In one such case, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a formal judgment in May 2015 that required Schlumberger Oilfield Holdings Ltd. (SOHL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Schlumberger Ltd., to pay a $232,708,356 penalty to the United States for conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) by willfully facilitating illegal transactions and engaging in trade with Iran and Sudan.\n\nUnder Mr. Cohen\u2019s leadership, the Office\u2019s Civil Division has expanded its work on affirmative civil enforcement actions. A particular focus has been the False Claims Act. The Office now has 159 active cases, including over 40 involving health care fraud. Mr. Cohen has built a strong relationship with thequi tamcommunity by hosting a conference of the Relator\u2019s bar and participating in similar conferences and forums. The Office now has the fourth-highest number ofqui tamcases in the country.\n\nFor example, in April 2015, two cardiovascular laboratories agreed to pay $48.5 million to resolve allegations that they violated the False Claims Act by paying remuneration to physicians in exchange for patient referrals and billing federal health care programs for medically unnecessary testing. Another company and its principals agreed in July 2015 to pay the government $7.8 million to resolve allegations that they made false statements to obtain contracts through a Small Business Administration program.\n\nCyber-crime:Mr. Cohen has focused his attention on expanding the Cyber Unit to attack cyber-crimes throughout the country and internationally. The Unit investigates and prosecutes a wide variety of cyber-crimes and advises and assists other parts of the Office with issues related to electronic, computer and Internet-based evidence and legal process. In one recent case, for example, a former employee of the U.S. Department of Energy and U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission is accused of an attempted e-mail spear-phishing attack that targeted government employee e-mail accounts.\n\nViolent Crime:As Acting U.S. Attorney, Mr. Cohen has focused heavily on strategies to combat violent crime, coordinating a multi-faceted approach with the Metropolitan Police Department and federal law enforcement partners. He has helped coordinate efforts to devote more federal resources to assisting MPD in dealing with this problem, working closely with the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, and other agencies. During his leadership, Mr. Cohen led the Office\u2019s work to deal with the public safety and health problems stemming from the emergence of synthetic cannabinoids. At his direction, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office has launched community education sessions in which prosecutors and D.C. drug prevention experts talk about the dangers of these substances at various locations throughout the District of Columbia. On the enforcement front, the Office is prosecuting sellers of synthetic cannabinoids, and filed federal charges against two men after one of the biggest seizures to date in the District of Columbia.\n\nCommunity Outreach:Mr. Cohen has been a champion of community outreach throughout his time at the Office, and he led the fifth annual youth summit in June 2015 attended by hundreds of teenagers at the Friendship Collegiate Academy in Northeast Washington. He has spoken at town halls and other neighborhood events. Internally, Mr. Cohen has continued his work on recruiting and diversity. He spoke at the LGBT Bar\u2019s annual conference in Chicago and attended the annual conferences of the National Bar Association and the Hispanic National Bar Association. In addition, he delivered the keynote address in July 2015 at the gala for the conference of the National Black Prosecutors Association. As the head of the Office\u2019s hiring committee, Mr. Cohen was responsible for the hiring of over 150 Assistant U.S. Attorneys, many of whom are from diverse backgrounds.\n\n**\n\nMr. Cohen graduated with honors from Syracuse University in 1992 and obtained his juris doctorate from Syracuse University School of Law in 1995. He first joined the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in 1997 following his hiring by then-U.S. Attorney Eric Holder. Mr. Cohen handled criminal and civil matters until 2003, when he left the Office for private practice.\n\nIn private practice, Mr. Cohen first worked at Hogan & Hartson (now Hogan Lovells), specializing in white-collar criminal litigation and employment law. Mr. Cohen later became a partner at Schertler & Onorato, where his practice included the representation of individuals and corporations in all aspects of criminal and civil litigation.",

Kullyand Trial AttorneysWilliam H. Jones II,John R. Read,Adam C. SpeegleandNathan P. Sutton; from the Antitrust Division\u2019s Appellate Section, Section ChiefKristen C.

Fleming; and from the Criminal Division\u2019s Appellate Section, Trial AttorneyFinnuala K. Tessier.\n\nThe Antitrust Division\u2019s victory against Apple Inc. for orchestrating a conspiracy to raise the prices of e-books represents one of the most significant civil litigation victories that the division has achieved in over a decade, and it has led to state attorneys general and private plaintiffs recovering on behalf of harmed consumers approximately $566 million in damages.\u00a0 The recipients represented the United States in trial against Apple in June 2013 and successfully defended the case against Apple\u2019s appeal.\u00a0 In April 2010, when Apple launched its iBookstore and entered the e-books market, U.S. e-book prices rose uniformly, in some instances as much as 50 percent.\u00a0 The division launched an investigation into possible coordination among e-book publishers and Apple and, in April 2012, brought suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging a conspiracy to raise e-book prices in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.\u00a0 Over the course of the litigation, all the publishers settled with the federal government.\u00a0 However, Apple aggressively litigated the matter through a three-week trial in June 2013 before U.S. District Judge Denise Cote, who issued a 160-page order finding Apple liable for orchestrating a scheme among five of the six largest book publishers to raise e-book prices in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.\u00a0 Apple\u2019s vigorous efforts to pursue the matter on appeal ended in March 2016 when the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) rejected Apple\u2019s petition for certiorari to review the Second Circuit\u2019s decision affirming Judge Cote\u2019s order.\u00a0 The litigation of this action and the precedent created by the trial court\u2019s and Second Circuit\u2019s decisions should deter those who in the future might contemplate violating U.S. antitrust laws.\n\nThe third Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the Antitrust Division\u2019s New York Office, Section ChiefJeffrey D.

Dornbos.\n\nThe recipients, through their leadership, dedication and tireless investigation of price fixing and bid rigging, are responsible for the historic prosecution of five of the world\u2019s largest financial institutions that agreed to pay fines in excess of $2.7 billion.\u00a0 The investigation uncovered a conspiracy that affected the U.S. Dollar to Euro exchange rate.\u00a0 These currencies are at the heart of international commerce, and the conspiracy undermined the integrity and the competitiveness of foreign currency exchange markets which account for hundreds of billions of dollars of transactions every day.\u00a0 The companies responsible for actions that eliminated competition in the marketplace were held accountable for their illegal conduct, which will hopefully deter financial institutions from chasing profits without regard to fairness, the law or the public welfare.\n\nThe fourth Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the Office of the Solicitor General, Assistant to the Solicitor GeneralEric J. Feigin; from the Civil Rights Division\u2019s Appellate Section, ChiefDiana K. Flynn, Principal Deputy ChiefSharon M. McGowanand Trial AttorneyRobert A.

Hodges, SCOTUS struck down state bans on marriage equality that denied to same-sex couples and their children the protections and benefits of marriage.\u00a0 In doing so, SCOTUS granted LGBT individuals equal access to marriage and vindicated the Obama Administration\u2019s strong interest in the eradication of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.\u00a0 This team is honored for its extraordinary work in this historic case.\u00a0 Under immense time pressures, the recipients worked collaboratively to craft a compelling, persuasive and successful legal brief on a seminal civil rights issue.\u00a0 The brief reiterated the department\u2019s US v. Windsor position that classifications based on sexual orientation should trigger heightened scrutiny and described the harm that the state bans inflicted on same-sex couples and their families.\u00a0 In June 2015, SCOTUS issued a powerful decision extending the right to marry to same-sex couples and joining the ranks of landmark civil rights pronouncements from the court.\n\nThe fifth Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the Criminal Division\u2019s Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section, Deputy ChiefMatthew R. Stiglitz, Special CounselStacey Luckand Paralegal SpecialistLinda Faulk; from the Criminal Division\u2019s Office of International Affairs, Associate DirectorMagdalena Boynton; from the Criminal Division\u2019s Narcotic and Dangerous Drug Division, Judicial Attach\u00e9Marlon Cobar; from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office of the Eastern District of Virginia, Assistant U.S. AttorneyMichael P.

StanleyandJeffrey D. Tarpinian.\n\nThe recipients are recognized for their involvement in Operation Torpedo, a precedent-setting investigation that used first-of-its-kind techniques to infiltrate the dark internet and identify individuals who, under the perceived cloak of anonymity, secretly congregated to trade images of children being sexually abused and to celebrate the sexual abuse of children.\u00a0 By developing and deploying a network investigative technique, with appropriate legal authority, investigators were able to identify members of three websites devoted to child pornography that were operating on an anonymous network.\u00a0 The investigation required round-the-clock efforts from agents, analysts and prosecutors, and rapid response to fast-breaking developments.\u00a0 Prosecutors successfully defended these novel investigations in court and have obtained convictions at every turn.\u00a0 The impact of this investigation cannot be overstated.\u00a0 It has pioneered investigative work into the dark web that has led to subsequent significant investigations by the Criminal Division and the FBI; the dismantling of more than 100 child exploitation websites; and the seizure of massive amounts of child exploitation material, the largest seizure of virtual currency to date and the discovery of 120 victims of child sexual exploitation.\n\nThe seventh Distinguished Service Award is presented to Deputy ChiefFranz R. Marshallof the Civil Rights Division\u2019s Educational Opportunities Section.\u00a0 Marshall is recognized for his remarkable 43 years of service to the department, virtually all of which has been spent in the Civil Rights Division, where he has dedicated each day to breaking down barriers to educational opportunities for students across the country.\u00a0 Over the course of his career, he has represented the United States in hundreds of desegregation cases and through this work, Marshall has fiercely protected and embodied a core and founding mission of the Civil Rights Division, dismantling obstacles to opportunity and success in America\u2019s public schools.\u00a0 Furthermore, Marshall has shaped the legal landscape and cleared paths to a better life for countless students.\u00a0 He has given voice to children and parents in communities throughout the United States, from Native Americans in the Four Corners to African Americans in the Louisiana Bayou.\u00a0 In short, no department lawyer has done more to open the schoolhouse doors to all children and to fulfill the principles and promise of Brown v. Board of Education.\n\nThe eighth Distinguished Service Award is presented to, from the Environment and Natural Resources Division\u2019s Environmental Enforcement Section, Section ChiefThomas A.

Alvarez,Jeffrey N. Kaplan,Lawrence D. LaVecchio,Alison W. Lehr,Paul F. Schwartz,Evelyn B. SheehanandMadeleine Shirleyof the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Florida.\n\nIn October 2009, it was discovered that attorney Scott Rothstein was conducting one of the largest Ponzi schemes in American history through the operation of the Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, law firm of Rothstein Rosenfeldt & Adler P.A. (RRA).\u00a0 The basis of the scheme was the sale of securities in which investors purchased the rights to a stream of payments from corporate entities which ostensibly had reached confidential settlements with purported plaintiffs in sexual harassment, employment discrimination and whistleblower cases.\u00a0 Settlements were available for purchase in amounts ranging from hundreds of thousands to tens of millions of dollars.\u00a0 During the operation of the scheme, hundreds of investors remitted more than $1.2 billion to RRA, which funds were utilized to pay previous investors in the scheme to finance a lavish lifestyle for the participants, and to make political and charitable contributions which enhanced the prestige and visibility of RRA, thereby enhancing RRA\u2019s ability to attract new investors.\u00a0 During the ensuing six years of litigation, 29 defendants, including attorneys and public officials, were convicted and sentenced on charges including racketeering, wire fraud, money laundering, income tax fraud, campaign finance violations, obstruction of justice, extortion and civil rights violations.\u00a0 Additionally, through forfeiture proceedings instituted by the government, coupled with proceedings in bankruptcy court and other ancillary civil proceedings, more than $400 million in assets were ultimately recovered, resulting in full restitution to the defrauded investors.\n\nThe 10thDistinguished Service Award is presented to, from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office of the Southern District of New York, Assistant U.S. AttorneysJohn P.

Butsch; and from the National Security Division\u2019s Office of the Assistant Attorney General, Deputy Assistant Attorney GeneralGeorge Z. Toscas.\n\nFor upwards of a decade, Abu Hamza stood as one of the most powerful, dangerous and recognizable terrorist leaders on the planet.\u00a0 Through his oratorical skills and sophisticated use of the internet, he indoctrinated his young, impressionable followers with his murderous message, inspiring the likes of Richard Reid, Zacarias Moussaoui and Mohammed Siddiqui Kahn.\u00a0 Additionally, Abu Hamza himself engaged in acts of terror that spanned the globe including the December 1998 hostage-taking in Yemen, which included two U.S. citizens and left four victims dead; the attempt to establish a terrorist training camp for al Qaeda on U.S. soil in late 1999; sending of one of his devoted followers to Afghanistan in 2000 to train and fight with al Qaeda; and supporting the Taliban from 2000 to 2001.\u00a0 Abu Hamza was arrested in the United Kingdom in 2004, but fought extradition for nearly a decade before he was extradited in October 2012.\u00a0 In preparing for trial, the recipients analyzed massive volumes of evidence recovered from across the globe, and identified witnesses in multiple continents to build and solidify a criminal case.\u00a0 The team also engaged in classified and unclassified litigation leading to and during trial, working in close coordination with the U.S. intelligence community to protect national security equities.\u00a0 Overcoming the inherent challenges in prosecuting a case where the conduct occurred approximately 15 years earlier, and where the evidence and witnesses were spread across the globe, the team secured a conviction on all 11 counts.\u00a0 Furthermore, Abu Hamza has been permanently incapacitated from future terrorist acts.\n\nThe 11thDistinguished Service Award is presented to, from the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office, Supervisory Special AgentWilliam J.

Flanaganand Program AnalystsTanique D. CarterandMichael H. Chang.\n\nThis team led a comprehensive review of the impact that an aging inmate population has on the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP).\u00a0 The elimination of parole, use of mandatory minimum sentences, increases in average sentence length over the past three decades and an increase in white collar offenders and sex offenders, among other things, have contributed to the aging federal inmate population.\u00a0 The recipients were in the field for eight months, interviewing nearly 170 officials and staff from each of the BOP\u2019s eight divisions, as well as 13 institutions.\u00a0 The team conducted site visits of institutions at all security levels, and did extensive document reviews and quantitative analysis spanning a five-year period.\u00a0 Policies applying to various aspects of the care of aging inmates were numerous and scattered among different program areas.\u00a0 To overcome limitations in available data, the team conducted wide-ranging quantitative analyses.\u00a0 The OIG report, issued in May 2015, found that aging inmates are more costly to incarcerate due to increased medical needs, that the physical infrastructure of BOP institutions limits the availability of appropriate housing for aging inmates and that BOP does not provide programming opportunities designed to meet their particular needs.\u00a0 The report also found that aging inmates engage in fewer misconduct incidents while incarcerated and, based on statistical review, appear to have a lower rate of re-arrest once released.\u00a0 Beyond merely identifying these issues, the report provided eight concrete recommendations to address them in order to assist BOP in managing its aging inmate population.\u00a0 After reviewing the report and recommendations, the BOP created formed an interdisciplinary task force to address a number of the recommendations.\n\nTheAttorney General\u2019s Award for Exceptional Service in Indian Countryrecognizes extraordinary efforts by department employees who demonstrate the department\u2019s commitment to fighting crime in Indian Country. \u00a0This year\u2019s award is presented to, from the Criminal Division\u2019s Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section, Trial AttorneyJ.

GlassandLisa A. Scanlon; and Trial AttorneysSteven B. Kramer,Kelsey W. ShannonandJeffrey G. Vernon.\u00a0 The Antitrust Division\u2019s high-profile victory at trial blocking General Electric\u2019s (GE) attempt to sell its appliances business to Electrolux represents one of the most significant merger trial victories the division has achieved in decades, and has directly helped tens of millions of U.S. consumers who purchase appliances each year.\u00a0 On July 1, 2015, the United States brought suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against GE and Electrolux, alleging that their proposed merger would raise appliance prices.\u00a0 In November 2015, trial began in before U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of the District of Columbia.\u00a0 During a five-week, highly publicized trial, the trial team made its case largely through the documents and adverse testimony of GE and Electrolux, uncooperative competitors and economic analysis, demonstrating that the merger would have a significant effect on the prices of ranges, cooktops and wall ovens.\u00a0 One day before trial was to conclude, GE abandoned the proposed merger and as a result, U.S. consumers will be able to save hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nThe secondJohn Marshall Award for Trial of Litigationis presented to the team responsible for the prosecution and conviction of Jeffrey Sterling.\u00a0 As a result of their tireless efforts over the course of several years, Sterling was found guilty of unauthorized disclosures of classified information vital to national security in the first Espionage Act trial of its kind in decades.\u00a0 The successful outcome was the result of over four years of complex pre-trial litigation involving classified information, covert witnesses, First Amendment issues and media subpoenas.\u00a0 At trial, the prosecutors proved that Sterling, a former CIA officer, disclosed to a journalist the details of an extremely sensitive, valuable and classified clandestine operation designed to undermine the Iranian nuclear weapons program.\u00a0 Sterling\u2019s crime not only undermined a valuable tool to attack Iran\u2019s nuclear program, but also endangered the lives of an important human asset and his family.\u00a0 The defendant\u2019s unlawful disclosures put lives at risk and constituted an egregious breach of the public trust.\u00a0 Sterling was sentenced to 42 months in prison.\u00a0 This case demonstrates the perseverance, tenacity and commitment of the prosecution team in overcoming formidable challenges in bringing this uniquely complex case to trial in the interests of justice and national security.\u00a0 Award recipients include, from the Criminal Division\u2019s Public Integrity Section, Deputy ChiefEric G. Olshan; and from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office of the Eastern District of Virginia, Assistant U.S. AttorneyDennis M. Fitzpatrickand Senior Litigation CounselJames L. Trump.\n\nThe firstJohn Marshall Award for Participation in Litigationis presented to, from the Civil Rights Division, Office of the Assistant Attorney General Senior CounselRegina Kline, Acting Chief of the Policy and Strategy SectionSheila M. Foran, Disability Rights Section Trial AttorneysNicholas C. LeeandH. Justin Parkand Housing and Civil Enforcement Section Trial AttorneyMax P. Lapertosa; and from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office of the District of Oregon, Assistant U.S. AttorneyAdrian L. Brown.\u00a0 This team is honored for its extraordinary work in securing \u2013 alongside private plaintiffs \u2013 the landmark settlement agreement remedying systemic discrimination in Oregon\u2019s employment service system for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD).\u00a0 Through the team\u2019s outstanding oral and written advocacy, a groundbreaking settlement was achieved in Lane v. Brown, the nation\u2019s first class-action lawsuit to challenge a state funded and administered employment service system, relying primarily on sheltered workshops, as a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act\u2019s (ADA) integration mandate.\u00a0 Throughout the more than three-year litigation, the team demonstrated exemplary dedication, as well as outstanding advocacy and strategy, that successfully positioned the department and private plaintiffs to obtain a comprehensive settlement agreement providing relief to approximately 7,000 people with I/DD.\u00a0 These individuals include 1,115 adults with I/DD, who have been relegated for far too long in segregated sheltered workshops when they were able and wanted to work in real jobs in the community, and roughly 4,900 youth with I/DD who will now receive employment services to choose, prepare for, get and keep jobs in a typical setting.\u00a0 The team\u2019s accomplishment serves as a model for integrated employment of persons with disabilities nationwide.\n\nThe secondJohn Marshall Award for Participation in Litigationrecognizes Assistant U.S. AttorneysLara K. EshkenaziandJeffrey K. Powellof the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York.\u00a0 As a result of the extraordinary work of the recipients, New York City\u2019s jail system is now subject to sweeping court-ordered reforms to counter the pervasive culture of violence that has plagued it for decades and has inflicted tremendous harm on inmates and correction officers alike.\u00a0 After its rigorous investigation into the treatment of adolescent inmates on Rikers Island, the team drafted a scathing 79-page report that concluded that male inmates between the ages of 16 and 18 were subject to rampant use of unnecessary and excessive force by correction staff, were not being adequately protected from violence inflicted by other inmates, and were being placed in punitive segregation for weeks or months at a time at an alarming rate.\u00a0 To force desperately needed reforms, the Southern District of New York intervened in an ongoing class action alleging a system-wide pattern and practice of excessive force.\u00a0 The recipients led the parties through many months of difficult negotiations which resulted in a groundbreaking consent decree requiring comprehensive and innovative reform designed to end the unconstitutional violence on Rikers Island.\u00a0 The consent decree also prohibits the use of punitive segregation for inmates under the age of 18.\u00a0 In approving the settlement, the district court judge described the agreement as \u201cthe product of unprecedented analysis, investigation, collaboration, commitment to the protection of rights and vision for systemic reform,\u201d and noted that it \u201cprovides an important example for other correctional systems throughout the country.\u201d\n\nThe firstJohn Marshall Award for Support of Litigationis presented to Assistant DirectorReginald T.

Gary Woods, allowing for the imposition of accuracy-related penalties in transactions lacking economic substance.\u00a0 His work has saved and will continue to save the government hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue, and has contributed to the development of the law in a manner that enhances the integrity and fairness of the federal tax system.\n\nTheJohn Marshall Award for Providing Legal Adviceis presented to the team responsible for in reviewing executive orders and attorney general orders for form and legality.\u00a0 Together, the recipients ensure that the orders are lawful and presented in proper form.\u00a0 They perform this daunting and critical task with supreme skill, integrity and care, and frequently on an extremely short timeline.\u00a0 Moreover, the team\u2019s behind-the-scenes work is critical to the integrity and success of every order the President of the United States or Attorney General signs.\u00a0 The recipients are, from the Office of Legal Counsel, Special CounselRosemary A. Hart, Senior CounselMatthew D. Robertsand Attorney-AdvisersMartine E. Cicconi,Kirti Datla,Nathan A. Forrester,Laura E. Heim,KelleyBrooke Hostetler,Jane E. Nitze,Annie L.

Welk.\n\nThis team is honored for its contributions to the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative through its civil forfeiture of bribe proceeds paid to the former President of the Republic of Korea, Chun Doo Hwan.\u00a0 After seizing power in 1979, Chun went on to earn a salary of approximately $20,000 per year from 1980 through 1988.\u00a0 When he was ultimately convicted of corruption crimes by South Korea in 1997, the trial court established that Chun had received more than $200 million in bribes during his presidency and ordered him to pay restitution in that amount.\u00a0 Stymied in their efforts to collect on Chun\u2019s restitution order, in 2013, Korean prosecutors turned to the department for assistance.\u00a0 Undaunted by the age of the evidence, the team pieced together financial and testimonial evidence sufficient to show that a portion of Chun\u2019s bribe proceeds were paid through intermediaries, transferred out of Korea in the names of shell corporations and ultimately invested into various properties in the United States.\u00a0 On Nov. 9, 2015, Attorney General Lynch celebrated the successful conclusion of this case by presenting the Korean Minister of Justice with an embossed copy of a forfeiture order and congratulating South Korea on having recovered more than $28.7 million as a result of the team\u2019s efforts.\n\nThis year\u2019sJohn Marshall Award for Alternative Dispute Resolutionis presented to the Crow Tribe Water Rights Settlement Team for the negotiation, defense and implementation of a settlement between the state of Montana, the Crow Nation and the United States that confirms the federal water rights of the Crow Nation arising from its 1868 treaty.\u00a0 The settlement, a decades-long effort, brings much-needed water, infrastructure and economic development to the Crow Reservation in Montana and allows the tribe to thrive on its reservation.\u00a0 The awardees are recognized for their creative and exemplary work in developing, negotiating and implementing a settlement approved by the Montana Legislature and subsequently ratified and altered by Congress.\u00a0 The team then defended the settlement in state and federal courts.\u00a0 Their work began with the negotiation of an agreement in the late 1990s, resolving contentious water rights issues as well as mineral severance taxation issues heard by SCOTUS.\u00a0 The team\u2019s successful completion of this extraordinary process makes clean drinking water, improved irrigation facilities and economic development opportunities available on the Crow Indian Reservation and confirms promises made to the Crow Nation in 1868.\n\nThe awardees are, from the Environment and Natural Resources Division\u2019s Indian Resources Section, Section ChiefS.

Smeltzer.\n\nTheAttorney General\u2019s Award for Outstanding Contributions by a New Employeerecognizes exceptional performance and notable accomplishments towards the department\u2019s mission by an employee with fewer than five years of federal career service.\n\nThe first Outstanding Contributions by a New Employee Award is presented toCriminal Division Appellate Section AttorneyRoss B. Goldman.\u00a0 Goldman has proven himself to be an extraordinary and productive appellate advocate, who masterfully handles complex, large-record appeals.\u00a0 Although his cases have run the gamut from street crime to securities fraud, Goldman has brought his sophisticated analysis to two areas that bedevil the courts and prosecutors; insider trading, where he drafted a SCOTUS merits brief and a certiorari petition, and extraterritoriality, where, in one case, he defended the murder conviction of a Colombian national who murdered a DEA agent in Bogota and, in a second case, assisted the Solicitor General in formulating arguments on the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act\u2019s extraterritorial reach.\u00a0 He not only volunteers to take on extra work within the division, but he also seized the opportunity to review commutation applications filed by convicted drug traffickers because he believes so strongly in the Obama Administration\u2019s initiative to provide relief to nonviolent offenders who have already served significant prison terms.\u00a0 Finally, Goldman serves on the division\u2019s Diversity Committee and mentors a minority law student.\u00a0 He understands the department\u2019s mission writ large and he gives his best at all times.\n\nThe second Outstanding Contributions by a New Employee Award is presented to Special AgentAdebowale Babarinde Aladeof the FBI\u2019s San Antonio Field Office.\u00a0 Alade was the lead investigator on a 32-month complex criminal investigation targeting the Almighty Latin King Nation (ALKN), a violent transnational criminal enterprise operating in Texas with connections across the United States and overseas.\u00a0 With less than one year in the FBI, and still serving as a probationary agent, Alade demonstrated exceptional initiative by carefully exploiting human source information in early 2013, resulting in the identification of a key leader of the ALKN with control over operations in Texas.\u00a0 He determined that the ALKN was importing and distributing large quantities of narcotics from Mexico-based cartels, and was also involved in weapons trafficking with access to military-grade weapons and grenades.\u00a0 After obtaining Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces designation, Alade relentlessly pursued ALKN\u2019s illicit activities, ultimately targeting its command and control structure through the use of sophisticated techniques involving the interception of communications through Title III court orders.\u00a0 During 2014, Alade exploited intelligence derived from ALKN communications and human sources, and developed a cohesive interagency team by sharing information with law enforcement partners, resulting in a collaborative effort to target the ALKN.\u00a0 In October 2015, his work resulted in the indictment of 48 members of the ALKN, including its entire leadership structure in Texas, on RICO Act and drug conspiracy charges, as well as state drug violations.\u00a0 Alade subsequently led the multiagency enforcement operation that disrupted the ALKN, resulting in the seizure of narcotics and firearms, thousands of rounds of ammunition, cash, body armor, extensive digital devices and a wide array of ALKN paraphernalia.\u00a0 In conducting this investigation, Alade directly supported the department\u2019s mission by ensuring public safety against domestic and foreign threats, as well as providing leadership in preventing and controlling crime.",

            "article_text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 A superseding indictment was returned yesterday in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, charging HuaweiTechnologies Co., Ltd. (Huawei), the world\u2019s largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer, and two U.S. subsidiaries with conspiracy to violate the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).\n\nThe 16-count superseding indictment also adds a charge of conspiracy to steal trade secrets stemming from the China-based company\u2019s alleged long-running practice of using fraud and deception to misappropriate sophisticated technology from U.S. counterparts.\n\nThe indicted defendants include Huawei and four official and unofficial subsidiaries \u2014 Huawei Device Co., Ltd. (Huawei Device), Huawei Device USA Inc. (Huawei USA), Futurewei Technologies, Inc. (Futurewei) and Skycom Tech Co. Ltd. (Skycom) \u2014 as well as Huawei\u2019s Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Wanzhou Meng (Meng).[1]The new superseding indictment also contains the charges from the prior superseding indictment, which was unsealed in January 2019.\n\nRichard P. Donoghue, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York; Brian A. Benczkowski, Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division; John C. Demers, Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division; and Christopher A. Wray, Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), announced the charges.\n\nMr. Donoghue thanked the FBI, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Export Enforcement (OEE) and the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) agents who are investigating this case for their tireless work and dedication.\n\nAs revealed by the government\u2019s independent investigation and review of court filings, the new charges in this case relate to the alleged decades-long efforts by Huawei, and several of its subsidiaries, both in the U.S. and in the People\u2019s Republic of China, to misappropriate intellectual property, including from six U.S. technology companies, in an effort to grow and operate Huawei\u2019s business.\u00a0 The misappropriated intellectual property included trade secret information and copyrighted works, such as source code and user manuals for internet routers, antenna technology and robot testing technology.\u00a0 Huawei, Huawei USA and Futurewei agreed to reinvest the proceeds of this alleged racketeering activity in Huawei\u2019s worldwide business, including in the United States.\n\nThe means and methods of the alleged misappropriation included entering into confidentiality agreements with the owners of the intellectual property and then violating the terms of the agreements by misappropriating the intellectual property for the defendants\u2019 own commercial use, recruiting employees of other companies and directing them to misappropriate their former employers\u2019 intellectual property, and using proxies such as professors working at research institutions to obtain and provide the technology to the defendants.\u00a0 As part of the scheme, Huawei allegedly launched a policy instituting a bonus program to reward employees who obtained confidential information from competitors.\u00a0 The policy made clear that employees who provided valuable information were to be financially rewarded.\n\nHuawei\u2019s efforts to steal trade secrets and other sophisticated U.S. technology were successful.\u00a0 Through the methods of deception described above, the defendants obtained nonpublic intellectual property relating to internet router source code, cellular antenna technology and robotics.\u00a0 As a consequence of its campaign to steal this technology and intellectual property, Huawei was able to drastically cut its research and development costs and associated delays, giving the company a significant and unfair competitive advantage.\n\nWhen confronted with evidence of wrongdoing, the defendants allegedly made repeated misstatements to U.S. officials, including FBI agents and representatives from the U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, regarding their efforts to misappropriate trade secrets.\u00a0 Similarly, the defendants engaged in obstructive conduct to minimize litigation risk and the potential for criminal investigations, including the very investigation that led to this prosecution.\n\nThe superseding indictment also includes new allegations about Huawei and its subsidiaries\u2019 involvement in business and technology projects in countries subject to U.S., E.U. and/or U.N. sanctions, such as Iran and North Korea \u2013 as well as the company\u2019s efforts to conceal the full scope of that involvement.\u00a0 The defendants\u2019 activities, which included arranging for shipment of Huawei goods and services to end users in sanctioned countries, were typically conducted through local affiliates in the sanctioned countries.\u00a0 Reflecting the inherent sensitivity of conducting business in jurisdictions subject to sanctions, internal Huawei documents allegedly referred to such jurisdictions with code names.\u00a0 For example, the code \u201cA2\u201d referred to Iran, and \u201cA9\u201d referred to North Korea.\n\nHuawei employees also allegedly lied about Huawei\u2019s relationship to Skycom, falsely asserting it was not a subsidiary of Huawei.\u00a0 The company further claimed that Huawei had only limited operations in Iran and that Huawei did not violate U.S. or other laws or regulations related to Iran.\u00a0 In fact, the indictment alleges Skycom was Huawei\u2019s unofficial subsidiary that, among other services, assisted the Government of Iran in performing domestic surveillance, including during the demonstrations in Tehran in 2009.\n\nThe charges in the superseding indictment are allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.\n\nThe government\u2019s investigation is ongoing.\u00a0 Individuals with knowledge of misconduct by Huawei, its subsidiaries, employees or agents should contact the FBI\u2019s New York Field Office at 1-800-CALL-FBI.\n\nThe investigation is being jointly conducted by the FBI\u2019s New York Field Office, HSI\u2019s New York Field Office, OEE\u2019s New York Field Office and DCIS\u2019s Southwest and Northeast Field Offices.\u00a0 Agents from the FBI, HSI and OEE offices in Dallas provided significant support and assistance.\u00a0 The government\u2019s case is being handled by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of New York, the Justice Department Criminal Division\u2019s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS) and the Justice Department National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section (CES).\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorneys Alexander A. Solomon, Julia Nestor, David K. Kessler and Sarah Evans, MLARS Trial Attorneys Laura Billings and Christian Nauvel and CES Trial Attorneys Thea D. R. Kendler and David Lim are in charge of the prosecution, with assistance provided by Assistant U.S. Attorney Brendan G. King of the Civil Division of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of New York and Trial Attorneys Margaret O\u2019Malley and John Riesenberg of DOJ\u2019s Office of International Affairs.\u00a0 Additional Criminal Division and National Security Division Trial Attorneys and Assistant U.S. Attorneys within U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices for the Northern District of Texas, the Northern District of Illinois, the Eastern District of Texas, the Western District of Washington and the Northern District of California have provided valuable assistance with various aspects of this investigation.\n\nThe Defendants:\n\nHuaweiTechnologies Co. Ltd.\n\nHuawei Device Co., Ltd.\n\nHuawei Device USA Inc.\n\nFuturewei Technologies, Inc.\n\nSkycom Tech Co. Ltd.\n\nE.D.N.Y. Docket No. 18-CR-457 (AMD)\n\n\n\n[1]The superseding indictment charges other individuals who have not yet been apprehended and whose names will not be publicly released at this time.",

Gathe, Jr. announced that U.S. District Judge John W. deGravelles sentenced Parviz Sharifrazi, age 70, of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to 24 months in federal prison following his convictions for mail fraud and money laundering.\u00a0 The Court further sentenced Sharifrazi to serve one year of supervised release following his term of imprisonment.\n\nToday\u2019s sentencing resulted from a federal criminal investigation that began years ago.\u00a0 In 2008 and 2009, Sharifrazi was working as an associate professor at Southern University (\u201cSouthern\u201d) and trying to raise money for an unrelated business venture in Iran.\u00a0 Beginning in 2008, he and a co-defendant, who was working as the Information Technologies (IT) Director at Southern\u2019s College of Engineering, conceived a scheme to defraud Southern by submitting fraudulent equipment quotes in the names of fictitious vendors and causing Southern to approve the quotes, while concealing their involvement in the scheme.\n\nIn furtherance of the scheme, Sharifrazi\u2019s co-defendant would create fraudulent computer equipment purchase requests, generate fraudulent quotes for the equipment in the name of shell companies that he and Sharifrazi had created, and then submit the fraudulent quotes to Southern\u2019s purchasing department and cause them to be approved.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Sharifrazi caused other individuals to register for mail forwarding services at private mail facilities in Las Vegas, Nevada, Beaverton, Oregon, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Sharifrazi used these mailboxes to deceive Southern.\u00a0 Through their use of shell companies, out-of-state mailing addresses, and other means, Sharifrazi and his co-defendant were able to conceal the fraudulent nature of the purchase requests and the quotes and hide the fact that they were profiting from the scheme.\n\nBetween April and November 2008, Sharifrazi and his co-defendant caused Southern to issue 14 checks totaling more than $150,000 to their shell companies and to mail the checks to the out-of-state mailboxes that they had opened.\u00a0 Then, as the defendants gained control of the funds, Sharifrazi would conduct additional monetary transactions and launder the proceeds of the scheme by, for instance, transferring proceeds from the scheme into another bank account that he and a family member in the name of a Denham Springs restaurant.\n\nSharifrazi was indicted in 2011.\u00a0 By this time, he had left Southern and was living in Iran.\u00a0 After being contacted by federal law enforcement agents, and knowing that the court had issued a warrant for his arrest, the defendant was a fugitive for more than a decade, living in Iran for many years and then moving to Turkey.\u00a0 In mid-2021, the defendant met with agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Turkey and agreed to return to the United States to accept responsibility for his crimes.\u00a0 Earlier this year, Sharifrazi pled guilty to mail fraud and money laundering and admitted his involvement in the fraudulent scheme described above.\n\nSharifrazi\u2019s co-defendant pled guilty in 2010 and has fully served his sentence, which included both a term of imprisonment and an order to pay restitution to Southern University.\n\nU.S. Attorney Gathe stated, \u201cThis prosecution demonstrates that neither time nor distance shall deter the federal government and our partners from obtaining justice. \u00a0I want to thank our prosecutors and the federal and state law enforcement agencies who made this result possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis sentencing demonstrates the steadfast work of the FBI and our partners in bringing to justice individuals like former Southern University Professor Parviz Sharifraz, who engaged in fraudulent schemes that grossly impacted Southern University,\u201d said FBI Special Agent in Charge Douglas A. Williams, Jr. \u00a0\u201cWe thank our partners from the U.S. Attorney's Office Middle District of Louisiana, Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation, the Louisiana Office of Inspector General, and the U.S. Department of Education Office of Inspector General for their collaborative efforts to identify, investigate, and bring to justice criminals who seek to harm American universities through fraud and deceit.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday's sentencing exemplifies the patience and long arm of the law in its pursuit of financial fraud and money laundering violations,\u201d said James E. Dorsey, Special Agent in Charge of IRS-CI\u2019s Atlanta Field Office.\u00a0 \u201cMr. Parviz Shafrazi perpetuated an elaborate scheme driven by his insatiable greed and a blatant disregard for the tremendous damage inflicted on Southern University and its students.\u00a0 Be assured that IRS Criminal Investigation, together with our federal partners, will hold those who engage in similar behavior fully accountable.\u201d\n\nLouisiana Inspector General Stephen Street commented, \u201cJustice for Mr. Sharifrazi has been delayed for well over a decade because of his deliberate choice to remain out of the country rather than face the music for his crimes.\u00a0 Today\u2019s sentencing at last brings closure and consequences for a carefully devised criminal scheme to defraud the institution of higher learning at which Mr. Sharifrazi was employed.\u00a0 It also hopefully sends the message that the wheels of justice may sometimes turn slowly, but they do indeed turn.\u00a0 No matter how long it may take, the Louisiana OIG will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to relentlessly pursue public corruption in all of its forms.\u201d\u00a0 Street added, \u201cI want to commend United States Attorney Ron Gathe and his staff, as well as our partners at the FBI, IRS, and Department of Education OIG for another successful outcome.\u201d\n\nThis matter was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation, the Louisiana Office of Inspector General, and the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Office of Inspector General, with critical assistance from the U.S. Marshal\u2019s Service.\u00a0 The case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Alan A. Stevens, who also serves as Senior Litigation Counsel for the United States Attorney\u2019s Office.",

            "article_text": "United States Attorney Richard W. Moore of the Southern District of Alabama, announces that Colonel Saad Taha Ahmed Yousif al-Qaysy was sentenced to three years of probation and stripped of his United States citizenship after being convicted of lying to obtain his citizenship.\n\nAhmed was born in Baghdad, Iraq in 1958.\u00a0 He earned a degree in electrical engineering in the early 1980s, and then was conscripted into the Iraqi Army in 1983 during the Iran-Iraq War.\u00a0\u00a0 After his mandatory service was complete in 1985, Ahmed joined the Iraqi Army as a First Lieutenant in the al-Quds Reconnaissance Brigade.\u00a0 Thereafter, the Army sent Ahmed to a university in Yugoslavia to gain Serbian and Russian language skills.\n\nAfter returning to Iraq, Ahmed rose up the ranks as an Iraqi Army officer.\u00a0 He served as a Captain in the 10th Armored Division during the Invasion of Kuwait and the Gulf War, and as a Colonel during the 2003 Iraq War.\u00a0 Ahmed\u2019s twenty-year military career ended when Coalition Forces disbanded the Iraqi Army on May 23, 2003.\u00a0 During his final two years in the Iraqi Army, Ahmed was assigned to two public hospitals as a senior military officer.\u00a0 This is significant because the Saddam Hussein regime used public hospitals at this time for dual purposes \u2014 treatment centers for the sick and injured, and torture sites for political prisoners and military deserters.\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the Iraqi Army, Ahmed claimed that he worked for an American military contractor in Abu Ghraib, Iraq.\u00a0 However, the military contractor has no record of Ahmed.\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, a letter of recommendation purportedly from Ahmed\u2019s direct supervisor at the military contractor, which was later submitted to U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services, had been forged.\n\nAfter Ahmed\u2019s brother and nephew were killed in sectarian violence in 2006, Ahmed fled from the Baghdad region to northern Iraq and then to Giza, Egypt.\u00a0 While in Egypt, Ahmed and other former senior Iraqi military officers discussed the need to hide the true nature and extent of their military careers in order to be admitted as refugees into the United States.\n\nIn 2009, Ahmed applied for refugee status via the United States Refugee Admissions Program.\u00a0 In his application, Ahmed falsely claimed that he only served in the Iraqi Army for a brief period in the 1980s as a conscript during the Iran-Iraq War.\u00a0 Ahmed\u2019s refugee application was approved in January 2010, and he was admitted into the United States as a refugee fleeing the war in Iraq.\u00a0 Thereafter, Ahmed was approved for refugee resettlement and placed in Mobile, Alabama.In 2011, Ahmed adjusted his status from refugee to legal permanent resident.\u00a0\u00a0 Once again, Ahmed lied about the nature and extent of his military service, and falsely claimed that he was merely an electrical engineer working on a base in Baghdad from 1987 to 1991.\u00a0 Ahmed further claimed that his military service ended just prior to the Invasion of Kuwait, when, in fact, he was a Captain in the 10th Armored Division during the invasion.\n\nFinally, in April 2015, Ahmed applied for United States citizenship.\u00a0 In his citizenship application, Ahmed perpetuated the false narrative that he was simply an electrical engineer forced to join the Iraqi Army during the Iran-Iraq War.\u00a0 Ahmed was officially sworn in as a United States citizen on July 20, 2015 in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nIn November 2019, Ahmed pleaded guilty in the Southern District of Alabama to knowingly and intentionally procuring United States citizenship through fraudulent means, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1425(a).\u00a0 By statute, being convicted of this offense results in the denaturalization of the defendant at the time of sentencing.\n\nFollowing his sentencing and denaturalization on February 21, 2020, Ahmed was taken into custody by immigration officials.\u00a0 An Immigration Judge will now determine whether Ahmed will lose his status as a legal permanent resident, and whether he will be deported to Iraq.\n\nThis matter was investigated by FBI-Mobile\u2019s Joint Terrorism Task Force, and was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Christopher Bodnar.",

            "article_text": "The Justice Department today announced criminal charges in five cases from four U.S. Attorney\u2019s offices in connection with the multi-agency Disruptive Technology Strike Force (Strike Force).\n\nThe Strike Force is co-led by the Departments of Justice and Commerce to counter efforts by hostile nation states to illicitly acquire sensitive U.S. technology to advance their authoritarian regimes and facilitate human rights abuses. Launched in February 2023, the Strike Force\u2019s work has led to the unsealing of charges against 34 defendants in 24 cases involving alleged export control violations, smuggling, theft of trade secrets, and other charges by actors connected to Russia, China, and Iran.\n\nThe cases announced today took place over the course of multiple weeks, culminating in the arrest today of a Russian national allegedly seeking to illegally export electronics for use in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to Russia. The other cases also cover spearfishing of U.S-based scientists by an employee of a state-owned Chinese defense company and the smuggling of laser welding machines used in nuclear munition production to Russia.\n\n\u201cThe prosecutions of these cases under the Disruptive Technology Strike Force reflects the joint efforts of five agencies across the government focused on the shared goal of stopping the transfer of sensitive, cutting-edge technologies to Iran, China, and Russia,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department's National Security Division. \u201cThe Justice Department, through the work of the Strike Force, will continue to do all we can to prevent advanced technologies from falling into the hands of our adversaries and protect our national security.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe launched the Disruptive Technology Strike Force a year and half ago to advance the vital mission of safeguarding U.S. technology,\u201d said Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement Matthew S. Axelrod of the U.S. Department of Commerce. \u201cAs today\u2019s announcements make clear, our efforts to protect sensitive U.S. technologies \u2013 which to date have yielded 24 publicly charged criminal cases, millions of dollars in administrative penalties, and multiple Entity List additions \u2013 remain relentless and unyielding.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that the threats we face today are more complex and severe than ever before,\u201d\u00a0said Executive Assistant Director Robert Wells of the FBI\u2019s National Security Branch.\u00a0\u201cThe best way \u2013 and the only way \u2013 we can stay ahead of current and emerging threats is by working together. With these indictments, the Disruptive Technology Strike Force is an excellent example of the power of partnerships in practice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose who facilitate the illegal proliferation of sensitive technologies and material to hostile nations and terrorist groups pose a serious threat to the safety and security of the United States,\u201d said Executive Associate Director Katrina W. Berger of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). \u201cHSI is committed to working with our partners to disrupt and dismantle the criminal networks that aid and abed U.S. adversaries.\u201d\n\n\u201cDisrupting the efforts of foreign nations, international criminal organizations, and other potentially hostile entities that seek to illegally obtain sensitive DoD technology and weapon systems that could potentially be used against our military forces remains a top priority of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the criminal investigative arm of Department of Defense (DoD) Office of Inspector General,\u201d said Inspector General Robert P. Storch of DoD. \u201cWe will continue to work with the Justice Department and our strike force partners to thwart the efforts of criminal elements whose activities threaten the security of the United States.\u201d\n\nUnited States v. Postovoy (District of Columbia)\n\nA federal grand jury returned a seven-countindictmentcharging Denis Postovoy, a Russian citizen living in the United States, with conspiring to violate the Export Control Reform Act, commit smuggling, commit money laundering and defraud the United States. HSI arrested Postovoy this morning in Sarasota, Florida.\n\nAccording to court documents, beginning in at least February 2022, following Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Postovoy procured and illicitly exported from the United States to Russia microelectronic components with military applications. The exported microelectronics can be used in UAVs or drones. Through a web of companies that he owns or operates in Russia, Hong Kong, and elsewhere, Postovoy and individuals in his network purchased the microelectronics from U.S.-based distributors and exported them to Russia without the required licenses from the Department of Commerce.\n\nAs alleged, Postovoy\u2019s companies included WowCube HK Limited, JST Group Hong Kong, Jove HK Limited, all based in Hong Kong, and the Vector Group in Russia. Postovoy repeatedly concealed and misstated the true end users and end destinations of the microelectronics by submitting false information on export-related documents. He transshipped items that were ultimately destined for Russia through intermediary destinations, including Hong Kong, Switzerland and elsewhere, and received payments in U.S. dollars from foreign bank accounts. His companies transferred funds for the purchase and shipment of the goods through bank accounts in Hong Kong, Russia, and elsewhere to bank accounts in the United States, including bank accounts maintained by the U.S. suppliers of microelectronics and other sensitive technologies.\n\nHSI is investigating the case.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Stuart Allen for the District of Columbia and Trial Attorney Sean Heiden of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting the case.\n\nUnited States v. Song Wu (Northern District of Georgia)\n\nToday, a federal court in Atlanta, unsealed anindictmentcharging Chinese national, Song Wu, 39, with wire fraud and aggravated identity theft arising from his efforts to fraudulently obtain computer software and source code created by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), research universities, and private companies. Song remains at large.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Song allegedly engaged in a multi-year \u201cspear phishing\u201d email campaign in which he created email accounts to impersonate U.S.-based researchers and engineers and then used those imposter accounts to obtain specialized restricted or proprietary software used for aerospace engineering and computational fluid dynamics. This specialized software could be used for industrial and military applications, such as development of advanced tactical missiles and aerodynamic design and assessment of weapons.\n\nIn executing the scheme, Song allegedly sent spear phishing emails to individuals employed in positions with the U.S. government, including NASA, the Air Force, Navy, and Army, and the Federal Aviation Administration. Song also sent spear phishing emails to individuals employed in positions with major research universities in Georgia, Michigan, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Ohio, and with private sector companies that work in the aerospace field. Song\u2019s spear phishing emails appeared to the targeted victims as having been sent by a colleague, associate, friend, or other person in the research or engineering community. His emails requested that the targeted victim send or make available source code or software to which Song believed the targeted victim had access.\n\nAccording to the indictment, while conducting this spear phishing campaign, Song was employed as an engineer at Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), a Chinese state-owned aerospace and defense conglomerate headquartered in Beijing. AVIC manufactures civilian and military aircrafts and is one of the largest defense contractors in the world.\n\nIn total, Song is charged with 14 counts of wire fraud and 14 counts of aggravated identity theft. If convicted, Song faces a maximum statutory penalty of 20 years in prison for each count of wire fraud. Song also faces a mandatory, two-year consecutive penalty in prison for aggravated identity theft. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nThe FBI and the NASA\u2019s Office of Inspector General are investigating the case.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Samir Kaushal for the Northern District of Georgia and Trial Attorney Tanner Kroeger of the National Security Division's Cyber Section are prosecuting the case with assistance from the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.\n\nUnited States v. Teslenko (District of Massachusetts)\n\nMassachusetts resident, Samer Bhambhani, 55, and Russian national, Maksim Teslenko, 35, have beenchargedwith smuggling and one count of conspiracy to violate and evade export controls, commit smuggling, and defraud the United States. Bhambhani was arrested on Sept. 9 and was released on conditions following an initial appearance in federal court in Boston. Teslenko remains at large overseas.\n\nIt is alleged that from in or around 2015 through at least 2021, Bhambhani and Teslenko conspired to export laser welding machines from Bhambhani\u2019s employer in the United States to the Ural Electromechanical Plant (UEMZ) in Yekaterinburg, Russia, while falsifying the export documentation submitted to the U.S. government in order to conceal the fact that the UEMZ was the true end user of the machines. The UEMZ is a subsidiary of Rosatom, a Russian state corporation headquartered in Moscow, that oversaw Russia\u2019s civilian and military nuclear program. According to the indictment, Teslenko knew that the laser welding machines were intended for the portion of the UEMZ involving the Russian nuclear weapons program.\n\nThe charge of smuggling provides for a sentence of up to 10 years in prison, three years supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000. The charge of conspiracy provides for a sentence of up to five years in prison, three years supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorneys Timothy H. Kistner and Laura S. Kaplan for the District of Massachusetts and Trial Attorney Sean O\u2019Dowd of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting the case.\n\nUnited States v. Goodarzi (Southern District of Texas)\n\nGholam Reza Goodarzi, also known as Ron Goodarzi, 76, a dual U.S. and Iranian citizen who resides in Porter, Texas, was arrested at the George Bush International Airport on Aug. 30 based on a criminal complaint alleging he smuggled parts and components used in the production of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), as well as other manned aircraft, from the United States to Iran.\n\nAccording to court documents, from December 1, 2020, through July 5, Goodarzi illegally exported aircraft-related parts, in addition to oil and drilling components, to Iran. As alleged, Goodarzi purchased U.S.-origin aircraft components from U.S.-based suppliers and then exported them to Iran \u2013 typically through Dubai, UAE. He also traveled to and from Iran multiple times per year and concealed aircraft parts and other items in his checked luggage. Goodarzi exchanged multiple emails with suppliers and customers, acknowledging that parts could not be shipped to Iran because of sanctions.\n\nThe complaint alleges that on several occasions, authorities searched Goodarzi\u2019s luggage and found numerous aircraft parts and components hidden within articles of clothing. Some of the items had characteristics consistent with parts for the production of UAVs, as well as parts with electrical motor and generator applications. Goodarzi does not have the required licenses to export such items to sanctioned countries, including Iran, according to the complaint.\n\nThe FBI, with assistance from and Customs and Border Protection, is investigating the case.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Heather Winter for the Southern District of Texas and Trial Attorney Christopher Cook of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting the case.\n\nUnited States v. Nader (District of Columbia)\n\nU.S.-Iranian nationalJeffrey Chance Nader, 66, of Arcadia, California, was arrested on Aug. 13, 2024, based on an indictment charging him with crimes related to the procurement of U.S.-manufactured aircraft components, including components used on military aircraft, in violation of U.S. economic sanctions and other federal laws.\n\nAccording to the indictment, beginning at least in 2023, Nader and others conspired to purchase and export \u2013 and attempted to export \u2013 from the United States to Iran four types of aircraft components, totaling nearly three dozen individual pieces. Some of these components are for use on military aircraft operated by Iran\u2019s armed forces, including the F-4 fighter jet.\n\nNader, acting on purchase orders he received from customers in Iran, would coordinate the purchase of relevant aircraft components with business associates in Iran, by which they would reach out to U.S.-based suppliers of such components. In several instances, Nader identified himself and his company, California-based Pro Aero Capital, to these U.S.-based suppliers as the end-user of these items. Victim companies in this procurement scheme were located across the United States.\n\nOnce the aircraft components were obtained, Nader attempted to export the items on multiple separate occasions. The items were then transshipped to the ultimate customer in Iran. None of the transactions discussed in the indictment were successfully exported; they were detained on export by a Special Agent with the Department of Commerce.\n\nThis case is being investigated by the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office and the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security. Significant assistance was provided by the FBI\u2019s Los Angeles Field Office.\n\nThe case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Steven B. Wasserman for the District of Columbia and Trial Attorney Sean Heiden of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section. Significant assistance was provided by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California.\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\n\nToday\u2019s actions were coordinated through the Justice and Commerce Departments\u2019 Disruptive Technology Strike Force. The Disruptive Technology Strike Force is an interagency law enforcement strike force co-led by the Departments of Justice and Commerce designed to target illicit actors, protect supply chains and prevent critical technology from being acquired by authoritarian regimes and hostile nation states.\u00a0 ThePostovoyandTeslenkoinvestigations were also coordinated through the Justice Department\u2019s Task Force KleptoCapture, an interagency law enforcement task force dedicated to enforcing sanctions, export controls and economic countermeasures imposed in response to Russia\u2019s unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine.\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\n\nAlso today, the Department is announcing the unsealing of anindictmentin Chicago, Illinois, charging Chinese national Jia Wei with unlawfully accessing the computer network of a U.S. communications company to steal proprietary information for the benefit of the China-based entities.\n\nAs alleged, Wei was a member of the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA), the military of the People\u2019s Republic of China, and assigned to a PLA unit tasked with obtaining communications and information of third parties through computer hacking. In March 2017, Wei and his co-conspirators accessed the U.S. company\u2019s network without authorization approximately two days after the U.S. company filed a civil action against a China-based competitor for theft of communication-device trade secrets. Through this unauthorized access, Wei and his co-conspirators stole U.S. company documents relating to, among other things, the company\u2019s civilian and military communication devices, product development, testing plans, internal product evaluations and commercial information about competitors. These documents pertained to some of the same technology and information that the China-based competitor stole from the U.S. company, as alleged in the civil action. In addition, Wei and his co-conspirators stole documents from the U.S. company discussing the China-based competitor.\n\nDuring his unauthorized access, Wei and his co-conspirators attempted to install malicious software designed to provide persistent unauthorized access to the U.S. company\u2019s network. Wei\u2019s unauthorized access continued until approximately late May 2017.\n\nThe six-count indictment, returned in March 2022, charges Wei with wire fraud, conspiracy to commit computer intrusions, computer intrusions and aggravated identity theft. A warrant for his arrest has been issued. If convicted, Wei faces a maximum statutory penalty of 20 years in prison for each wire fraud count, five years in prison for each of the conspiracy and computer intrusion counts, and a mandatory, two-year consecutive penalty in prison for each aggravated identity theft count. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nThe FBI Chicago Field Office is investigating the case.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorneys Melody Wells, Steven Dollear and Thomas Peabody for the Northern District of Illinois and Trial Attorney Brett Reynolds of the National Security Division are prosecuting the case. Significant assistance was provided by the National Security Division\u2019s National Security Cyber Section.\n\nAn indictment, complaint or criminal information is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.\n\nNote:This press release was updated on Sept. 16, 2024, to include two additional cases.",

            "article_text": "A criminal complaint was unsealed today in federal court in Brooklyn charging Kaveh Lotfolah Afrasiabi, also known as Lotfolah Kaveh Afrasiabi, with acting and conspiring to act as an unregistered agent of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, in violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).\u00a0 Afrasiabi was arrested yesterday at his home in Watertown, Massachusetts, and will make his initial appearance this morning in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts, before U.S. Magistrate Judge Jennifer C. Boal.\n\nJohn C. Demers, Assistant Attorney General for National Security; Seth D. DuCharme, Acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York; William F. Sweeney, Jr., Assistant Director in Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation, New York Field Office (FBI); and Joseph Bonavolonta, Special Agent in Charge, FBI, Boston Field Office, announced the arrest and charges.\n\n\u201cFor over a decade, Kaveh Afrasiabi pitched himself to Congress, journalists, and the American public as a neutral and objective expert on Iran,\u201d said John C. Demers, Assistant Attorney General for National Security. \u00a0\u201cHowever, all the while, Afrasiabi was actually a secret employee of the Government of Iran and the Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations (IMUN) who was being paid to spread their propaganda.\u00a0 In doing so, he intentionally avoided registering with the Department of Justice as the Foreign Agents Registration Act required.\u00a0 He likewise evaded his obligation to disclose who was sponsoring his views.\u00a0 We now begin to hold him responsible for those deeds.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfrasiabi allegedly sought to influence the American public and American policymakers for the benefit of his employer, the Iranian government, by disguising propaganda as objective policy analysis and expertise,\u201d said Acting U.S. Attorney DuCharme.\u00a0 \u201cThis Office is committed to the robust enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which provides the American people the tools they need to evaluate opinions and arguments in the marketplace of ideas by requiring foreign agents to declare their paymasters.\u00a0 Those, like the defendant, who conceal the full extent of their work for a foreign government when the law requires disclosure will face consequences for their actions.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyone working to advance the agenda of a foreign government within the United States is required by law to register as an agent of that country,\u201d said FBI Assistant Director in Charge Sweeney.\u00a0 \u201cMr. Afrasiabi never disclosed to a congressman, journalists or others who hold roles of influence in our country that he was being paid by the Iranian government to paint an untruthfully positive picture of the nation.\u00a0 Our laws are designed to create transparency in foreign relations, and they are not arbitrary or malleable.\u00a0 As today's action demonstrates, we will fully enforce them to protect our national security.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur arrest of Kaveh Afrasiabi makes it clear that the United States is not going to allow undeclared agents of Iran to operate in our country unchecked.\u00a0 For more than a decade, Mr. Afrasiabi was allegedly paid, directed, and controlled by the Government of Iran to lobby U.S. government officials, including a congressman; and to create and disseminate information favorable to the Iranian government,\u201d said FBI Special Agent in Charge Bonavolonta.\u00a0 \u201cThe FBI will continue to do everything it can to uncover these hidden efforts and hold accountable those who work for our adversaries to the detriment of our national security.\u201d\n\nAccording to the complaint, Afrasiabi is a citizen of the Islamic Republic of Iran and a lawful permanent resident of the United States.\u00a0 Afrasiabi holds a PhD, and frequently publishes books and articles, and appears on English-language television programs discussing foreign relations matters, particularly Iran\u2019s relations with the United States.\u00a0 Afrasiabi has identified or portrayed himself as a political scientist, a former political science professor or as an expert on foreign affairs.\n\nSince at least 2007 to the present, Afrasiabi has also been secretly employed by the Iranian government and paid by Iranian diplomats assigned to the Permanent Mission of the IMUN.\u00a0 Afrasiabi has been paid approximately $265,000 in checks drawn on the IMUN\u2019s official bank accounts since 2007, and has received health insurance through the IMUN\u2019s employee health benefit plans since at least 2011.\n\nIn the course of his employment by the Iranian government, Afrasiabi has lobbied a U.S. congressman and the U.S. Department of State to advocate for policies favorable to Iran, counseled Iranian diplomats concerning U.S. foreign policy, made television appearances to advocate for the Iranian government\u2019s views on world events, and authored articles and opinion pieces espousing the Iranian government\u2019s position on various matters of foreign policy.\u00a0 Afrasiabi has long known that FARA requires agents of foreign principals to register with the U.S. Department of Justice and has discussed information obtained from FARA disclosures with others.\u00a0 Nevertheless, Afrasiabi did not register as an agent of the Government of Iran.\n\nFor example, in January 2020, Afrasiabi emailed Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister and Permanent Representative to the United Nations with advice for \u201cretaliation\u201d for the U.S. military airstrike that killed Major General Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Quds Force, the external operations arm of the Iranian government\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, proposing that the Iranian government \u201cend all inspections and end all information on Iran\u2019s nuclear activities pending a [United Nations Security Council] condemnation of [the United States\u2019] illegal crime.\u201d\u00a0 Afrasiabi claimed that such a move would, among other things, \u201cstrike fear in the heart of [the] enemy.\u201d\n\nAfrasiabi has admitted in his own communications that his extensive body of published works and television appearances, in which he has consistently advocated perspectives and policy positions favored by the Iranian government, has been attributable to the funding he receives from the Iranian government.\u00a0 For example, in a July 28, 2020, email to Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister, Afrasiabi included \u201clinks for many of [his] works, including books, hundreds of articles in international newspapers and academic journals,\u201d telling Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister, \u201cWithout support none of this would have been possible! This has been a very productive relationship spanning decades that ought not to be interrupted.\u201d\n\nThe charges in the complaint are allegations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\u00a0 If convicted of both charged offenses, Afrasiabi faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.\n\nThe government\u2019s case is being handled by the Office\u2019s National Security and Cybercrime Section.\u00a0 Assistant U.S. Attorneys Ian C. Richardson and Michael T. Keilty are in charge of the prosecution, with assistance from Trial Attorney David C. Recker of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.",

            "article_text": "Shakeri Was Tasked by Iranian Regime with Surveilling and Plotting to Assassinate President-Elect Donald J. Trump\n\nNote:View the criminal complaint here.\n\nFarhad Shakeri, 51, of Iran; Carlisle Rivera, also known as Pop, 49, of Brooklyn, New York; and Jonathon Loadholt, 36, of Staten Island, New York, were charged today in a criminal complaint in connection with their alleged involvement in a plot to murder a U.S. citizen of Iranian origin in New York. Rivera was arrested in Brooklyn, New York, and Loadholt was arrested in Staten Island, New York, yesterday. Shakeri remains at large and is believed to reside in Iran. Rivera and Loadholt made their initial appearance in the Southern District of New York yesterday and were ordered detained pending trial.\n\n\u201cThere are few actors in the world that pose as grave a threat to the national security of the United States as does Iran,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \u201cThe Justice Department has charged an asset of the Iranian regime who was tasked by the regime to direct a network of criminal associates to further Iran\u2019s assassination plots against its targets, including President-elect Donald Trump. We have also charged and arrested two individuals who we allege were recruited as part of that network to silence and kill, on U.S. soil, an American journalist who has been a prominent critic of the regime.\u00a0We will not stand for the Iranian regime\u2019s attempts to endanger the American people and America\u2019s national security.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe charges announced today expose Iran's continued brazen attempts to target U.S. citizens, including President-elect Donald Trump, other government leaders and dissidents who criticize the regime in Tehran,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \u201cThe Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps \u2014 a designated foreign terrorist organization \u2014 has been conspiring with criminals and hitmen to target and gun down Americans on U.S. soil and that simply won\u2019t be tolerated. Thanks to the hard work of the FBI, their deadly schemes were disrupted.\u00a0\u00a0We're committed to using the full resources of the FBI to protect our citizens from Iran or any other adversary who targets Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cActors directed by the Government of Iran continue to target our citizens, including President-elect Trump, on U.S. soil and abroad.\u00a0This has to stop,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York.\u00a0\u201cToday\u2019s charges are another message to those who continue in their efforts \u2013 we will remain unrelenting in our pursuit of bad actors, no matter where they reside, and will stop at nothing to bring to justice those who harm our safety and security.\u00a0I want to thank the career prosecutors of this office and our law enforcement partners for their ongoing work in this and related investigations.\u00a0 They are truly the best of the best and work tirelessly to keep our country safe.\u201d\n\nAccording to the complaint and other public statements and filings, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran (the Government of Iran) is actively targeting nationals of the United States and its allies living in countries around the world for attacks, including assault, kidnapping, and murder, both to repress and silence dissidents critical of the Iranian regime and to take vengeance for the January 2020 death of then-Commander of the Islamic\u00a0 Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Qods Force (IRGC-QF), Qasem Soleimani, who was killed by a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad. The IRGC is an Iranian military and counterintelligence agency under the authority of Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader, comprised of components including an external operations force, the IRGC-QF, and has been designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. Secretary of State since April 15, 2019. The IRGC has publicly stated its desire to avenge the death of Soleimani, and, among its activities, the IRGC plots and conducts attack operations outside Iran targeting U.S. citizens residing in the United States and abroad.\n\nShakeri is an IRGC asset residing in Tehran, Iran. Shakeri immigrated to the United States as a child and was deported in or about 2008 after serving 14 years in prison for a robbery conviction. In recent months, Shakeri has used a network of criminal associates he met in prison in the United States to supply the IRGC with operatives to conduct surveillance and assassinations of IRGC targets. Two members of Shakeri\u2019s network are his co-defendants, Loadholt and Rivera. At Shakeri\u2019s instruction, Loadholt and Rivera have spent months surveilling a U.S. citizen of Iranian origin residing in the United States (Victim-1). Victim-1 is an outspoken critic of the Iranian regime and has been the target of multiple prior plots for kidnapping and/or murder directed by the Government of Iran. In exchange for Shakeri\u2019s promise of $100,000, Rivera and Loadholt repeatedly sought to locate Victim-1 for murder.\n\nDuring their efforts to locate and kill Victim-1, Shakeri, Loadholt, and Rivera shared messages about their progress and photographs relating to their scheme. For example, in or about February 2024, Rivera and Loadholt messaged about an incoming payment from Shakeri, and then traveled to Fairfield University, where Victim-1 was scheduled to appear, and took photographs on campus. In or about April, Shakeri sent Rivera a series of voice notes discussing their efforts to locate and kill Victim-1. In one voice note, Shakeri told Rivera that Victim-1 spent most of her time in particular locations of her home, and told Rivera that \u201cyou just gotta have patience \u2026 You gotta wait and have patience to catch her either going in the house or coming out, or following her out somewhere and taking care of it. Don\u2019t think about going in. In is a suicide move.\u201d On several occasions over the last several months, consistent with this instruction from Shakeri, Rivera and/or Loadholt have surveilled a location in Brooklyn that they had identified as associated with Victim-1.\n\nIn addition, according to statements made by Shakeri in recorded interviews with law enforcement agents, the IRGC has also tasked Shakeri with carrying out other assassinations against U.S. and Israeli citizens located in the United States. In particular, Shakeri has informed law enforcement that he was tasked\u00a0on Oct. 7, 2024, with providing a plan to kill President-elect Donald J. Trump. During the interview, Shakeri claimed he did not intend to propose a plan to kill Trump within the timeframe set by the IRGC. He also stated he was tasked with surveilling two Jewish American citizens residing in New York City and offered $500,000 by an IRGC official for the murder of either victim. He was also tasked with targeting Israeli tourists in Sri Lanka.\n\nShakeri, Rivera, and Loadholt have all been charged with murder-for-hire, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison; conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison; and money laundering conspiracy, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.\n\nShakeri has also been charged with conspiring to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison;\u00a0 providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison; and conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and sanctions against the Government of Iran, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. If convicted, a federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nThe FBI New York Field Office is investigating the case. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection New York Field Office and Drug Enforcement Administration New York Division assisted in the investigation.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorneys Jacob H. Gutwillig and Michael Lockard and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Julie Isaacson for the Southern District of New York, Trial Attorneys Dmitry Slavin of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterterrorism Section, and Christopher Rigali and Leslie Esbrook of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting the case.\n\nA complaint is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.",

            "article_text": "Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and Ann Calvaresi Barr, Inspector General for the U.S. Agency for International Development (\u201cUSAID\u201d), announced today the filing and settlement of a civil fraud complaint against NORWEGIAN PEOPLE\u2019S AID (\u201cNPA\u201d), a non-profit, non-governmental organization headquartered in Norway, that receives funding from USAID.\u00a0 The settlement resolves claims that NPA violated the False Claims Act (the \u201cFCA\u201d) by providing material support to Iran, Hamas, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (\u201cPFLP\u201d), and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (\u201cDFLP\u201d), contrary to federal funding requirements.\u00a0 At all times relevant to the lawsuit, Iran was included on the U.S. Department of State\u2019s list of state sponsors of terrorism (the \u201cState Sponsors of Terrorism List\u201d), and Hamas, PFLP, and DFLP were included on the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control\u2019s specially designated nationals and blocked persons list (the \u201cSDN List\u201d).\u00a0 The State Sponsors of Terrorism List includes countries that have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism, and the SDN List includes individuals and entities that support terrorism or otherwise engage in conduct antithetical to U.S. interests.\n\nOn March 30, U.S. District Court Judge Gregory H. Woods approved a settlement agreement that resolves the Government\u2019s claims against NPA.\u00a0 Under the settlement, NPA is required to pay $2.025 million to the United States (that amount is based on an analysis of NPA\u2019s ability to pay a monetary settlement), and it has revised its internal policies to ensure that it complies with applicable U.S. sanctions laws and the terms of its USAID grants.\u00a0 In addition, in connection with the settlement, NPA has admitted to and accepted responsibility for its conduct.\n\nManhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said: \u00a0\u201cFor years, Norwegian People\u2019s Aid obtained grant money from USAID by falsely representing that it had not provided, and would take reasonable steps to ensure that it did not knowingly provide, material support to prohibited parties under U.S. law.\u00a0 With this settlement, NPA is being made to pay a significant financial penalty for its conduct, and importantly, has admitted to its conduct and agreed to put proper precautions in place to ensure that it does not happen again.\u201d\n\nUSAID Inspector General Ann Calvaresi Barr said: \u00a0\u201cUSAID depends on the integrity of its contractors and grantees to effectively reduce poverty, promote economic growth and democratic values, and deliver aid in crises worldwide.\u00a0 Making false representations to secure grant funding not only violates U.S. law, it is a serious breach of trust.\u00a0 And, when false claims hide an organization\u2019s material support to designated terrorist organizations and a state sponsor of terrorism, the violation is all the more severe.\u00a0 My office makes these cases a top priority and we will continue to investigate them aggressively.\u201d\n\nAs alleged in the Government\u2019s complaint and set forth in the parties\u2019 settlement agreement, both of which have been filed in Manhattan federal court:\n\nSince at least 2012, NPA has received monetary grants from USAID to fund various projects and programs.\u00a0 As a condition of receiving those grants, NPA submitted certifications to USAID each year in which it represented that, \u201cto the best of its current knowledge, it did not provide within the previous ten years, and will take all reasonable steps to ensure that it does not and will not knowingly provide, material support or resources to any individual or entity that commits, attempts to commit, advocates, facilitates, or participates in terrorist acts . . . .\u201d\u00a0 In these annual certifications, NPA also represented that \u201c[b]efore providing any material support or resources to an individual or entity,\u201d it would (1) \u201cverify that the individual or entity does not appear . . . on the [SDN List],\u201d and (2) \u201cconsider all information about that individual or entity . . . that is reasonably available to it or of which it should be aware.\u201d\u00a0 The annual certifications defined \u201cmaterial support and resources\u201d to include \u201ctraining [and] expert advice or assistance.\u201d\n\nNotwithstanding the above-referenced certifications, NPA provided training and expert advice or assistance to Iran, as well as to Hamas, PFLP, and DFLP.\u00a0 With respect to Iran, from 2001 through 2008, NPA performed mine clearance activities in Iran that were integral to an Iranian oil development project.\u00a0 Among other things, NPA (1)\u00a0conducted risk assessments of the areas in Iran where the oil exploration and processing activities were to occur, (2) surveyed those areas for landmines and other unexploded ordnance, (3) trained members of the Iranian Army on how to conduct mine clearance activities, (4) accompanied and advised members of the Iranian Army as they conducted mine clearance activities in the relevant areas, and (5) conducted some mine clearance activities itself.\n\nWith respect to Hamas, PFLP, and DFLP, from 2012 through 2016, NPA provided representatives of those three SDN List entities with training and expert advice or assistance by funding a project called \u201cYouth of Today . . . Leaders of Tomorrow.\u201d\u00a0 Through this project, young people in the Gaza Strip, aged 15 through 28, who were affiliated with one of the project\u2019s partner political parties \u2013 which included Hamas, PFLP, and DFLP \u2013 received training aimed at making them more effective participants in the political process.\u00a0 Such training included programs intended to improve the participants\u2019 ability to organize, debate, negotiate, advocate for their positions, and resolve conflicts.\u00a0 In addition, through the Youth of Today project, NPA funded numerous workshops attended by young people in the Gaza Strip and senior officials from the partner political parties, including Hamas, PFLP, and DFLP.\u00a0 Hamas, PFLP, and DFLP used information that they obtained from these workshops to alter their behavior in order to become more attractive to youth and, thereby, benefit from increased youth support.\n\nBecause NPA provided training and expert advice or assistance to Iran (through the above-referenced oil development project), as well as to Hamas, PFLP, and DFLP (through the Youth of Today project), its certifications to USAID that, to the best of its knowledge, it had not provided and would take all reasonable steps to ensure that it did not knowingly provide material support or resources to any prohibited parties were false.\u00a0 As a result of those false certifications, NPA induced USAID to provide it with grant funding that, but for the false certifications, USAID would not have provided.\n\nAs part of the settlement, NPA admitted, acknowledged, and accepted responsibility for its conduct, including that: (1) \u201cNPA\u2019s participation in the [Iranian] oil development project was inconsistent with its Certifications to USAID\u201d; and (2) \u201c[t]he \u2018Youth of Today . . . Leaders of Tomorrow\u2019 training programs and workshops were conducted in a manner that was inconsistent with NPA\u2019s Certifications to USAID, in that they were attended by representatives of entities that were prohibited parties under U.S. law, including entities that were identified on the SDN List as prohibited parties.\u201d\n\nIn connection with the settlement, NPA has also revised its internal policies to ensure that it complies with applicable U.S. laws and the terms of any grants it receives.\u00a0 Such revisions include changes to its \u201cPolicy on Compliance with USAID Grants and U.S. Economic Sanctions Programs\u201d to provide for additional training of NPA managers and administrative staff on compliance with applicable U.S. laws and grant terms; regular audits by an external auditor of NPA\u2019s compliance with applicable U.S. laws and grant terms; and periodic reviews for purposes of making appropriate updates to relevant NPA internal policies and procedures.\u00a0 Moreover, upon request by USAID or any other U.S. agency that provides NPA with grants or any other type of funding, NPA shall provide such agency with, among other things, a written report, prepared by the external auditor, of the results of each of the above-referenced audits, and a description of any actions taken by NPA in response to such audits.\n\nIn connection with the filing of the lawsuit and settlement, the Government joined a private whistleblower lawsuit that previously had been filed under seal pursuant to the False Claims Act.\n\nThis is the second case that this Office has pursued successfully against a recipient of USAID grant funds based on allegations that it provided material support to prohibited parties under U.S. law.\u00a0 In March 2017, the Office resolved a similar case against the American University of Beirut.\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\n\nMr. Berman thanked the USAID Office of Inspector General for its investigative efforts and assistance with the case.\n\nThe case is being handled by the Office\u2019s Civil Frauds Unit.\u00a0 Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher B. Harwood is in charge of the case.",

            "article_text": "An Indictment charging Gholamreza Rafatnejad, 38; Ehsan Mohammadi, 37; Abdollah Karima, aka Vahid Karima, 39; Mostafa Sadeghi, 28; Seyed Ali Mirkarimi, 34; Mohammed Reza Sabahi, 26; Roozbeh Sabahi, 24; Abuzar Gohari Moqadam, 37; and Sajjad Tahmasebi, 30, all citizens and residents of Iran, was unsealed today.\u00a0 The defendants were each leaders, contractors, associates, hackers-for-hire or affiliates of the Mabna Institute, an Iran-based company that, since at least 2013, conducted a coordinated campaign of cyber intrusions into computer systems belonging to 144 U.S. universities, 176 universities across 21 foreign countries, 47 domestic and foreign private sector companies, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the State of Hawaii, the State of Indiana, the United Nations, and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund.\u00a0 Through the defendants\u2019 activities, the Mabna Institute stole more than 31 terabytes of academic data and intellectual property from universities, and email accounts of employees at private sector companies, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations.\u00a0 The defendants conducted many of these intrusions on behalf of the Islamic Republic of Iran\u2019s (Iran) Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), one of several entities within the government of Iran responsible for gathering intelligence, as well as other Iranian government and university clients.\u00a0 In addition to these criminal charges, today the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated the Mabna Institute and the nine defendants for sanctions for the malicious cyber-enabled activity outlined in the Indictment.\n\nThe charges were announced by Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein; Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers; U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman for the Southern District of New York; FBI Director Christopher A. Wray; Assistant Director in Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. of the FBI\u2019s New York Field Division; and Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Sigal Mandelker.\n\n\u201cThese nine Iranian nationals allegedly stole more than 31 terabytes of documents and data from more than 140 American universities, 30 American companies, five American government agencies, and also more than 176 universities in 21 foreign countries,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein.\u00a0 \u201cFor many of these intrusions, the defendants acted at the behest of the Iranian government and, specifically, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.\u00a0 The Department of Justice will aggressively investigate and prosecute hostile actors who attempt to profit from America\u2019s ideas by infiltrating our computer systems and stealing intellectual property.\u00a0 This case is important because it will disrupt the defendants\u2019 hacking operations and deter similar crimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, in one of the largest state-sponsored hacking campaigns ever prosecuted by the Department of Justice, we have unmasked criminals who normally hide behind the ones and zeros of computer code,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Berman.\u00a0 \u201cAs alleged, this massive and brazen cyber-assault on the computer systems of hundreds of universities in 22 countries and dozens of private sector companies and governmental organizations was conducted on behalf of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard.\u00a0 The hackers targeted innovations and intellectual property from our country\u2019s greatest minds.\u00a0 These defendants are now fugitives from American justice, no longer free to travel outside Iran without risk of arrest.\u00a0 The only way they will see the outside world is through their computer screens, but stripped of their greatest asset \u2013 anonymity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis investigation involved a complex threat in a dynamic landscape, but today\u2019s announcement highlights the commitment of the FBI and our partners to vigorously pursue those that threaten U.S. property and security,\u201d said Director Wray.\u00a0 \u201cToday, not only are we publicly identifying the foreign hackers who committed these malicious cyber intrusions, but we are also sending a powerful message to their backers, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran: your acts do not go unnoticed.\u00a0 We will protect our innovation, ideas and information, and we will use every tool in our toolbox to expose those who commit these cyber crimes.\u00a0 Our memory is long; we will hold them accountable under the law, no matter where they attempt to hide.\u201d\n\nAccording to the allegations contained in the Indictment unsealed today in Manhattan federal court:\n\nBackground on the Mabna Institute\n\nGholamreza Rafatnejad and Ehsan Mohammadi, the defendants, founded the Mabna Institute in approximately 2013 to assist Iranian universities and scientific and research organizations in stealing access to non-Iranian scientific resources.\u00a0 In furtherance of its mission, the Mabna Institute employed, contracted, and affiliated itself with hackers-for-hire and other contract personnel to conduct cyber intrusions to steal academic data, intellectual property, email inboxes and other proprietary data, including Abdollah Karima, aka Vahid Karima, Mostafa Sadeghi, Seyed Ali Mirkarimi, Mohammed Reza Sabahi, Roozbeh Sabahi, Abuzar Gohari Moqadam, and Sajjad Tahmasebi.\u00a0 The Mabna Institute contracted with both Iranian governmental and private entities to conduct hacking activities on their behalf, and specifically conducted the university spearphishing campaign on behalf of the IRGC.\u00a0 The Mabna Institute is located at Tehran, Sheikh Bahaii Shomali, Koucheh Dawazdeh Metri Sevom, Plak 14, Vahed 2, Code Posti 1995873351.\n\nUniversity Hacking Campaign\n\nThe Mabna Institute, through the activities of the defendants, targeted more than 100,000 accounts of professors around the world.\u00a0 They successfully compromised approximately 8,000 professor email accounts across 144 U.S.-based universities, and 176 universities located in foreign countries, including Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Kingdom.\u00a0 The campaign started in approximately 2013, continued through at least December 2017, and broadly targeted all types of academic data and intellectual property from the systems of compromised universities.\u00a0 Through the course of the conspiracy, U.S.-based universities spent more than approximately $3.4 billion to procure and access such data and intellectual property.\n\nThe members of the conspiracy used stolen account credentials to obtain unauthorized access to victim professor accounts, which they used to steal research, and other academic data and documents, including, among other things, academic journals, theses, dissertations, and electronic books.\u00a0 The defendants targeted data across all fields of research and academic disciplines, including science and technology, engineering, social sciences, medical, and other professional fields.\u00a0 The defendants stole at least approximately 31.5 terabytes of academic data and intellectual property, which they exfiltrated to servers outside the United States that were under the control of members of the conspiracy.\n\nIn addition to stealing academic data and login credentials for the benefit of the Government of Iran, the defendants also sold the stolen data through two websites, Megapaper.ir (Megapaper) and Gigapaper.ir (Gigapaper).\u00a0 Megapaper was operated by Falinoos Company, a company controlled by Abdollah Karima, aka Vahid Karima, the defendant, and Gigapaper was affiliated with Karima.\u00a0 Megapaper sold stolen academic resources to customers within Iran, including Iran-based public universities and institutions, and Gigapaper sold a service to customers within Iran whereby purchasing customers could use compromised university professor accounts to directly access the online library systems of particular U.S.-based and foreign universities.\n\nAccompanying Mitigation Efforts\n\nPrior to the unsealing of the Indictment, the FBI provided foreign law enforcement partners with detailed information regarding victims within their jurisdictions, so that victims in foreign countries could be notified and foreign partners could assist in remediation efforts.\n\nAlso, in connection with the unsealing of the Indictment, today the FBI provided private sector partners detailed information regarding the vulnerabilities targeted and the intrusion vectors used by the Mabna Institute in their campaign against private sector companies.\u00a0 This information will assist the public in its network defense and mitigation efforts.\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\n\n\n\nRafatnejad, Mohammadi, Karima, Sadeghi, Mirkarimi, Sabahi, Sabahi, Moqadam and Tahmasebi was each is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusions, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; two counts of unauthorized access of a computer, each of which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; two counts of wire fraud, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; and one count of aggravated identity theft, which carries a mandatory sentence of two years in prison.\u00a0 The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencings of the defendants will be determined by the assigned judge.\n\nMr. Rosenstein and Mr. Berman praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI, the assistance of the United Kingdom\u2019s National Crime Agency (NCA), and the support of the OFAC.\u00a0 Assistant U.S. Attorneys Timothy T. Howard, Jonathan Cohen and Richard Cooper are in charge of the prosecution, with assistance provided by Trial Attorneys Heather Alpino and Jason McCullough of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.\n\nThe charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\n\nFor the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s press release announcing corresponding sanctions clickhere.",

            "article_text": "Assistant Attorney General for National Security John P. Carlin and U.S. Attorney Deirdre M. Daly for the District of Connecticut announced that Mozaffar Khazaee, 60, formerly of Manchester, Connecticut, pleaded guilty today before U.S. District Judge Vanessa L. Bryant in Hartford to violating the Arms Export Control Act, in connection with his efforts to send to Iran sensitive, proprietary, trade secret and export controlled material relating to military jet engines for the U.S. Air Force\u2019s F35 Joint Strike Fighter program and the F-22 Raptor program, which he had stolen from defense contractors where he had previously been employed.\n\n\u201cWhile employed with U.S. defense contractors, Mozaffar Khazaee stole sensitive, proprietary and controlled technology to send it to Iran,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Daly.\u00a0 \u201cThe illegal export of our military technology compromises U.S. national security and reduces the advantages our armed forces currently possess.\u00a0\u00a0 As today\u2019s case demonstrates, we will aggressively investigate and hold accountable those who attempt to steal trade secrets and sensitive military technology from U.S. industries, whether for their own personal gain or for the benefit of foreign actors.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s guilty plea demonstrates the ongoing cooperation with our federal law enforcement partners to prevent U.S. technology from falling into the wrong hands,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Bruce Foucart of HSI Boston.\u00a0 \u201cAcross the globe, the magnitude and scope of threats facing the United States has never been greater, and that's why one of Homeland Security Investigations highest priorities is to prevent illicit procurement networks, terrorist groups and hostile nations from illegally obtaining U.S. military products and sensitive dual-use technologies.\u00a0 Homeland Security Investigations takes pride in protecting our country, and today\u2019s guilty plea is the latest example of our effective investigative efforts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis joint investigation has emphasized the need for American companies to remain vigilant against the theft of valuable and sensitive technologies,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Patricia M. Ferrick of the FBI\u2019s New Haven Division.\u00a0 \u201cAs our nation continues to lead the way in research and development, we are constantly reminded that there are those who seek to advance their own causes by stealing the hard work of others, and we owe it to ourselves and to the American public to guard against it. The FBI vigorously investigates these matters in cooperation with our law enforcement partners, both domestic and abroad.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis investigation demonstrates the dedication of the Department of Defense, Office of the Inspector General, Defense Criminal Investigative Service and our federal and military partners to ensure that critical technology is not exploited by criminals acting on behalf of governments hostile to the U.S.,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Craig W. Rupert of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service\u2019s Northeast Field Office.\u00a0 \u201cForeign governments continue to actively seek U.S. military technology in an effort to advance their own military development.\u00a0 Today\u2019s plea represents our continuing efforts to safeguard sensitive technology and to shield America\u2019s investment in national defense by thwarting those who try to illegally acquire our national security assets.\u201d\n\nAccording to court documents and statements made in court, at different times between 2001 and 2013, Khazaee was employed by three separate defense contractors.\u00a0 From at least 2009 through and including late 2013, Khazaee attempted to use trade secret, proprietary and export controlled material that he had obtained from his employers to gain employment in Iran.\n\nIn November and December 2009, Khazaee corresponded by email with an individual in Iran to whom he attempted to send, and in some cases did send, documents containing trade secret, proprietary and export controlled material relating to the Joint Strike Fighter Program.\u00a0 In one email Khazaee wrote \u201csome of these are very controlled . . . and I am taking [a] big risk.\u00a0 Again please after downloading these two Power Point files delete everything immediately.\u201d\n\nAnalysis of Khazaee\u2019s computer media revealed not only additional documents containing proprietary, trade secret and export controlled material belonging to the U.S. defense contractors at which he had been employed, but also cover letters and application documents, dating from in or about 2009 through in or about 2013, in which Khazaee sought employment with multiple state-controlled technical universities in Iran.\u00a0 In multiple letters Khazaee described the knowledge and skills he had obtained while working for the U.S. defense contractors and wrote:\u00a0 \u201c[a]s lead engineer in these projects I have learned some of the key technique[s] that could be transferred to our own industry and universities.\u201d\u00a0 Khazaee stated that he was \u201clooking for an opportunity to work in Iran, and . . . transferring my skill and knowledge to my nation.\u201d\n\nIn or about November 2013, while residing in Connecticut, Khazaee caused a shipment to be sent by truck from Connecticut to a freight forwarder located in Long Beach, California, which was intended for shipment to Iran.\u00a0 The shipment included numerous boxes and digital media containing thousands of documents consisting of sensitive technical manuals, specification sheets, technical drawings and data, and other proprietary material relating to military jet engines and the United States Air Force\u2019s F35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program and the F-22 Raptor.\u00a0 Many documents were labeled as \u201cExport-Controlled,\u201d as well as stamped with \u201cITAR-controlled\u201d warnings.\u00a0 Khazaee did not apply for nor did he obtain any export license or written authorization to export any of the documents, and the export or attempted export of such material to Iran is illegal.\n\nOn Jan. 9, 2014, Khazaee was arrested at the Newark Liberty International Airport before boarding a flight with a final destination of Iran.\u00a0 Search warrants executed on Khazaee\u2019s checked and carry-on luggage revealed additional sensitive, proprietary, trade secret and export controlled documents relating to military jet engines, in both hard copy and in electronic form on Khazaee\u2019s computer media.\u00a0 Khazaee has been detained since that time.\n\nJudge Bryan scheduled sentencing proceedings for May 20, 2015, at which time Khazaee faces up to 20 years in prison and a $1,000,000 fine.\n\nThis investigation is being led by the United States Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations in New Haven, in coordination with the New Haven Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service in New Haven and the Department of Commerce\u2019s Boston Office of Export Enforcement.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Carlin joins U.S. Attorney Daly in commending the efforts of the many other agencies and offices that were involved in this investigation, including U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices for the Central District of California, the Southern District of Indiana and the District of New Jersey, Homeland Security Investigations in Los Angeles, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Service in Los Angeles, the U.S. Air Force\u2019s Office of Special Investigations in Los Angeles and Boston, \u00a0as well as HSI, CBP, and FBI in New Jersey, and HSI, FBI and DCIS in Indianapolis.\n\nThis case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Stephen Reynolds and Krishna Patel of the National Security and Major Crimes Unit of the District of Connecticut, and Trial Attorney Brian Fleming of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division.",

            "article_text": "ATLANTA \u2013 U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Buchanan has announced his resignation, effective January 19, 2025, as the chief law enforcement officer for the Northern District of Georgia. After he was nominated by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. and confirmed by the U.S. Senate, U.S. Attorney Buchanan was sworn in as the District\u2019s 26th Presidentially-appointed and Senate-confirmed United States Attorney on May 2, 2022.\n\nDuring his tenure, U.S. Attorney Buchanan led an office of approximately 250 prosecutors, civil litigators, and administrative and support personnel in its mission to enforce federal civil and criminal laws, advocate for crime victims, and represent the United States\u2019 interests in federal court. In his role, he oversaw prosecutions involving violent crimes, firearm offenses, drug trafficking organizations, child exploitation, cybercrimes, health care fraud, public corruption, organized crime rings and gang activities, hate crimes, and civil rights violations, while also achieving significant judgments and penalties in multiple civil matters.\n\nBeyond the Northern District, U.S. Attorney Buchanan contributed to the Department of Justice\u2019s national legal policy as a member of Attorney General Merrick Garland\u2019s Advisory Committee (the \u201cAGAC\u201d), a select group of United States Attorneys who advise the Attorney General on policy matters. He served as Vice-Chair of the AGAC\u2019s Terrorism and National Security Subcommittee, leader of the Malign Foreign Influence Working Group, and a member of the Office of Management and Budget Subcommittee. In addition to Department of Justice leadership, U.S. Attorney Buchanan was a member of the interagency Domestic Terrorism Executive Committee.\n\nIn a message to the members of his office, U.S. Attorney Buchanan said:\n\n\u201cEarlier today, I tendered my resignation as United States Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia to President Biden and Attorney General Garland. It is nearly impossible for me to reduce to writing my admiration and gratitude for you. You embody the high ideals of the Department of Justice, and you live out our mission daily. The Northern District, the State of Georgia, and the United States are safer because of your efforts. During my tenure as United States Attorney, the work of this office has reached six continents. At the same time, the office has remained a steadfast and engaged leader in communities from southwest Atlanta to the Appalachian foothills. That global legal work and local community impact are hallmarks of this office. Daily, we have worked collaboratively and forged lasting partnerships with law enforcement agencies and community stakeholders, leading to innovative, thoughtful, and effective approaches to advancing safety, upholding the rule of law, and protecting civil rights for nearly eight million people in the Northern District. The talent, excellence, and integrity of this office are unparalleled. It has been the privilege of my life to serve with you as colleagues, and I am forever grateful and honored to call you my friends.\u201d\n\nUnder Mr. Buchanan\u2019s leadership, the Northern District of Georgia achieved noteworthy successes outlined below in criminal and civil cases. U.S. Attorney Buchanan created a new dedicated section, the Public Integrity & Civil Rights Section, to formalize and expand the office\u2019s civil and criminal civil rights work. And as described further below, Mr. Buchanan initiated and spearheaded many innovative collaborations with law enforcement and community stakeholders.\n\nNotable Violent Crime and National Security Achievements\n\n\n\nFraud Convictions\n\nAccomplishments in Civil Cases\n\nNarcotics Convictions\n\n\n\nMoney Laundering & Asset Recovery\n\nPublic Integrity and Civil Rights Work\n\nLaw Enforcement and Community Outreach\n\nU.S. Attorney Buchanan\u2019s tenure reflects a steadfast and robust commitment to building relationships and partnerships with law enforcement agencies and community stakeholders within the District.\n\nMr. Buchanan partnered with the Georgia Department of Public Health Northwest Health District to host a community gathering designed to increase awareness of and connect residents to local resources available to help prevent opioid use, overdoses, and deaths. This collaboration resulted from a data-driven District initiative to address concerns related to Bartow County\u2019s opioid deaths and the county\u2019s age-adjusted opioid death rate. Local public health officials who participated in the initiative also noted the alarming nationwide increases in illicit fentanyl exposures in children younger than six years old as cause for critical concern.\n\nMr. Buchanan served as a member of the Georgians for Refuge, Action, Compassion and Education (\u201cGRACE\u201d) Commission which was created to combat human trafficking in the State of Georgia.\n\nHe partnered with the Department of Justice to host the inaugural Historically Black Colleges and Universities Regional Forum at Clark Atlanta University in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nHe led the training effort with the Georgia Alliance for School Resource Officers and Educators, the Georgia Public Safety Training Center, and the Georgia Gang Investigators Association to provide an intensive law enforcement training, \u201cG.R.E.A.T.\u201d (Gang Resistance Education and Training), for more than 40 police officers from school systems in the District.\u00a0 These officers, specifically chosen by their respective agencies, serve at over 70 local schools that enroll more than 26,000 students.\n\nMr. Buchanan continued to partner with the Fulton County District Attorney\u2019s Office as part of an annual Project Safe Neighborhoods Credible Messenger Youth Summer Violence Program, which provides intensive and positive youth and young adult mentorship, with a goal to reduce recidivism, promote public safety, and improve family and community engagement.\n\nHe hosted a safety briefing for houses of worship, gathering faith leaders and those involved with security at houses of worship, to provide training, education, and discussion in the areas of safety, security, security planning, hate crimes, and the growth and management of threats.\n\nMr. Buchanan led the creation of the Northern Georgia Fentanyl Prosecution Working Group, an innovative data-driven effort aimed at the counties in the Northern District that have been hit hardest by the opioid epidemic. The effort included a coordinated multi-agency, parcel interdiction operation that resulted in the seizure of illegal drugs and firearms being shipped through the district.\n\nHe oversaw a safety briefing for school administrators and safety officials to provide education and resources for planning, assessment, and mitigation of safety threats.\n\nAnd he also organized a housing summit that focused on health and safety in HUD-assisted housing with Housing and Urban Development leadership.\n\n\u201cI thank President Biden for nominating me, Senators Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff for their recommendation and support, and Attorney General Garland for his leadership during my tenure,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Buchanan.\u00a0 \u201cIt has been an honor and a privilege to serve the American people and the Northern District of Georgia.\u201d\n\nPursuant to the Vacancies Reform Act, First Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard S. Moultrie, Jr. will succeed Mr. Buchanan as the Acting U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia until a successor is nominated by the President and confirmed by the United States Senate.\n\nFor further information please contact the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Public Affairs Office atUSAGAN.PressEmails@usdoj.govor (404) 581-6016.\u00a0 The Internet address for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Georgia ishttp://www.justice.gov/usao-ndga.",

            "article_text": "BROOKLYN, NY \u2013 A criminal complaint was unsealed today in federal court in Brooklyn charging Kaveh Lotfolah Afrasiabi, also known as \u201cLotfolah Kaveh Afrasiabi,\u201d with acting and conspiring to act as an unregistered agent of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, in violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).\u00a0 Afrasiabi was arrested yesterday at his home in Watertown, Massachusetts, and will make his initial appearance this morning in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts, before United States Magistrate Judge Jennifer C. Boal.\n\nSeth D. DuCharme, Acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York; John C. Demers, Assistant Attorney General for National Security; William F. Sweeney, Jr., Assistant Director-in-Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation, New York Field Office (FBI); and Joseph Bonavolonta, Special Agent-in-Charge, FBI, Boston Field Office announced the arrest and charges.\n\n\u201cAfrasiabi allegedly sought to influence the American public and American policymakers for the benefit of his employer, the Iranian government, by disguising propaganda as objective policy analysis and expertise,\u201d stated Acting U.S. Attorney DuCharme.\u00a0 \u201cThis Office is committed to the robust enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which provides the American people the tools they need to evaluate opinions and arguments in the marketplace of ideas by requiring foreign agents to declare their paymasters.\u00a0 Those, like the defendant, who conceal the full extent of their work for a foreign government when the law requires disclosure will face consequences for their actions.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor over a decade, Kaveh Afrasiabi pitched himself to Congress, journalists, and the American public as a neutral and objective expert on Iran,\" stated Assistant Attorney General Demers.\u00a0 \u201cHowever, all the while, Afrasiabi was actually a secret employee of the Government of Iran and the Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations (IMUN) who was being paid to spread their propaganda.\u00a0 In doing so, he intentionally avoided registering with Department of Justice as the Foreign Agents Registration Act required.\u00a0 He likewise evaded his obligation to disclose who was sponsoring his views.\u00a0 We now begin to hold him responsible for those deeds.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyone working to advance the agenda of a foreign government within the United States is required by law to register as an agent of that country,\u201d stated FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Sweeney. \u201cMr. Afrasiabi never disclosed to a Congressman, journalists or others who hold roles of influence in our country that he was being paid by the Iranian government to paint an untruthfully positive picture of the nation. Our laws are designed to create transparency in foreign relations, and they are not arbitrary or malleable. As today's action demonstrates, we will fully enforce them to protect our national security.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur arrest of Kaveh Afrasiabi makes it clear that the United States is not going to allow undeclared agents of Iran to operate in our country unchecked. For more than a decade, Mr. Afrasiabi was allegedly paid, directed, and controlled by the Government of Iran to lobby U.S. government officials, including a Congressman; and to create and disseminate information favorable to the Iranian government,\u201d stated FBI Special Agent-in-Charge Bonavolonta. \u201cThe FBI will continue to do everything it can to uncover these hidden efforts and hold accountable those who work for our adversaries to the detriment of our national security.\u201d\n\nAccording to the complaint, Afrasiabi is a citizen of the Islamic Republic of Iran and a lawful permanent resident of the United States. \u00a0\u00a0Afrasiabi holds a PhD, and frequently publishes books and articles, and appears on English-language television programs discussing foreign relations matters, particularly Iran\u2019s relations with the United States.\u00a0 Afrasiabi has identified or portrayed himself as a political scientist, a former political science professor or as an expert on foreign affairs.\n\nSince at least 2007 to the present, Afrasiabi has also been secretly employed by the Iranian government and paid by Iranian diplomats assigned to the Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations in New York City (IMUN).\u00a0 Afrasiabi has been paid approximately $265,000 in checks drawn on the IMUN\u2019s official bank accounts since 2007 and has received health insurance through the IMUN\u2019s employee health benefit plans since at least 2011.\n\nIn the course of his employment by the Iranian government, Afrasiabi has lobbied a U.S. Congressman and the U.S. Department of State to advocate for policies favorable to Iran, counseled Iranian diplomats concerning U.S. foreign policy, made television appearances to advocate for the Iranian government\u2019s views on world events, and authored articles and opinion pieces espousing the Iranian government\u2019s position on various matters of foreign policy.\u00a0 Afrasiabi has long known that FARA requires agents of foreign principals to register with the U.S. Department of Justice and has discussed information obtained from FARA disclosures with others.\u00a0 Nevertheless, Afrasiabi did not register as an agent of the Government of Iran.\n\nFor example, in January 2020, Afrasiabi emailed Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister and Permanent Representative to the United Nations with advice for \u201cretaliation\u201d for the U.S. military airstrike that killed Major General Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Quds Force, the external operations arm of the Iranian government\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, proposing that the Iranian government \u201cend all inspections and end all information on Iran\u2019s nuclear activities pending a [United Nations Security Council] condemnation of [the United States\u2019] illegal crime.\u201d\u00a0 Afrasiabi claimed that such a move would, among other things, \u201cstrike fear in the heart of [the] enemy.\u201d\n\nAfrasiabi has admitted in his own communications that his extensive body of published works and television appearances, in which he has consistently advocated perspectives and policy positions favored by the Iranian government, has been attributable to the funding he receives from the Iranian government.\u00a0 For example, in a July 28, 2020 email to Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister, Afrasiabi included \u201clinks for many of [his] works, including books, hundreds of articles in international newspapers and academic journals,\u201d telling Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister \u201cWithout support none of this would have been possible! This has been a very productive relationship spanning decades that ought not to be interrupted.\u201d\n\nThe charges in the complaint are allegations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\u00a0 If convicted of both charged offenses, Afrasiabi faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.\n\nThe government\u2019s case is being handled by the Office\u2019s National Security and Cybercrime Section.\u00a0 Assistant United States Attorneys Ian C. Richardson and Michael T. Keilty are in charge of the prosecution, with assistance from Trial Attorney David C. Recker of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.\n\nThe Defendant:\n\nKAVEH LOTFOLAH AFRASIABI (also known as \u201cLotfolah Kaveh Afrasiabi\u201d)Age: 63Watertown, Massachusetts\n\nE.D.N.Y.

Hess of the FBI.\n\nThe six-count indictment alleges that Savandi and Mansouri, acting from inside Iran, authored malware, known as \u201cSamSam Ransomware,\u201d capable of forcibly encrypting data on the computers of victims.\u00a0 According to the indictment, beginning in December 2015, Savandi and Mansouri would then allegedly access the computers of victim entities without authorization through security vulnerabilities, and install and execute the SamSam Ransomware on the computers, resulting in the encryption of data on the victims\u2019 computers.\u00a0 These more than 200 victims included hospitals, municipalities, and public institutions, according to the indictment, including the City of Atlanta, Georgia; the City of Newark, New Jersey; the Port of San Diego, California; the Colorado Department of Transportation; the University of Calgary in Calgary, Alberta, Canada; and six health care-related entities: Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles, California; Kansas Heart Hospital in Wichita, Kansas; Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, more commonly known as LabCorp, headquartered in Burlington, North Carolina; MedStar Health, headquartered in Columbia, Maryland; Nebraska Orthopedic Hospital now known as OrthoNebraska Hospital, in Omaha, Nebraska and Allscripts Healthcare Solutions Inc., headquartered in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Savandi and Mansouri would then extort victim entities by demanding a ransom paid in the virtual currency Bitcoin in exchange for decryption keys for the encrypted data, collecting ransom payments from victim entities that paid the ransom, and exchanging the Bitcoin proceeds into Iranian rial using Iran-based Bitcoin exchangers.\u00a0 The indictment alleges that, as a result of their conduct, Savandi and Mansouri have collected over $6 million USD in ransom payments to date, and caused over $30 million USD in losses to victims.\n\n\u201cThe Iranian defendants allegedly used hacking and malware to cause more than $30 million in losses to more than 200 victims,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein.\u00a0 \u201cAccording to the indictment, the hackers infiltrated computer systems in 10 states and Canada and then demanded payment. The criminal activity harmed state agencies, city governments, hospitals, and countless innocent victims.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe allegations in the indictment unsealed today\u2014the first of its kind\u2014outline an Iran-based international computer hacking and extortion scheme that engaged in 21st-century digital blackmail,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Benczkowski.\u00a0 \u201cThese defendants allegedly used ransomware to infect the computer networks of municipalities, hospitals, and other key public institutions, locking out the computer owners, and then demanded millions of dollars in payments from them.\u00a0As today\u2019s charges demonstrate, the Criminal Division and its law enforcement partners will relentlessly pursue cybercriminals who harm American citizens, businesses, and institutions, regardless of where those criminals may reside.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe defendants in this case developed and deployed the SamSam Ransomware in order to hold public and private entities hostage and then extort money from them,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Carpenito.\u00a0 \u201cAs the indictment in this case details, they started with a business in Mercer County and then moved on to major public entities, like the City of Newark, and healthcare providers, like the Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles and the Kansas Heart Hospital in Wichita\u2014cravenly taking advantage of the fact that these victims depend on their computer networks to serve the public, the sick, and the injured without interruption.\u00a0 The charges announced today show that the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of New Jersey will continue to act to disrupt such criminal acts, and identify those who are responsible for them, no matter where in the world they may seek to hide.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis indictment demonstrates the FBI\u2019s continuous commitment to unmasking malicious actors behind the world\u2019s most egregious cyberattacks,\u201d said Executive Assistant Director Hess.\u00a0 \u201cBy calling out those who threaten American systems, we expose criminals who hide behind their computer and launch attacks that threaten our public safety and national security. \u00a0The actions highlighted today, which represent a continuing trend of cyber criminal activity emanating from Iran, were particularly threatening, as they targeted public safety institutions, including U.S. hospital systems and governmental entities.\u00a0 The FBI, with the assistance of our private sector and U.S. government partners, are sending a strong message that we will work together to investigate and hold all criminals accountable.\u201d\n\nSavandi and Mansouri are charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit fraud and related activity in connection with computers, two substantive counts of intentional damage to a protected computer and two substantive counts of transmitting a demand in relation to damaging a protected computer.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Savandi and Mansouri created the first version of the SamSam Ransomware in December 2015, and created further refined versions in June and October 2017.\u00a0 In addition to employing Iran-based Bitcoin exchangers, the indictment alleges that the defendants also utilized overseas computer infrastructure to commit their attacks.\u00a0\u00a0 Savandi and Mansouri would also use sophisticated online reconnaissance techniques (such as scanning for computer network vulnerabilities) and conduct online research in order to select and target potential victims, according to the indictment.\u00a0 According to the indictment, the defendants would also disguise their attacks to appear like legitimate network activity.\n\nTo carry out their scheme, the indictment alleges that the defendants also employed the use of Tor, a computer network designed to facilitate anonymous communication over the internet.\u00a0 According to the indictment, the defendants maximized the damage caused to victims by launching attacks outside regular business hours, when a victim would find it more difficult to mitigate the attack, and by encrypting backups of the victims\u2019 computers.\u00a0 This was intended to\u2014and often did\u2014cripple the regular business operations of the victims, according to the indictment.\u00a0 The most recent ransomware attack against a victim alleged in the indictment took place on Sept. 25, 2018.\n\nThis case was investigated by the FBI\u2019s Newark Field Office.\u00a0 Senior Counsel William A. Hall Jr. of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney and Chief of the Cybercrimes Unit Justin S. Herring of the District of New Jersey are prosecuting the case.\u00a0 The Department thanks its law enforcement colleagues at the National Crime Agency (UK), West Yorkshire Police (UK), Calgary Police Service (Canada), and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.\u00a0 Significant assistance was provided by the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division and the Criminal Division\u2019s Office of International Affairs.\n\nVictims are encouraged to contact their local FBI field office and file a complaint online with the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3).\u00a0 The IC3 staff reviews complaints, looking for patterns or other indicators of significant criminal activity, and refers investigative packages of complaints to the appropriate law enforcement authorities in a particular city or region. The FBI provides a variety of resources relating to ransomware through the IC3, which can be reached atwww.ic3.gov.\u00a0\u00a0 For more information on ransomware prevention, visit:https://www.ic3.gov/media/2016/160915.aspx\n\nCharges contained in an indictment are merely allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.",

            "article_text": "On Thursday, April 23, a federal jury convicted a naturalized U.S. citizen and former Iranian national of violations of U.S. export and money laundering laws, arising from his involvement in a scheme to purchase marine navigation equipment and military electronic equipment for illegal export to, and end-use in, Iran, announced Assistant Attorney General for National Security John P. Carlin and U.S. Attorney Laura E. Duffy of the Southern District of California.\n\nArash Ghahreman, 45, of Staten Island, New York, was convicted of attempted export to Iran, and conspiracy to do the same, in violation of the Iran Trade Embargo (formerly known as the Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations); smuggling goods from the United States, and conspiracy to the same; and aiding and abetting the transfer of money from Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE), to the United States, in support of an illegal export activity, and conspiracy to do the same.\u00a0 The case involved a seven-day jury trial, beginning on April 13, 2015, and ending on April 23, 2015, when the jury returned a guilty verdict on seven counts of a nine-count superseding indictment after one day of deliberation.\u00a0 The jury was unable to reach a verdict on two of the counts involving the attempted exportation and smuggling of a fiber optic gyrocompass, used in both military and civilian marine navigation applications.\n\n\u201cThe defendants used a front company to illegally send U.S. goods and technologies \u2013 including those used in military applications \u2013 to Iran,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Carlin.\u00a0 \u201cThese violations of the Iran Trade Embargo have the potential to harm U.S. national security objectives, and we will continue to hold accountable those who seek to circumvent its restrictions.\u00a0 I would like to thank the agents and prosecutors for their hard work in obtaining this conviction.\u201d\n\nThe evidence presented at trial showed that Ghahreman acted an agent of an Iranian procurement network which used a front company in Dubai to acquire U.S. goods and technologies for illegal transshipment to, and end-use in, Iran.\u00a0 Co-defendant Koorush Taherkhani, 43, an Iranian national and resident, was the managing director and founder of that front company, co-defendant TIG Marine Engineering Services.\u00a0 Because of his German nationality, co-defendant Ergun Yildiz, 35, a resident of UAE, was hired by Taherkhani to be the \u201cface\u201d of the front company, as the president/CEO of TIG Marine.\u00a0 Before Ghahreman immigrated to the United States in 2007, Ghahreman and Taherkhani had been friends and dorm mates at an Iranian university, where each received a degree in marine engineering.\u00a0 Upon graduation, both Ghahreman and Taherkhani worked as engineers for various Iranian shipping companies, including the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines and its subsidiaries.\u00a0 After immigrating to the United States, Ghahreman was employed by various shipyards in the United States, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen.\u00a0 Because of his employment and citizenship status, Ghahreman was well placed to act as an agent of the illegal procurement network.\n\nFrom December 2012 through June 17, 2013, Ghahreman and his co-defendants negotiated via email, text, telephone and meetings with U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations (ICE-HSI) and the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) undercover agents to purchase marine navigation components (fiber optic gyrocompasses), military electronic components (electron tubes) and other U.S. technology for illegal export to, and/or end-use in, Iran.\u00a0 The undercover agents were posing as brokers of U.S. goods and technology, willing to sell U.S. goods to the defendants for end-use in Iran.\u00a0 Ultimately, as a result of these negotiations, Ghahreman and his co-defendants agreed to purchase four Navigat-2100 fiber optic gyrocompasses and 50 Y-690 units (electron tubes).\u00a0 Pursuant to that agreement, Ghahreman and his co-defendants wired approximately $60,000 in partial payment for the gyrocompasses and electron tubes from a bank in Dubai to the undercover agents\u2019 bank account.\u00a0 Ultimately, on June 17, 2013, ICE-HSI agents arrested Ghahreman and Yildiz after they traveled to the United States and took partial delivery of one gyrocompass and two electron tubes and attempted to ship the items indirectly to Iran, via third countries.\n\nGhahreman is scheduled to be sentenced on July 17, 2015, before U.S. District Judge Dana M. Sabraw of the Southern District of California.\u00a0 Yildiz pleaded guilty to conspiracy to export to Iran on Oct. 9, 2014, and is scheduled to be sentenced on May 8, 2015, before Judge Sabraw.\u00a0 Co-defendant Taherkhani, an Iranian national and resident, remains a fugitive.\u00a0 Co-defendant TIG Marine is a Dubai company.\n\nThe case was investigated by ICE-HSI and DCIS. \u00a0The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Shane P. Harrigan and Timothy D. Coughlin of the Southern District of California, with assistance provided by the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division.",

            "article_text": "Deirdre M. Daly, United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut, and Assistant Attorney General for National Security John P. Carlin announced that MOZAFFAR KHAZAEE, 61, formerly of Manchester, Connecticut, was sentenced today by U.S. District Judge Vanessa L. Bryant in Hartford to 97 months of imprisonment, followed by\u00a0 three years of supervised release, for attempting to send to Iran voluminous hard copy documents, computer media and electronic data containing highly sensitive, proprietary, trade secret and export controlled material relating to U.S. military jet engines, which he had stolen from multiple U.S. defense contractors where he had previously been employed.\u00a0 KHAZAEE also was ordered to pay a $50,000 fine.\n\n\u201cMozaffar Khazaee betrayed his defense contractor employers and the national security interests of the United States by stealing and attempting to send to Iran voluminous documents containing highly sensitive U.S. defense technology,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Daly.\u00a0 \u201cU.S. companies are being relentlessly targeted by those who seek to steal our intellectual property, our trade secrets and our advanced defense technology \u2013 whether through a computer hack or cyber intrusion, or through an insider or rogue employee.\u00a0 As this case demonstrates, we will aggressively investigate and hold accountable those who attempt to steal trade secrets and military technology from U.S. industries, whether for their own personal gain or for the benefit of foreign actors.\u201d\n\n\u201cMozaffar Khazaee exploited his privileged access to national security assets to steal highly sensitive military technology with the intent of providing it to Iran,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Carlin.\u00a0 \u201cViolations of the Arms Export Control Act, particularly those involving attempts to transfer sensitive defense technology to a foreign power, are among the most significant national security threats we face, and we will continue to leverage the criminal justice system to prevent, confront, and disrupt them.\u201d\n\n\u201cStopping people like Mozaffar Khazaee from providing U.S. military technology to foreign powers is crucial to our national security interests,\u201d said Matthew Etre, Special Agent in Charge of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Boston.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s abundantly clear from court records that this individual intended to harm U.S. interests both here and abroad.\u00a0 HSI will continue to work with our federal law enforcement partners to ensure that advanced U.S. military technology is not stolen and illegally exported for the benefit of foreign entities.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Khazaee abused a position of trust and responsibility by stealing trade secrets and sensitive information belonging to defense contractors developing some of our most advanced aircraft,\u201d said Assistant Director Randall C. Coleman of the FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Division.\u00a0 \u201cHis actions could have put our national security at risk.\u00a0 Stopping his plan and holding him accountable for his betrayal was a whole-of-government effort.\u00a0 We will use all available legal means to pursue individuals willing to help our adversaries by stealing our technical know-how.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe evidence developed during this investigation and today\u2019s sentencing of Mr. Khazaee illustrate the potential for harm to the U.S. through illegal exportation of sensitive documents and technology,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Craig W. Rupert, Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS), Northeast Field Office.\u00a0 \u201cDCIS, along with our partner agencies, continues to prioritize and pursue these investigations to curtail any adverse impact to America's warfighters and shield America's investment in national defense.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis case was enabled by the outstanding teamwork amongst the many federal law enforcement agencies and U.S. Attorney\u2019s office,\u201d said Danielle Angley, Special Agent-in-Charge with the Air Force Office of Special Investigations.\u00a0 \u201cCritical was the ability to leverage subject matter experts from the Air Force\u2019s acquisition community who provided the technical assessments of the high value technology.\u00a0 While the conclusion of this case neutralized the threat of this particular person, it also highlights the need for continued and ever more vigilant protection of our critical technologies.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday's sentencing demonstrates the ongoing cooperation between the U.S. Department of Commerce and other federal law enforcement partners working together in unison to prevent sensitive U.S. origin technology from falling into the wrong hands,\u201d said John McKenna, Special Agent in Charge of the Department of Commerce\u2019s Boston Office of Export Enforcement.\n\nAccording to court documents and statements made in court, at different times between 2001 and 2013, KHAZAEE, a dual citizen of Iran and the United States with a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering, was employed by three separate defense contractors.\u00a0 From at least 2009 through late 2013, KHAZAEE offered to provide trade secret, proprietary and export controlled defense technology that he had stolen from his U.S. employers to gain employment with state-controlled technical universities in Iran.\n\nBeginning in late 2009, KHAZAEE corresponded by email with an individual in Iran to whom he attempted to send, and in some cases did send, documents containing trade secret, proprietary and export controlled material relating to the Joint Strike Fighter Program.\u00a0 In one email KHAZAEE stated that the material he had attached was \u201cvery controlled . . . and I am taking [a] big risk.\u201d KHAZAEE instructed the individual in Iran, \u201cafter downloading,\u201d he should \u201cdelete everything immediately.\u201d\n\nAnalysis of KHAZAEE\u2019s computer media also revealed cover letters and application documents that KHAZAEE sent to multiple state-controlled technical universities in Iran.\u00a0 In those materials, KHAZAEE stated that as \u201clead engineer\u201d in various projects with U.S. defense contractors, he had learned \u201ckey technique[s] that could be transferred to our own industry and universities.\u201d\u00a0 KHAZAEE stated that he wanted to \u201cmove to Iran,\u201d that he was \u201clooking for an opportunity to work in Iran,\u201d and that he was interested in \u201ctransferring my skill and knowledge to my nation.\u201d\n\nIn approximately November 2013, while residing in Connecticut, KHAZAEE attempted to send a large shipping container to Iran.\u00a0 The shipment included, in numerous boxes and on computer media, thousands of highly sensitive technical manuals, specification sheets, test results, technical drawings and data, and other proprietary material relating to U.S. military jet engines, including those relating to the U.S. Air Force\u2019s F35 Joint Strike Fighter (\u201cJSF\u201d) program and the F-22 Raptor.\u00a0 The materials in the interdicted shipment had been stolen from U.S. defense contractors where KHAZAEE had worked, and many documents were prominently labeled with strict export control warnings.\u00a0 KHAZAEE did not apply for nor did he obtain any license to export any of the documents, and the export or attempted export of such material to Iran is illegal.\n\nOn January 9, 2014, KHAZAEE was arrested at the Newark Liberty International Airport before boarding a flight to Iran.\u00a0 Search warrants executed on KHAZAEE\u2019s checked and carry-on luggage revealed additional hard copy documents and computer media containing sensitive, proprietary, trade secret and export controlled documents relating to U.S. military jet engines.\u00a0 KHAZAEE also was found in the possession of $59,945 in as-yet undeclared cash, which he had split up into increments of approximately $5,000 and secreted in multiple bank envelopes in various places in his carry-on luggage.\n\nThe hard copy and electronic material that KHAZAEE stole and sought to transfer to Iran totaled some 50,000 pages and was reviewed by experts from both the U.S. Air Force and the victim defense contractors.\u00a0 In addition to the materials relating to the JSF Program and the F-22 Raptor, KHAZAEE also had documents from numerous other U.S. military engine programs, including the V-22 Osprey, the C130J Hercules and the Global Hawk engine programs.\u00a0 In total, KHAZAEE sought to export approximately 1,500 documents containing trade secrets and approximately 600 documents containing highly sensitive defense technology.\n\nAccording to analyses by the U.S. Air Force and victim defense contractors, the technical data that KHAZAEE stole would have helped Iran \u201cleap forward\u201d 10 years or more in academic and military turbine engine research and development, reducing their investment in such technology by one to two billion dollars, and potentially enhancing the development and effectiveness of their weapon systems.\n\nKHAZAEE has been detained since his arrest On January 9, 2014.\u00a0 On February 25, 2015, he pleaded guilty to one count of unlawful export and attempted export of defense articles from the U.S. in violation of the Arms Export Control Act.\n\nThis matter has been investigated by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in New Haven, the New Haven Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service in New Haven, the U.S. Air Force\u2019s Office of Special Investigations in Boston, and the Department of Commerce\u2019s Office of Export Enforcement in Boston.\n\nU.S. Attorney Daly and Assistant Attorney General Carlin also commended the efforts of the many other agencies and offices that were involved in this investigation, including the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices for the Central District of California, the Southern District of Indiana and the District of New Jersey, HSI in Los Angeles, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Service in Los Angeles, the U.S. Air Force\u2019s Office of Special Investigations in Los Angeles, as well as HSI, CBP, and FBI in New Jersey, and HSI, FBI and DCIS in Indianapolis.\n\nThis case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Reynolds of the National Security and Major Crimes Unit of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Connecticut, and Trial Attorney Brian Fleming of the Justice Department\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section (CES).",

            "article_text": "Note:View the indictment here.\n\nFormer Federal Aviation Administration contractor, Abouzar Rahmati, 42, a naturalized U.S. citizen and resident of Great Falls, Virginia, was indicted for acting and conspiring to act as an agent of the Iranian government in the United States without prior notice to the Attorney General. He made his initial appearance in the District of Columbia today this afternoon.\n\nAccording to the indictment, from at least December 2017 through June 2024, Rahmati conspired with Iranian government officials and intelligence operatives to act on their behalf in the United States, including by meeting with Iranian intelligence officers in Iran, communicating with coconspirators using a cover story to hide his conduct, obtaining employment with an FAA contractor with access to sensitive non-public information, and obtaining open-source and non-public materials about the U.S. solar energy industry and providing it to Iranian intelligence.\n\n\u201cAs alleged, the defendant conspired with Iranian officials and intelligence operatives, even lying to obtain employment as a U.S. government contractor only to then share sensitive government materials with Iran,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division. \u201cWhen undisclosed agents of Iran or any other foreign government seek to infiltrate American companies or government agencies, the Justice Department will use every available tool to identify them and bring them to justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis defendant is charged with infiltrating a U.S. agency with the intent of providing Iran with sensitive information vital to our national security,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves for the District of Columbia. \u201cThanks to the great work of the FBI and the FAA\u2019s investigators, this defendant was stopped in his tracks and a known adversary\u2019s plot was exposed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis indictment describes the reprehensible actions of an individual who allegedly betrayed his country by transferring sensitive U.S. information to a foreign power. This alleged betrayal not only undermines our national security but also puts U.S. jobs and livelihoods at risk,\u201d said Executive Assistant Director Robert Wells of the FBI\u2019s National Security Branch. \u201cWe will not tolerate any actions that compromise U.S.-based sensitive information and are committed to ensuring that justice is served swiftly and decisively.\u201d\n\nAccording to the indictment, from June 2009 to May 2010, Rahmati served as a First Lieutenant in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) \u2014 an Iranian military and counterintelligence organization under the authority of the Supreme Leader of Iran. After being discharged from the IRGC, Rahmati lied to the United States government regarding his military service with the IRGC in order to, among other things, gain employment as a U.S. government contractor.\n\nIn August 2017, Rahmati offered his services to the Iranian government through a senior Iranian government official who previously worked in Iran\u2019s Ministry of Intelligence and Security and with whom Rahmati had previously attended university. Four months later, in December 2017, Rahmati traveled to Iran, where he met with Iranian intelligence operatives and government officials and agreed to obtain information about the U.S. solar energy industry, to provide that information to Iranian officials, and to conduct future communications under a cover story based on purported discussions about research with fellow academics.\n\nAfter Rahmati returned to the United States in December 2017, he obtained various non-public and open-source materials related to the U.S. solar energy industry and provided them to an Iranian government official. Rahmati also applied for multiple positions with private companies and U.S. government entities that would provide him with access to sensitive information, eventually obtaining a position with U.S. Company 1 supporting the FAA on a contract related to the power and electrical architecture of the FAA\u2019s National Airspace System (NAS). After Rahmati obtained the position, he informed an Iranian intelligence officer that he was \u201cin the process of moving to and joining a new company\u201d and that they could \u201cwork more effectively if it is finalized.\u201d\n\nIn response to tasking from Iranian officials, and in furtherance of his agency relationship with the Government of Iran, Rahmati exploited his employment with U.S. Company 1 by downloading sensitive non-public U.S. Company 1 documents related to the FAA, storing them on removable media, and taking them to Iran, where he provided the documents to the Government of Iran in April 2022. These included documents related to the NAS that would give a person unfamiliar with NAS facility engineering a reasonable understanding of how the NAS power and electrical architecture is configured.\n\nAfter he returned to the United States in April 2022, in response to tasking from Iranian government officials, Rahmati sent additional information relating to solar energy, solar panels, the FAA, U.S. airports, and U.S. air traffic control towers to his brother, a co-conspirator, so that he would provide those files to Iranian intelligence on behalf of Rahmati.\n\nThe FBI Washington Field Office is investigating the case. FAA\u2019s Office of Counterintelligence and Technical Operations provided significant assistance.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorneys Christopher Tortorice and Kimberly Paschall for the District of Columbia and Trial Attorneys Beau Barnes and Alexander Wharton of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting the case. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia provided significant assistance.",

            "article_text": "An indictment was unsealed today charging Mohammed Reza Rezakhah, 39 and Mohammed Saeed Ajily, 35, both Iranian nationals,\u00a0with a criminal conspiracy relating to computer fraud and abuse, unauthorized access to, and theft of information from, computers, wire fraud, exporting a defense article without a license, and violating sanctions against Iran. The court issued arrest warrants for both defendants.\n\nActing Assistant Attorney General for National Security Dana J. Boente, Acting U.S. Attorney Eugenia A.P. Cowles of the District of Vermont, Assistant Director Scott Smith of the FBI\u2019s Cyber Division, and Special Agent in Charge Vadim Thomas of the FBI\u2019s Albany, New York Field Office made the announcement.\n\nAccording to the allegations in the indictment filed in Rutland, Vermont, beginning in or around 2007, Rezakhah, Ajily, and a third actor who has already pleaded guilty in the District of Vermont for related conduct, conspired together to access computers without authorization in order to obtain software which they would then sell and redistribute in Iran and elsewhere outside the U.S. Ajily, a businessman, would task Rezakhah and others with stealing or unlawfully cracking particular pieces of valuable software. Rezakhah would then conduct unauthorized intrusions into victim networks to steal the desired software. Once the software was obtained, Ajily marketed and sold the software through various companies and associates to Iranian entities, including universities and military and government entities, specifically noting that such sales were in contravention of U.S. export controls and sanctions.\n\nAs part of this conspiracy, in October 2012, Rezakhah hacked a Vermont-based engineering consulting and software design company best known for its software that supports aerodynamics analysis and design for projectiles. This software is designated as a \u201cdefense article\u201d on the U.S. Munitions List of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), meaning it cannot be exported from the U.S. without a license from the U.S. Department of State. Ajily thereafter promoted the same software as one of the products he could offer to his Iranian clients.\n\nThe charges in the indictment are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s Albany Cyber Squad investigated the case.The case is being prosecuted by Acting U.S. Attorney Eugenia A.P. Cowles of the District of Vermont and Deputy Chief Sean Newell of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs also provided significant assistance in this matter.",

Garland said:\u00a0\u201cThere are few actors in the world that pose as grave a threat to the national security of the United States as does Iran.\u00a0 The Justice Department has charged an asset of the Iranian regime who was tasked by the regime to direct a network of criminal associates to further Iran\u2019s assassination plots against its targets, including President-elect Donald J. Trump. \u00a0We have also charged and arrested two individuals who we allege were recruited as part of that network to silence and kill, on U.S. soil, an American journalist who has been a prominent critic of the regime. \u00a0We will not stand for the Iranian regime\u2019s attempts to endanger the American people and America\u2019s national security.\u201d\n\nFBI Director Christopher A.

Dennehy said:\u00a0\u201cThese individuals allegedly plotted to murder an American citizen \u2013 on our soil \u2013 at the direction of a foreign terrorist organization, the IRGC.\u00a0 This case is an example of yet another flagrant attempt by the Government of Iran, not merely to silence those who speak out against them, but to take the lives of American citizens exercising their constitutionally protected rights here in this country.\u00a0 As we remain unwavering in our mission to protect the American people, the FBI will continue to aggressively pursue justice against anyone attempting to use violence to violate our freedoms and way of life.\u201d\n\nFBI Assistant Director in Charge David Sundberg said:\u00a0\u201cThe charges announced today further demonstrate the IRGC's continued campaign to silence and kill Americans who criticize the Iranian regime.\u00a0 Through collaboration with FBI New York's Joint Terrorism Task Force and federal prosecutors at the Justice Department and the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0Attorney\u2019s\u00a0Office, we have successfully disrupted the defendants\u2019\u00a0alleged plots\u00a0to fulfill Iran\u2019s goals of permanently eliminating voices of opposition. We vow to continue to work with our partners to stop IRGC operatives and associates who seek to harm our citizens on our soil.\u201d\n\nAccording to the allegations contained in the Complaint charging the defendants and other public statements and filings:[1]\n\n\n\nThe Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran (the\u00a0\u201cGovernment of Iran\u201d) is actively targeting nationals of the United States and its allies living in countries around the world for attacks, including assault,\u00a0kidnapping, and murder, both to repress and silence dissidents critical of the Iranian regime and to take vengeance for the January 2020 death of then-Commander of the Islamic\u00a0 Revolutionary Guard Corps (\u201cIRGC\u201d) Qods Force (\u201cIRGC-QF\u201d), Qasem Soleimani, who was killed by a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad.\u00a0 The IRGC is an Iranian military and counterintelligence agency under the authority of Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader, comprised of components including an external operations force, the IRGC-QF, and has been designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. Secretary of State since April 15, 2019.\u00a0The IRGC has publicly stated its desire to avenge the death of Soleimani, and, among its activities, the IRGC plots and conducts attack operations outside Iran targeting U.S. citizens residing in the United States and abroad.\n\nSHAKERI is an IRGC asset residing in Tehran, Iran.\u00a0SHAKERI immigrated to the United States as a child and was deported in or about 2008 after serving 14 years in prison for a robbery conviction.\u00a0 In recent months, SHAKERI has used a network of criminal associates he met in prison in the United States to supply the IRGC with operatives to conduct surveillance and assassinations of\u00a0IRGC targets.\u00a0 Two members of SHAKERI\u2019s network are his co-defendants, LOADHOLT and RIVERA.\u00a0 At SHAKERI\u2019s instruction, LOADHOLT and RIVERA have spent months surveilling a U.S. citizen of Iranian origin residing in the United States (\u201cVictim-1\u201d).\u00a0 Victim-1 is an outspoken critic of the Iranian regime and has been the target of multiple prior plots for kidnapping and/or murder directed by the Government of Iran.\u00a0 In exchange for SHAKERI\u2019s promise of $100,000, RIVERA and LOADHOLT repeatedly sought to locate Victim-1 for murder.\n\nDuring their efforts to locate and kill Victim-1, SHAKERI, LOADHOLT, and RIVERA shared messages about their progress and photographs relating to their scheme.\u00a0 For example, in or about February\u00a02024, RIVERA and LOADHOLT messaged about an incoming payment from SHAKERI, and then traveled to Fairfield University, where Victim-1 was scheduled to appear, and took photographs on campus.\u00a0 In or about April 2024, SHAKERI sent RIVERA a series of voice notes discussing their efforts to locate and kill Victim-1.\u00a0 In one voice note, SHAKERI told RIVERA that Victim-1 spent most of her time in particular locations of her home, and told RIVERA that\u00a0\u201cyou just gotta have patience . . . You gotta wait and have patience to catch her either going in the house or coming out, or following her out somewhere and taking care of it.\u00a0 Don\u2019t think about going in.\u00a0 In is a suicide move.\u201d\u00a0 On several occasions over the last several months, consistent with this instruction from SHAKERI, RIVERA and/or LOADHOLT have surveilled a location in Brooklyn that they had identified as associated with Victim-1.\n\nIn addition, according to statements made by Shakeri in recorded interviews with law enforcement agents, the IRGC has also tasked Shakeri with carrying out other assassinations against U.S. and Israeli citizens located in the United States.\u00a0 In particular, Shakeri has informed law enforcement that he was tasked\u00a0on October 7, 2024, with providing a plan to kill President-elect Donald J. Trump.\u00a0 During the interview, Shakeri claimed he did not intend to propose a plan to kill Trump within the timeframe set by the IRGC.\u00a0 He also stated he was tasked with surveilling two Jewish American citizens residing in New York City and offered $500,000 by an IRGC official for the murder of either victim.\u00a0 He was also tasked with targeting Israeli tourists in Sri Lanka.\n\n*\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0*\n\nSHAKERI, 51, of Iran, RIVERA, 49, of Brooklyn, New York, and LOADHOLT, 36, of Staten Island, New York, have all been charged with murder-for-hire, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison; conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison; and money laundering conspiracy, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.\n\nSHAKERI has also been charged with conspiring to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison;\u00a0 providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison; and conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and sanctions against the Government of Iran, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.\n\nThe maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be imposed by a judge.\n\nMr. Williams praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI\u2019s New York Joint Terrorism Task Force, which principally consists of agents and analysts from the FBI and detectives from the New York City Police Department, and the FBI Washington Field Office.\u00a0 Mr. Williams also thanked the Department of Justice\u2019s National Security Division, U.S. Customs and Border Protection New York Field Office, the Drug Enforcement Administration New York Division, and the New York State Police.\n\nThis case is being handled by the Office\u2019s National Security and International Narcotics Unit.\u00a0 Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jacob Gutwillig and Michael Lockard, and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Julie Isaacson are in charge of the prosecution, with assistance from National Security Division Trial Attorneys Dmitry Slavin of the Counterterrorism Section, and Christopher Rigali and Leslie Esbrook of the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.\n\nThe charges in the Complaint are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\n\n\n\n[1]As the introductory phrase signifies, the Complaint and the description of the Complaint set forth herein constitute only allegations, and every fact described should be treated as an allegation.",

Luft was arrested on Feb. 17 in the Republic of Cyprus based on the charges in the indictment. Luft subsequently fled after being released on bail while extradition proceedings were pending and remains a fugitive.\n\nAccording to the allegations contained in the indictment, for years, Luft conspired with others in an effort to act within the United States to advance the interests of the People\u2019s Republic of China (China) as agents of China-based principals, without registering as foreign agents as required under U.S. law. As part of this scheme, while serving as the co-director of a Maryland-based nonprofit think tank, Luft agreed to covertly recruit and pay, on behalf of principals based in China, a former high-ranking U.S. government official (Individual-1), including in 2016 while the former official was an adviser to the then-President-elect, to publicly support certain policies with respect to China without Luft or Individual-1 filing a registration statement as an agent of a foreign principal with the Attorney General of the United States, in violation of FARA.\n\nAmong other things, in the weeks before the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Luft and a co-conspirator (CC-1), who is a Chinese national and worked for a Chinese nongovernmental organization affiliated with a Chinese energy company, created a written \u201cdialogue\u201d between CC-1 and Individual-1, in which Luft wrote Individual-1\u2019s responses and included information that was favorable to China. The dialogue was then published in a Chinese newspaper online and sent to, among others, individuals in the United States, including a journalist and professors at multiple U.S. universities. When Luft was writing the dialogue, CC-1 told Luft that \u201c[i]n these articles, we do not want to spill all the beans yet, just enough to let \u2018people\u2019 know he [i.e., Individual-1] is in the corridor of power to be. Just broad stroke policy consideration that leaves plenty of room for interpretation and imagination to be filled in later.\u201d After the purported \u201cconversations\u201d were published, Luft told CC-1 that certain information, favorable to China, had been \u201ctucked between the lines.\u201d Shortly after the 2016 election, Luft and CC-1 also discussed possible roles Individual-1 might have in the incoming U.S. administration, and discussed Individual-1 taking a \u201csilent trip\u201d to China. Luft responded that \u201c[w]e are debating about his role in the new admin. There are all kinds of considerations . . .We should talk ftf [i.e., face-to-face] as there can be a supremely unique opportunity for china.\u201d\n\nSecond, Luft conspired with others and attempted to broker illicit arms transactions with, among others, certain Chinese individuals and entities. In his role as a broker or middleman, Luft worked to find both buyers and sellers of certain weapons and other materials, without a license to do so as required under U.S. law, in violation of the Arms Export Control Act. Among other things, Luft worked to broker a deal for Chinese companies to sell certain weapons to Libya, including anti-tank launchers, grenade launchers and mortar rounds (which Luft and his associates referred to in coded language as \u201ctoys\u201d). Luft also worked to broker deals for certain weapons to be sold to the United Arab Emirates, including arial bombs and rockets. Luft further worked to broker deals for certain weapons to be sold by a Chinese company to Kenya, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) \u2013 and specifically \u201cstrike\u201d UAVs, which Luft acknowledged \u201c[t]he US doesn\u2019t want to sell[, . . .] hence the opportunity.\u201d Luft also discussed brokering a deal for weapons to Qatar, and told CC-1 that Israel was \u201cnot a good fit\u201d as the middleman for the deal because it had the \u201c[s]ame problem the [] Q [i.e., Qataris] have w uncle [i.e., the United States]. Need a third party. . . . I will activate.\u201d In his role as a broker for illicit arms deals, Luft worked on a commission basis, and traveled to meetings and received and passed on documentation needed to secure the deals. During a voluntary interview with U.S. law enforcement in which he was asked questions about his involvement in arms trafficking, Luft made multiple false statements, including that he had just been checking prices for a friend and had not sought to engage in or profit from arms deals.\n\nThird, Luft conspired with others and attempted to broker deals for Iranian oil \u2013 which he directed an associate to refer to as \u201cBrazilian\u201d oil in an effort to conceal the activity and evade sanctions \u2013 in violation of U.S. sanctions against Iran and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). In his role as a broker or middleman, Luft solicited buyers and passed on pricing and other information. One offer letter for Iranian oil that Luft received noted that the \u201corigin\u201d of the oil was \u201cIranian / It can be presented as UAE origin without Iranian papers.\u201d He also assisted in setting up meetings between Iranian representatives and a Chinese energy company for the purpose of discussing oil deals. During a voluntary interview with U.S. law enforcement in which he was asked about his role brokering deals in Iranian oil, Luft made multiple false statements, including that he had tried to prevent oil deals with Iran and had not been present during meetings with the Chinese energy company and Iranians.\n\nLuft is charged with the following offenses, which carry the maximum prison terms listed below. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nCount\n\nCharge\n\nMaximum Prison Term\n\nOne\n\nConspiracy to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act\n\nFive years\n\nTwo\n\nConspiracy to violate the Arms Export Control Act\n\nFive years\n\nThree\n\nViolation of the Arms Export Control Act (relating to Libya)\n\n20 years\n\nFour\n\nViolation of the Arms Export Control Act (relating to the United Arab Emirates)\n\n20 years\n\nFive\n\nViolation of the Arms Export Control Act (relating to Kenya)\n\n20 years\n\nSix\n\nMaking false statements\n\nFive years\n\nSeven\n\nConspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act\n\n20 years\n\nEight\n\nMaking false statements\n\nFive years\n\nThe FBI New York Field Office and FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Division are investigating the case, with valuable assistance provided by the IRS-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) and the Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorneys Daniel C.

            "article_text": "The Department of Justice obtained more than $2.2 billion in settlements and judgments from civil cases involving fraud and false claims against the government in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 2020, Acting Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Bossert Clark of the Department of Justice\u2019s Civil Division announced today.\u00a0 Recoveries since 1986, when Congress substantially strengthened the civil False Claims Act, now total more than $64 billion.\n\n\u201cEven in the face of a nationwide pandemic, the department\u2019s dedicated employees continued to investigate and litigate cases involving fraud against the government and to ensure that citizens\u2019 tax dollars are protected from abuse and are used for their intended purposes,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Clark.\u00a0 \u201cThe continued success of the department\u2019s False Claims Act enforcement efforts are a testament to the dedication of the civil servants who pursue these important cases as well as to the fortitude of whistleblowers who report fraud.\u201d\n\nOf the more than $2.2 billion in settlements and judgments recovered by the Department of Justice this past fiscal year, over $1.8 billion relates to matters that involved the health care industry, including drug and medical device manufacturers, managed care providers, hospitals, pharmacies, hospice organizations, laboratories, and physicians.\u00a0 The amounts included in the $1.8 billion reflect only federal losses, and, in many of these cases, the department was instrumental in recovering additional tens of millions of dollars for state Medicaid programs.\n\nIn addition to combating health care fraud, the False Claims Act serves as the government\u2019s primary civil tool to redress false claims for federal funds and property involving a multitude of other government operations and functions.\u00a0 The act helps to support our military and first responders by ensuring that government contractors provide equipment that is safe, effective, and cost efficient; to safeguard American businesses and workers by promoting compliance with customs laws, trade agreements, visa requirements, and small business protections; and to protect other critical government programs ranging from the provision of disaster relief funds to nutrition benefits for needy families.\n\nIn 1986, Congress strengthened the act by increasing incentives for whistleblowers to file lawsuits alleging false claims on behalf of the government.\u00a0 These whistleblower, orqui tam, actions comprise a significant percentage of the False Claims Act cases that are filed.\u00a0 If the government prevails in aqui tamaction, the whistleblower, also known as the relator, typically receives a portion of the recovery ranging between 15 and 30 percent.\u00a0 Whistleblowers filed 672qui tamsuits in fiscal year 2020, and this past year the department recovered over $1.6 billion in these and earlier-filed suits.\n\nHealth Care Fraud\n\nThe department\u2019s health care fraud enforcement efforts restore funds to federal programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE, the health care program for service members and their families.\u00a0 But just as important, the department\u2019s vigorous pursuit of health care fraud prevents billions more in losses by deterring others who might otherwise try to cheat the system for their own gain. \u00a0The department investigates and resolves matters involving a wide array of health care providers, goods, and services.\n\nThe largest recoveries in the past year came from the drug industry.\u00a0 For example, following years of litigation and multiple unsuccessful attempts to have the government\u2019s claims dismissed,Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporationpaid over $591 million to resolve claims that it paid kickbacks to doctors to induce them to prescribe its drugs.\u00a0 Novartis sales representatives, on the instruction of their managers, selected high-volume prescribers to serve as paid \u201cspeakers\u201d to induce the prescribers to write Novartis prescriptions.\n\nThe department also continued to investigate efforts by drug manufacturers to protect high drug prices by funding the co-payments of Medicare patients.\u00a0 Congress included co-pay requirements in the Medicare program, in part, to serve as a check on health care costs, including the prices that pharmaceutical manufacturers can demand for their drugs.\u00a0 This year, two pharmaceutical manufacturers \u2013NovartisandGilead Sciences\u2013 paid a combined total of over $148 million to resolve claims that they illegally paid patient copays for their own drugs through purportedly independent foundations that the companies in fact treated as mere conduits for these payments.\u00a0 In addition,fourof the purportedly independentfoundationspaida total of $13 million this year to resolve liability for their involvement in the kickback schemes.\u00a0 In August 2020, the department suedTeva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. and Teva Neurosciences, Inc., alleging that they conspired with two purportedly independent foundations to illegally subsidize Medicare co-pays for the drug Copaxone.\n\nThe department continued to pursue opioid-related fraud schemes.\u00a0 One of the largest opioid-related recoveries this past year was fromPractice Fusion, Inc.,a health information technology developer that accepted kickbacks from the opioid manufacturer Purdue Pharma in exchange for implementing clinical decision support alerts in its electronic health records (EHR) software that were designed to increase prescriptions for OxyContin, and caused its users to submit false claims for federal incentive payments by misrepresenting the capabilities of its EHR software.\u00a0 In addition, the $145 millionPractice Fusionsettlement reflects that complex EHR-related fraud schemes remain a focus of the Department\u2019s work.\n\nKickbacks in the healthcare industry are pernicious because of their potential to subvert medical decision-making.\u00a0 In addition to pursuing improper payments by drug manufacturers, the department resolved other schemes involving the willful solicitation or payment of illegal remuneration to induce the purchase of a good or service paid for by a federal health care program.\u00a0 For example,ResMed Corp., a durable medical equipment manufacturer, agreed to pay more than $37 million to resolve allegations that it paid kickbacks to suppliers, sleep labs, and other health care providers. \u00a0TheOklahoma Center for Orthopaedic and Multi-Specialty Surgery, a specialty hospital in Oklahoma City, its part-owner and management company, an orthopedic physician group, and two physicians agreed to pay a total of over $72 million to resolve allegations that the hospital provided improper remuneration to the physician group in exchange for patient referrals.UTC Laboratories Inc.(RenRX) agreed to pay $41.6 million, and its three principals agreed to pay $1 million, to resolve allegations that they paid kickbacks in exchange for laboratory referrals for pharmacogenetic testing and for furnishing and billing for tests that were not medically necessary.\n\nIn addition to these recoveries, in March 2020, the department filed a complaint against medical device manufacturerSpineFrontier, Inc., its Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Kingsley Chin, and certain related entities and individuals, alleging that they paid kickbacks to spine surgeons in the form of sham \u201cconsulting\u201d agreements to induce use of SpineFrontier surgical devices.\n\nAs in years past, the department also resolved a number of matters in which providers billed federal health care programs for medically unnecessary services or services not rendered as billed.\u00a0 For example,Universal Health Servicespaid $117 million to resolve allegations that its inpatient psychiatric hospitals and residential psychiatric and behavioral treatment facilities knowingly submitted false claims for inpatient behavioral health services that were not reasonable or medically necessary and/or failed to provide adequate and appropriate services to its patients.\u00a0 Additionally,Logan Laboratories, Inc., pain clinic Tampa Pain Relief Centers, Inc., and two of their former executivesagreed to pay a total of $41 million to resolve allegations that they automatically ordered both presumptive and definitive urine drug tests for all patients at every visit, without any individualized determination that either test was medically necessary for the particular patients for whom the tests were ordered.\n\nThe department also pursued health care frauds arising under government contracts, as in the case of its $1.85 million settlement with Veterans Administration contractorSterling Medical Associatesfor allegedly failing to offer timely appointments to veterans and falsifying wait times at Minnesota outpatient clinics.\n\nProcurement Fraud\n\nIn the past year, the department also pursued a variety of other fraud matters involving the government\u2019s purchase of goods and services.\u00a0 For example, major federal contractorsBechtel National Inc., Bechtel Corporation, AECOM Energy & Construction, Inc., and their joint venture Waste Treatment Completion Company, LLCagreed to pay over $57 million to resolve allegations that they submitted false claims to the U.S. Department of Energy by charging inflated labor hours and by billing for work not actually performed to construct and maintain the Hanford Waste Treatment Plant.\n\nIn another case,QuantaDyn Corporationagreed to pay $37 million to resolve both its criminal and civil liability for engaging in a bribery scheme to steer government contracts for training simulators to the company.\u00a0 William T. Dunn Jr., the President and Chief Executive Officer of QuantaDyn, separately agreed to pay $500,000 to resolve his personal civil liability for the alleged scheme.\n\nIn some cases, the department pursued allegations that government contractors provided goods or services that did not comply with contract requirements.\u00a0 For example,Unitrans International, Inc.agreed to pay $27 million to resolve allegations that it fraudulently induced the Army and the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) to award wartime contracts for food and trucks by falsely certifying compliance with United States sanctions against Iran. \u00a0The agreement also resolved allegations that a company associated with Unitrans falsely represented construction progress on a warehouse to induce DLA to award the prime vendor contract to provide food to U.S. troops in Afghanistan.\u00a0 In another matter,Bradken Inc., a subsidiary of Hitachi Construction Machinery and a leading supplier of high-yield steel for naval submarines, paid over $10 million to resolve allegations that it produced and sold substandard steel components for installation on U.S. Navy submarines. \u00a0The government alleged that Bradken produced castings that failed lab tests and did not meet the Navy\u2019s standards, and that its Director of Metallurgy falsified test results to hide the failures.\n\nSK Engineering & Construction Co. Ltd., one of the largest engineering firms in South Korea, paid $7.8 million to settle False Claims Act claims arising out of a fraudulent scheme to obtain a large U.S. Army construction contract in South Korea by paying millions of dollars to an Army contracting official through a fake Korean construction company.\u00a0 The firm also entered into a plea agreement with the United States and paid over $60 million in criminal fines for the same misconduct.\n\nOther Fraud Recoveries\n\nThe number and variety of judgments and settlements announced during fiscal year 2020 reflect the diversity of fraud recoveries arising under the False Claims Act.\u00a0 For example,Hybrid Tech Holdings LLC, Hybrid Technology LLC, and Ace Strength International LTD, agreed to pay $29 million to resolve allegations that they violated the False Claims Act by colluding to rig the bidding of an auction to purchase a non-performing loan from the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nThis year,threestatespaida total of over $24 million to resolve allegations that they violated the False Claims Act in their administration of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), previously known as the Food Stamp Program.\u00a0 Although the federal government funds SNAP benefits, it relies on the states to determine whether applicants are eligible for benefits, to administer those benefits, and to perform quality control to ensure that eligibility decisions are accurate.\u00a0 The settlements resolved allegations that the states submitted false quality control data and information to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for which they received performance bonuses to which they were not entitled.\n\nThe department pursued fraud in connection with Public Assistance program funds that FEMA provided to institutional applicants, such as schools and universities, for the replacement of facilities damaged by Hurricane Katrina.\u00a0 For example,Xavier University of Louisianaagreed to pay $12 million to resolve allegations that it received excess disaster assistance funds that substantially exceeded the amounts it was entitled to receive under program rules.\u00a0 The settlement with Xavier was based on false and misleading repair estimates that were submitted on its behalf by AECOM and certain affiliates, which received more than $300 million from FEMA between 2005 and 2019 to serve as technical assistance contractors in support of FEMA\u2019s disaster response efforts.\u00a0 In July 2020, the department filed a complaint against AECOM and its affiliates for their role in the alleged scheme.\n\nLinde GmbH, a multinational corporation that imports materials into the United States to build natural gas and chemical manufacturing plants, and its U.S. subsidiary, the importer of record, agreed to pay more than $22 million to resolve allegations that they knowingly made false statements on customs declarations to avoid paying duties owed on the companies\u2019 imports, including in some instances antidumping and countervailing duties.\u00a0 Linde and its subsidiary allegedly misrepresented the nature, classification, and valuation of imported merchandise, as well as the applicability of free trade agreements.\n\nThe Scripps Research Instituteagreed to pay $10 million to settle claims that it improperly charged NIH-funded research grants for time spent by researchers on non-grant related activities such as developing, preparing, and writing new grant applications, teaching, and engaging in other administrative activities.\n\nLakeway Regional Medical Center LLCagreed to pay $13.5 million to resolve allegations that it improperly obtained Federal Housing Administration insurance for a mortgage to develop a Texas hospital and used loan funds in violation of FHA requirements.\u00a0 Five other individuals and entities involved in the development project paid an additional $1.8 million for their part in the alleged scheme.\n\nHolding Individuals Accountable\n\nThe department continued its commitment to use the False Claims Act and other civil remedies to deter and redress fraud by individuals as well as corporations.\u00a0 A number of corporate settlements required individuals, particularly senior executives or owners, to pay a portion of the settlement amount, as noted above.\u00a0 The following are additional examples of recoveries involving individuals.\n\nFollowing a $260 million settlement with Health Management Associates, the department negotiated a $4.25 million civil settlement withGlenn A. Kline, D.O. and his surgical practice, Community Surgical Associates, to resolve civil allegations relating to illegal kickbacks received from two hospitals formerly operated by HMA. \u00a0To secure Dr. Kline\u2019s referrals, HMA allegedly paid Dr. Kline in excess of the fair market value of his services and paid additional amounts to benefit his practice, Community Surgical Associates. \u00a0These funding arrangements were allegedly structured to disguise payments that were, in actuality, payments for patient referrals rather than for legitimate services.\n\nIn connection with the department\u2019s litigation againstSpineFrontier,six orthopedic surgeonsagreed to pay a total of over $3.25 million to resolve allegations that they accepted kickbacks in the form of sham consulting fees from SpineFrontier and a third-party entity, Impartial Medical Experts, LLC, which was owned and controlled by the company\u2019s founder and CEO. \u00a0The consulting payments were allegedly based on the number of times the surgeons used a SpineFrontier product in a given month, as opposed to the actual time they spent consulting. \u00a0As part of the settlement agreements, each physician admitted to reporting and being paid for consulting hours in excess of actual or documented consulting time.\n\nIn another example, Texas doctorBibi Sattarand her medical practice paid $210,000 to resolve allegations that she accepted kickbacks in the form of sham laboratory processing and handling fees in exchange for referring laboratory tests to True Health Diagnostics, LLC.\n\nAs part of a $4.25 million settlement,five individual shareholders of Dave O\u2019Mara Contractor, Inc. (DOCI), an Indiana-based asphalt contractor, agreed to pay a total of nearly $2 million to resolve the United States\u2019 allegations that DOCI violated the False Claims Act by misrepresenting to the government the materials that were used to pave federally funded roads in the state of Indiana.\u00a0 Specifically, the government alleged that DOCI claimed that its hot mix asphalt mixture contained a sufficient amount of binder or glue to hold the mix together when, in fact, DOCI frequently failed to meet the minimal levels of binder required to properly pave the roads.\n\nRecoveries in Whistleblower Suits\n\nOf the $2.2 billion in settlements and judgments reported by the government in fiscal year 2020, over $1.6 billion arose from lawsuits filed under thequi tamprovisions of the False Claims Act.\u00a0 During the same period, the government paid out $309 million to the individuals who exposed fraud and false claims by filing these actions.\n\nThe number of lawsuits filed under thequi tamprovisions of the Act has grown significantly since 1986, with 672qui tamsuits filed this past year \u2013 an average of nearly 13 new cases every week.\n\n\u201cWhistleblowers with insider information are critical to identifying and pursuing new and evolving fraud schemes that might otherwise remain undetected,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Clark.\u00a0 \u201cThese individuals often make substantial sacrifices to bring these schemes to light, and our efforts to protect taxpayer funds continue to benefit from their actions.\u201d\n\nIn 1986, Senator Charles Grassley and Representative Howard Berman led the successful efforts in Congress to amend the False Claims Act to, among other things, encourage whistleblowers to come forward with allegations of fraud.\u00a0 In 2009 and 2010, further improvements were made to the False Claims Act and its whistleblower provisions.\n\nPending Recoveries\n\nThe $2.2 billion in recoveries announced today do not include settlements totaling billions of additional dollars that are not yet final or did not become final before the end of the fiscal year. \u00a0On Oct. 21, 2020, the department reached a resolution withPurdue Pharmathat provides the United States with an allowed, unsubordinated, general unsecured bankruptcy claim of $2.8 billion to resolve allegations that Purdue caused false claims to be submitted to federal health care programs arising from its conduct in promoting and unlawfully inducing prescriptions of opioids.\u00a0 The settlement remains contingent on the inclusion of certain conditions in a chapter 11 plan of reorganization. \u00a0Under a separate civil settlement, individual members of the Sackler family agreed to pay the United States $225 million arising from their alleged conduct in intensifying marketing efforts directed toward extreme, high-volume prescribers.\n\nThe department also concluded a multi-year investigation of Indivior plc related to its marketing of the opioid addiction treatment drug Suboxone. \u00a0In July 2020,Indivioragreed to pay a total of $600 million, of which $300 million was paid to resolve civil allegations that Indivior promoted Suboxone to physicians who were writing prescriptions for uses that were unsafe, ineffective, and medically unnecessary and used false and misleading claims that it was less susceptible to diversion, abuse, and accidental pediatric exposure than other buprenorphine products.\u00a0 The global resolution was conditioned on the district court\u2019s acceptance of Indivior\u2019s criminal plea, which occurred in November 2020.\n\nWhile these resolutions are not included in the total recoveries for fiscal year 2020, they are notable because they reflect significant work over the last year on opioid matters, one of the department\u2019s key priorities.\n\nActing Assistant Attorney General Clark expressed appreciation for all the work over the past year by the many public servants who continued to support the department\u2019s efforts to protect the public fisc:\u00a0 \u201cI am grateful to all those in the Civil Division and the U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices, as well as the agency Offices of Inspector General and the many other federal and state agencies who worked tirelessly, often overcoming daunting challenges, to provide substantial benefits to the taxpayers.\u201d\n\n****\n\nExcept where indicated, the government\u2019s claims in the matters described above are allegations only and there has been no determination of liability.\u00a0 The numbers contained in this press release may differ slightly from the original press releases due to accrued interest.",

Curtis, the Acting Assistant Director in Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d), announced today the unsealing of an eight-count Indictment charging GAL LUFT with offenses related to willfully failing to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (\u201cFARA\u201d), arms trafficking, Iranian sanctions violations, and making false statements to federal agents.\u00a0 LUFT, a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen, was indicted on November 1, 2022, and arrested on February 17, 2023, in the Republic of Cyprus based on the charges in the Indictment.\u00a0 LUFT subsequently fled after being released on bail while extradition proceedings were pending and remains a fugitive.\n\nU.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: \u201cAs alleged, Gal Luft, a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen and co-head of a Maryland think tank, engaged in multiple, serious criminal schemes.\u00a0 He subverted foreign agent registration laws in the United States to seek to promote Chinese policies by acting through a former high-ranking U.S. Government official; he acted as a broker in deals for dangerous weapons and Iranian oil; and he told multiple lies about his crimes to law enforcement.\u00a0 As the charges unsealed today reflect, our Office will continue to work vigorously with our law enforcement partners to detect and hold accountable those who surreptitiously attempt to perpetrate malign foreign influence campaigns here in the United States.\u201d\n\nFBI Acting Assistant Director in Charge Christie M. Curtis said: \u201cAs alleged, the defendant engaged in multiple schemes to evade sanctions and laws intended to protect our national security. \u00a0 The FBI is determined to defend our nation by enforcing laws designed to promote transparency of foreign influence within the United States.\u201d\n\nAccording to the allegations contained in the Indictment, other filings, public information, and statements made during court proceedings:[1]\n\nFor years, LUFT, a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen who serves as the co-director of a Maryland-based think tank, engaged, along with others, in multiple international criminal schemes.\n\nFirst, LUFT conspired with others in an effort to act within the United States to advance the interests of the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cChina\u201d) as agents of China-based principals, without registering as foreign agents as required under U.S. law.\u00a0 As part of this scheme, while serving as the co-director of a Maryland-based non-profit think tank, LUFT agreed to covertly recruit and pay, on behalf of principals based in China, a former high-ranking U.S. Government official (\u201cIndividual-1\u201d), including in 2016 while the former official was an adviser to the then-President-elect, to publicly support certain policies with respect to China without LUFT or Individual-1 filing a registration statement as an agent of a foreign principal with the Attorney General of the United States, in violation of FARA.\u00a0 Among other things, in the weeks before the 2016 U.S. presidential election, LUFT and a co-conspirator (\u201cCC-1\u201d), who is a Chinese national and worked for a Chinese nongovernmental organization affiliated with a Chinese energy company, created a written \u201cdialogue\u201d between CC-1 and Individual-1, in which LUFT wrote Individual-1\u2019s responses and included information that was favorable to China.\u00a0 The dialogue was then published in a Chinese newspaper online and sent to, among others, individuals in the United States, including a journalist and professors at multiple U.S. universities.\u00a0 When LUFT was writing the dialogue, CC-1 told LUFT that \u201c[i]n these articles, we do not want to spill all the beans yet, just enough to let \u2018people\u2019 know he [i.e., Individual-1] is in the corridor of power to be.\u00a0 Just broad stroke policy consideration that leaves plenty of room for interpretation and imagination to be filled in later.\u201d\u00a0 After the purported \u201cconversations\u201d were published, LUFT told CC-1 that certain information, favorable to China, had been \u201ctucked between the lines.\u201d\u00a0 Shortly after the 2016 election, LUFT and CC-1 also discussed possible roles Individual-1 might have in the incoming U.S. administration and discussed Individual-1 taking a \u201csilent trip\u201d to China.\u00a0 LUFT responded that \u201c[w]e are debating about his role in the new admin.\u00a0 There are all kinds of considerations . . .We should talk ftf [i.e., face-to-face] as there can be a supremely unique opportunity for china.\u201d\n\nSecond, LUFT conspired with others and attempted to broker illicit arms transactions with, among others, certain Chinese individuals and entities.\u00a0 In his role as a broker or middleman, LUFT worked to find both buyers and sellers of certain weapons and other materials, without a license to do so as required under U.S. law, in violation of the Arms Export Control Act.\u00a0 Among other things, LUFT worked to broker a deal for Chinese companies to sell certain weapons to Libya, including anti-tank launchers, grenade launchers, and mortar rounds (which LUFT and his associates referred to in coded language as \u201ctoys\u201d).\u00a0 LUFT also worked to broker deals for certain weapons to be sold to the United Arab Emirates, including aerial bombs and rockets.\u00a0 LUFT further worked to broker deals for certain weapons to be sold by a Chinese company to Kenya, including unmanned aerial vehicles (\u201cUAVs\u201d) \u2013 and specifically \u201cstrike\u201d UAVs, which LUFT acknowledged \u201c[t]he US doesn\u2019t want to sell[, . . .] hence the opportunity.\u201d\u00a0 LUFT also discussed brokering a deal for weapons to Qatar and told CC-1 that Israel was \u201cnot a good fit\u201d as the middleman for the deal because it had the \u201c[s]ame problem the [] Q [i.e., Qataris] have w uncle [i.e., the United States].\u00a0 Need a third party.\u00a0 . . .\u00a0 I will activate.\u201d\u00a0 In his role as a broker for illicit arms deals, LUFT worked on a commission basis and traveled to meetings and received and passed on documentation needed to secure the deals.\u00a0 During a voluntary interview with U.S. law enforcement in which he was asked questions about his involvement in arms trafficking, LUFT made multiple false statements, including that he had not sought to engage in or profit from arms deals.\n\nThird, LUFT conspired with others and attempted to broker deals for Iranian oil \u2013 which he directed an associate to refer to as \u201cBrazilian\u201d oil in an effort to conceal the activity and evade sanctions \u2013 in violation of U.S. sanctions against Iran and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\u00a0 In his role as a broker or middleman, LUFT solicited buyers and passed on pricing and other information.\u00a0 One offer letter for Iranian oil that LUFT received noted that the \u201corigin\u201d of the oil was \u201cIranian / It can be presented as UAE origin without Iranian papers.\u201d\u00a0 He also assisted in setting up meetings between Iranian representatives and a Chinese energy company for the purpose of discussing oil deals.\u00a0 During a voluntary interview with U.S. law enforcement in which he was asked about his role brokering deals in Iranian oil, LUFT made multiple false statements, including that he had tried to prevent oil deals with Iran and had not been present during meetings with the Chinese energy company and Iranians.\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0

            "article_text": "On April 23, 2015, a federal jury convicted a naturalized U.S. citizen and former Iranian national of violations of U.S. export and money laundering laws, arising from his involvement in a scheme to purchase marine navigation equipment and military electronic equipment for illegal export to, and end-use in, Iran.\n\nThe defendant, Arash Ghahreman, of Staten Island, New York, was convicted of: (1) attempted export to Iran, and conspiracy to do the same, in violation of the Iran Trade Embargo (formerly known as the Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations); (2) smuggling goods from the United States, and conspiracy to the same; and (3) aiding and abetting the transfer of money from Dubai to the United States, in support of an illegal export activity, and conspiracy to do the same.  The case involved a seven-day jury trial, beginning on April 13, 2015, and ending on April 23, 2015, when the jury returned a guilty verdict on seven counts of a nine-count indictment, after one day of deliberation.  The jury was unable to reach a verdict on the two remaining two counts involving the attempted exportation and smuggling of a fiber optic gyrocompass, used in both military and civilian marine navigation applications.\n\nThe evidence presented at trial showed that Ghahreman acted an agent of an Iranian procurement network which used a front company in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (\u201cUAE\u201d), to acquire U.S. goods and technologies for illegal transshipment to, and end-use in, Iran.  Codefendant Koorush Taherkhani (\u201cTaherkhani\u201d), an Iranian national and resident, was the managing director and founder of that front company, codefendant TIG Marine Engineering Services (\u201cTIG Marine\u201d).  Because of his German nationality, codefendant Ergun Yildiz, a resident of UAE, was hired by Taherkhani to be the \u201cface\u201d of the front company, as the President/CEO of TIG Marine.  Before Ghahreman immigrated to the U.S. in 2007, Ghahreman and Taherkhani had been friends and dorm mates at an Iranian University, where each received a degree in marine engineering.  Upon graduation, both Ghahreman and Taherkhani worked as engineers for various Iranian shipping companies, including the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines and its subsidiaries.  After immigrating to the United States, Ghahreman was employed by various shipyards in the U.S., and became a naturalized U.S. citizen.  Because of his employment and citizenship status, Ghahreman was well placed to act as an agent of the illegal procurement network.\n\nFrom December 2012, through June 17, 2013, Ghahreman and his codefendants negotiated, via email, text, telephone and meetings, with Homeland Security Investigations (\u201cHSI\u201d)  and Defense Criminal Investigative Service (\u201cDCIS\u201d) undercover agents to purchase marine navigation components (fiber optic gyrocompasses), military electronic components (electron tubes), and other U.S. technology for illegal export to, and/or end-use in, Iran.  The undercover agents were posing as brokers of U.S. goods and technology, willing to sell U.S. goods to the defendants for end-use in Iran.  Ultimately, as a result of these negotiations, Ghahreman and his codefendants agreed to purchase four (4) Navigat-2100 fiber optic gyrocompasses and fifty (50) Y-690 units (electron tubes).  Pursuant to that agreement, Ghahreman and his codefendants wired approximately $60,000 in partial payment for the gyrocompasses and electron tubes from a bank in Dubai to the undercover agents\u2019 bank account.  Ultimately, on June 17, 2013, HSI agents arrested Ghahreman and Yildiz after they traveled to the U.S. and took partial delivery of one gyrocompass and two electron tubes and attempted to ship the items indirectly to Iran, via third countries.\n\nDefendant Ghahreman is scheduled to be sentenced on July 17, 2015, before the Honorable Dana M. Sabraw.  Codefendant Ergun Yildiz previously pled guilty to conspiracy to export to Iran on October 9, 2014, and is scheduled to be sentenced on May 8, 2015, before Judge Sabraw.  Codefendant Taherkhani, an Iranian national and resident, remains a fugitive.

            "article_text": "\n\n\n\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. \u2014 The second annual Sacramento Region Diversity Career Fair, held on Sept. 30, 2023, connected employers with diverse legal candidates for future and current job openings. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of California, the University of the Pacific McGeorge School of Law, the UC Davis School of Law, and the Federal Bar Association Sacramento Chapter made the announcement following today\u2019s event.\n\nThe Diversity Career Fair is the first legal career fair in the Sacramento region with an online platform where employers can post legal jobs and law students and attorneys can submit applications. The Diversity Career Fair grew significantly this year to include 70 participating employers and was expanded to include an interview component. The Diversity Career Fair also provided employers, law students, and attorneys with the opportunity to connect in person, and included a panel discussion featuring federal and state court judges and the Circuit Executive for the U.S. Courts for the Ninth Circuit. A wide variety of employers, bar associations, law students, attorneys, and judges attended the Diversity Career Fair held at McGeorge School of Law campus.\n\n\u201cThe Sacramento Region Diversity Career Fair has been groundbreaking, and its successful expansion has strengthened our legal community and commitment to diversity,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Phillip A. Talbert. \u201cWe are committed to making the Sacramento Region Diversity Career Fair an annual program to continue this important work with our law schools, bar associations, and the larger legal community.\u201d\n\n\u201cMcGeorge is pleased and honored to be hosting the second annual Sacramento Region Diversity Career Fair, and we cannot thank the participating employers enough,\u201d said Michael Hunter Schwartz, Dean of McGeorge School of Law. \u201cA majority of our students at McGeorge are members of marginalized racial and ethnic identities, making the Diversity Career Fair not only a vital step towards fostering a better legal profession but also providing our student body with invaluable opportunities to connect with employers who share our commitment to our students and the needs of California\u2019s diverse communities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Sacramento Region Diversity Career Fair provided a wonderful opportunity for our students to connect with employers who prioritize diversity in the legal profession,\u201d UC Davis School of Law Dean Kevin R. Johnson said. \u201cWe were so pleased to participate and continue to advance the principles of diversity, equity and inclusion that are the foundation of our school.

            "article_text": "Remarks as Prepared for Delivery\n\nThank you, to the Cybersecurity Coalition and the Cyber Threat Alliance, for the invitation to speak at CyberNext DC.\n\nWhen I was preparing my remarks, I noticed that the theme of the conference is \u201cPrivacy, Partnerships, Protection.\u201d That\u2019s a helpful framework for my remarks today, because I want to talk about all three of those.\n\nProtection\n\nI will start with protection, which is at the core of law enforcement\u2019s mission. Investigating crimes, building cases, and holding individuals, entities, and even nations, accountable, is a large part of how the Justice Department protects the public and contributes to cybersecurity.\n\nIt is fairly straightforward why: criminal prosecution is a means of reinforcing the difference between right and wrong, between acceptable state behavior, on the one hand, and that which violates accepted norms of conduct on the Internet.\n\nAnd imposing consequences, whether through imprisonment, fines or sanctions, or other tools, is a way of deterring malicious conduct, by raising its costs (personal, reputational, financial, and otherwise). As the First Pillar of the Administration\u2019s recent National Cyber Strategy puts it, \u201cLaw enforcement actions to combat criminal cyber activity serve as an instrument of national power by, among other things, deterring those activities.\u201d\n\nThe last year has seen significant prosecutions of foreign hackers, including those acting on behalf of foreign governments, for computer intrusions and attacks. It is worth recounting some of them, for what they show about the Department\u2019s priorities and the lengths we will go in doing our part to enforce the law and protect the public.\n\nBoyusec\n\nIn October 2017, the Department announced charges against three Chinese nationals and residents who worked for a purported Internet security firm known as Guangzhou Bo Yu Information Technology Company Limited (a/k/a \u201cBoyusec\u201d).\n\nThe defendants are accused of computer hacking and trade secret theft between December 2015 and March 2016. Among other things, the indictment alleges they stole a prominent economist\u2019s e-mail messages and trade secrets related to global navigation technology that \u201chad no military application,\u201d but was marketed to construction, land survey, and agricultural sectors.\n\nNow, the Indictment does not allege action by the Chinese state. But what made the defendants\u2019 alleged trade secret theft notable (besides the fact that they worked for a firm that marketed its cybersecurity services), was that it continued after China committed in September 2015 (1) not to steal trade secrets or confidential business information \u201cwith the intent of providing competitive advantages\u201d to its own companies, and (2) to cooperate with requests to investigate cybercrimes emanating from its territory, which this did.\n\nThe September 2015 commitment ushered in broad, public acceptance of a norm against computer espionage for economic benefit (soon accepted by all of the other members of the G-20). And it was incumbent on the U.S. government to hold China to the commitments it made.\n\nAs we previously revealed, the Boyusec indictment was returned under seal, while we sought China\u2019s assistance in investigating and putting a stop to Boyusec\u2019s activities.\u00a0 When we received \u201cno meaningful response\u201d to those requests, there was no longer a basis to keep the charges sealed, and we made them public.\n\nThereafter, the U.S. Trade Representative cited the Boyusec indictment in its March 2018 study of China\u2019s trade practices under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which concluded that a combination of China\u2019s practices are unreasonable, including its outbound investment policies and sponsorship of unauthorized computer intrusions.\n\nIn this way, you can draw a direct line from the DOJ\u2019s indictment of China\u2019s military officers in 2014, through China\u2019s commitments in 2015, to our monitoring for compliance with those commitments, and this Administration\u2019s response to China\u2019s economic aggression, which includes state-sponsored theft of intellectual property.\n\nMabna Institute\n\nIn March of 2018, the Department announced charges against nine Iranian nationals associated with the Mabna Institute in Iran for a massive coordinated hacking campaign that targeted intellectual property and other research at more than 300 colleges and universities around the world.\n\nThe very purpose of the Mabna Institute, according to the indictment, was to assist Iranian universities and scientific and research organizations obtain access to scientific resources outside Iran. It contracted with the Iranian government (including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.) as well as private organizations, and it sold some of the stolen data on websites marketed to Iranian customers.\n\nThe indictment alleges the campaign was executed in three phases:\n\n\n\nOver the course of four years, the Mabna Institute and these nine individuals are accused of stealing more than 31 terabytes of academic data, intellectual property, and communications.\u00a0 That amounts to 7.75 trillion sheets of paper. (And that\u2019s printing double-sided.) U.S. universities had collectively spent $3.4 billion to have access to that intellectual property.\n\nThe charges themselves virtually guarantee the defendants cannot leave Iran without arrest. And on the day they were announced, the Department of the Treasury, leveraging our investigation, sanctioned the Mabna Institute and the defendants \u201cfor engaging in malicious cyber-enabled activities related to the significant misappropriation of economic resources or personal identifiers for private financial gain,\u201d under a provision of Executive Order 13694 (2015).\n\nDPRK\n\nIn September, the Department unsealed a massive complaint, outlining some of the government\u2019s proof behind its prior, higher-level attribution that North Korea launched a destructive malware attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014, stole $81 million from the Bank of Bangladesh in 2016 (and attempted to steal at least $1 billion from other banks), and created the malware used in the WannaCry 2.0 global ransomware attack last year.\n\nThe complaint lays out more than 170 pages of evidence that a single conspiracy, backed by the North Korean government, was responsible for those crimes among others, and it identifies one of the men who was a member of that conspiracy.\n\nAs the complaint makes clear, however, the U.S. government was not alone in this investigation.\u00a0 The complaint cites to security researchers whose expertise and dogged pursuit of the threat was critical to the allegations of the complaint. Our investigative efforts not only validate theirs, they yield specific information that expanded the security community\u2019s understanding of the Lazarus Group (a popular name for the intrusion set) and how best to protect against it.\n\nUSADA, et al.\n\nFinally, this brings me to this morning\u2019s announcement of an indictment in Pittsburgh (where the first public national security cyber case was unsealed in 2014).\n\nA grand jury there has indicted seven Russian GRU officers with an international hacking conspiracy targeting international anti-doping organizations, among others.\n\nAmong the conspiracy\u2019s goals: to publicize stolen information as part of an influence and disinformation campaign designed to undermine, retaliate against, and otherwise delegitimize those organizations, which had publicly exposed Russia\u2019s state-sponsored athlete doping program; and to damage the reputations of athletes around the world by falsely claiming that such athletes were using banned or performance-enhancing drugs.\n\nThe indictment also alleges how, when the efforts to obtain remote access failed to achieve their objectives, the GRU sent several of the defendants to locations where their targets were physically located. Then, using specialized equipment, those close access teams hacked the WiFi networks used by the victim organizations or their personnel (like hotel networks where they were staying).\n\nThere are some who question this approach, of criminally investigating and charging hackers sponsored by foreign states, often because we have not yet arrested the defendants I have described above.\n\nIt is probably easy to forget that, until relatively recently, such charges were unheard of, because for a long time, we viewed the problem of foreign state-sponsored hacking through the lens of intelligence collection alone, without regard to disruption and deterrence (which are our objectives in confronting terrorism, espionage, and other challenging national security threats).\n\nBut imagine a world in which there arenocriminal charges, no detailed, formal allegation of wrongdoing (which the government is prepared to stand behind in court). The private sector would be left alone to accuse the guilty, without recourse.\u00a0 What message doesthatsend to a foreign hacker?\n\nCertainly not the same message we have sent to Karim Baratov, the 23-year-old hacker who worked with FSB officers to hack into e-mail accounts around the world, who was recently sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment after being arrested in Canada and waiving extradition.\u00a0 Or to Ardit Firizi, the Kosovar who was arrested in Malaysia, pled guilty here, and was sentenced to 20 years in prison, for giving ISIS PII for 1,300 military and government personnel, which he stole from the network of a U.S. retailer. Or to countless other hackers arrested on purely criminal charges, who thought they were safe from the consequences for their actions, because they operated under regimes that ignored (if not sponsored) their crimes.\n\nAnd even in the cases above (where we have yet to apprehend a defendant), the charges were never the end of the story: whether it is trade remedies, sanctions, contributions to network defense, or diplomatic efforts to rally likeminded nations to confront an adversary together, all of those charges served a greater purpose.\n\nPrivacy\n\nSo often, privacy is spoken about as if it is a value opposed to law enforcement. But each of the cases I described vindicates the right to privacy, whether it is the right of a company to control who has access to its trade secrets, or of professors to prevent their hard-earned research from being stolen, preempted, and plagiarized; the expectation of privacy we have in our e-mail communications or our medical records.\n\nPrivacy isn\u2019t dead, but it is under attack, and much of what we are doing through law enforcement honors the privacy of innocent persons, by investigating those who would breach it. As the Sony case as well as the GRU cases illustrate, data breaches are not just trees that fall in forests when no one else is around; their consequences are often painfully visible to their victims (and the rest of the world).\n\nBut leaving aside these examples of DOXing, I want to shift gears for a moment, to talk about the Department of Justice\u2019s changing approach to personal privacy, and why the privacy of your personal information can be a matter of national security.\n\nThis portion of my remarks comes from a different vantage point, from my experience with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (or CFIUS), where I represent the Department.\n\nNow CFIUS, for those of you who are not familiar, is a committee of federal departments that reviews foreign acquisitions of U.S. businesses for national security risk. When it finds risks that cannot be mitigated, it recommends actions to the President, who has the authority to prohibit a transaction.\n\nCFIUS does not review the vast majority of foreign investments in the United States. Even among those transactions we do review, we usually conclude that there are no unresolved national security concern.\n\nA classic example of the risk CFIUS examines arises when the target of an acquisition is in close proximity to a DOD facility. But an increasing focus of DOJ\u2019s work on the committee relates to data security, to the potential national security consequences of personal information ending up in the wrong hands. The kind of information I am talking about is collected every day, from thousands or even millions of consumers. Transaction information, PII, health information, even smartphone habits.\n\nNow you might ask why the security of that kind of consumer data would be relevant to CFIUS, whose mission is to protect national security. And ten years ago, or so, such information did not seem like it would be. But a few things have changed.\n\nFirst, the volume and variety of data has increased exponentially. Information that was not previously stored in a digital form now is. And the rate at which data are being created, the velocity of data growth, is increasing.\n\nConsider the increasing connectedness of physical devices and sensors, often referred to as the Internet of Things. Everything from medical devices, such as pacemakers, to fitness trackers, to the control systems that deliver water and power to our businesses and homes. One estimate predicts the number of Internet-connected devices will reach more than 20 billion by 2020.\u00a0 These Internet-connected devices have increased the volume, variety, and velocity of information.\n\nTake cars, for example. Not long ago, a car was essentially a mechanical device, an engine with seats that moved you from point A to point B. Whatever limited electronic components it had were self-contained.\n\nToday\u2019s cars, by contrast, contain communication devices, sensors, GPS navigation, and other computers with a variety of functions. They allow drivers to check fuel levels and tire pressure on their cell phones, track a stolen vehicle over the Internet, call for help from the car in an emergency, and access the same entertainment they\u2019re used to enjoying in their home.\n\nAnother example: the universe of health information is rapidly expanding.\u00a0 More people are taking advantage of DNA testing to learn about their health, longevity, paternity, and ancestry.\u00a0 According to one 2017 report, the market for testing has become an $830 million industry. Meanwhile, our smartphones and watches are accruing ever more precise information about our health and habits.\n\nNew forms and pools of data merely add to what has been collected for years, and it remains possible for a determined adversary to steal it, given enough time and resources.\n\nA second insight we have developed is that information that seems unimportant, or purely personal, or irrelevant, can, in fact, be used to threaten national security.\n\nIn January, a 20-year-old Australian student discovered that open source maps of where Fitbit and other fitness device users frequently go could be used to identify military facilities in remote areas.\u00a0 As the Washington Post put it, \u201cIn war zones and deserts in countries such as Iraq and Syria, the heat map becomes almost entirely dark \u2014 except for scattered pinpricks of activity. Zooming in on those areas brings into focus the locations and outlines of known U.S. military bases, as well as other unknown and potentially sensitive sites \u2014 presumably because American soldiers and other personnel are using fitness trackers as they move around.\u201d\n\nSome data might be valuable, in and of themselves, like a military secret or the admin password to an industrial control system. But other data are valuable because they are part of what a hacker or other malicious actor needs to achieve their objective, to get to their target.\n\nThe information a modern car collects provides insight into the users\u2019 network of contacts, entertainment preferences, driving habits, and locations visited on a regular basis.\n\nIn the aggregate, this information provides commercial and cultural insights that might have monetary or other use. But this information about the \u201cpattern of life\u201d of a company\u2019s CEO or government official could also be used to target that individual.\n\nBy themselves, the music you favor, your children\u2019s birthdates, your anniversary, and the addresses you\u2019ve lived at\u2014these are not national security secrets.\n\nBut with that information, a criminal hacker could answer password reset questions or use a password cracker to obtain control of your accounts. And even if it is a personal (as opposed to a professional) account, and I might not care about the last photoyouposted from your vacation, masquerading as you online makes it that much easier to trick the people who know you into clicking on a link or otherwise compromising their network security.\n\nOur third insight is this: the fact that most people in a data set might not be targets themselves (in fact, that only a few might be) provides little comfort. Anyone on any form of social media has learned that we are more connected than it seems. In 2016, Facebook reported that its American users were separated by fewer than 3.5 degrees of separation on average. Extrapolating what that means offline, anyone\u2019s information can be useful more for what it tells us about her brother, the CISO at a major bank, or her aunt in the intelligence community.\n\nOur concerns are exacerbated by the fact that traditional methods of de-identification of data (such as anonymization or encryption of content) may be defeated, by, for example, sensor and geolocation data, or by cross-referencing sanitized data sets against others.\n\nResearchers from two studies several years ago reported that, with a sufficient pool of data, they could distinguish a unique user of a cellphone, or a credit card, based on just four geolocations or transactions, respectively, with at least 90 percent accuracy. I cannot vouch for the methodology of those studies, but they give me pause when I think about the potential that nefarious actors could have access to large pools of such data without legal process.\n\nWhat does this mean for companies, and the way they should think about their data?\n\nFirst, and most important, they should not assume that hackers are not interested in the data or that it cannot be used to threaten national security.\n\nSecond, cybersecurity policies and practices need to keep pace as businesses grow and deploy new technologies, such as biometric identification or artificial intelligence.\n\nThird, joint ventures or other arrangements with foreign parties may provide network access or other elements of control over data. Businesses should consider the ways an aggressive foreign intelligence service could exploit that data,in light of other data it might have from other sources.\n\nFourth, and finally, report computer intrusions, because the breach you think is merely a private matter, may in fact be a matter of national security.\n\nPartnerships\n\nThis brings me to the final theme, partnerships. The cases we bring require true partnerships, between law enforcement and the victims who cooperate with us; between us and the intelligence community and other components of the government; and, increasingly, between our government and the governments of likeminded nations, whether in gathering and sharing information, validating our conclusions, extraditing defendants, or imposing other consequences.\n\nBut as much as I believe in the value of criminal prosecutions, we have always known that we will not prosecute our way to cybersecurity. The partnership that may be most critical to our future is among the professionals in and out of government who share common goals. Which is why one of the National Security Division\u2019s greatest successes this year did not result in a criminal charge.\n\nIn May, agents of the FBI were tracking a virulent botnet infecting home and office routers around the world, attributed to the same group responsible for today\u2019s indictment, known to some as \u201cFancy Bear.\u201d\n\nThe botnet was growing at an alarming rate by that point, and private sector researchers studying it told us they felt an increasing urgency to publish what they knew, so that affected router manufacturers, ISPs, and others could take steps to protect the public before it was too late.\n\nThere was no easy technical solution to this pernicious malware. Its second stage (which could steal information and even brick the device) could be cleared from memory with a simple restart, but if a router were infected, complete mitigation could be virtually impossible, short of replacement, because the first stage of malware (the actors\u2019 toe-hold in the system) would just call out for instructions to reinfect.\n\nWith no time to waste, in little more than a week (including late nights and a weekend), agents and prosecutors devised the best mitigation plan they could under the circumstances.\n\nIn a coordinated action,\n\nResearchers drew attention to the botnet at the same time that the FBI executed the orders and blasted out a public service advisory to restart your router, purging the second stage of malware and causing the first stage to call out for instructions, now to the FBI\u2019s server, so that help could be alerted. These efforts were our best effort to identify and remediate the infection worldwide in the time available, before Fancy Bear actors learned of the vulnerabilities in the C2 infrastructure through the research firm\u2019s imminent announcement.\n\nLast week, Cisco Talos, the research firm I mentioned, published a follow-up to its original report. It found that the VPNFilter malware possessed even greater capabilities than previously identified, in the form of third-stage malware modules that provide additional capabilities to map networks, exploit systems connected to infected devices, and obfuscate or encrypt malicious traffic.\n\nBut Cisco Talos also reported, based on information from partners as well as its own analysis, that \u201cit appears that VPNFilter has been entirely neutralized since\u201d the effort I described earlier by a coalition of international partners (which included the Cyber Threat Alliance). So far, they said, there have been no signs of the actors attempting to reconnect with the devices that remain infected with the pernicious first stage of the malware. Not bad, for the first (but I promise you, not the last) effort to mitigate a botnet tied to nation-state actors.\n\nOnce, there was no one. Attribution was whispered in classified channels alone. We spoke, haltingly at first, of cyber threats \u201cemanating from Asia.\u201d Then the U.S. led the way, calling out the malicious behavior of specific foreign states, first in speeches, then by indictment.\n\nToday, we are joined by three other nations in attributing specific conduct to Russia.\n\nI cannot tell you where our commitment to partnership will take us next. But I can tell you, based on this, that there is reason for hope, and to continue working together to maintain an \u201copen, interoperable, reliable, and secure Internet.\u201d",

            "article_text": "Deirdre M. Daly, United  States Attorney for the District of Connecticut, and Assistant Attorney General  for National Security John P. Carlin announced that MOZAFFAR KHAZAEE, 60,  formerly of Manchester, Connecticut, pleaded guilty today before U.S. District  Judge Vanessa L. Bryant in Hartford to violating the Arms Export Control Act, in connection with  his efforts to send to Iran  sensitive, proprietary, trade secret and export controlled material relating to  military jet engines for the U.S. Air Force\u2019s F35 Joint Strike Fighter program  and the F-22 Raptor program, which he had stolen from defense contractors where  he had previously been employed.\n\n\u201cWhile  employed with U.S. defense contractors, Mozaffar Khazaee stole sensitive,  proprietary and controlled technology to send it to Iran,\u201d said U.S. Attorney  Daly.\u00a0 \u201cThe illegal export of our  military technology compromises U.S. national security and reduces the advantages  our armed forces currently possess.\u00a0\u00a0 As  today\u2019s case demonstrates, we will aggressively investigate and hold  accountable those who attempt to steal trade secrets and sensitive military  technology from U.S. industries, whether for their own personal gain or for the  benefit of foreign actors.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s guilty plea demonstrates the ongoing  cooperation with our federal law enforcement partners to prevent U.S.  technology from falling into the wrong hands,\u201d said Bruce Foucart, special agent in charge of HSI Boston.\u00a0 \u201cAcross the globe, the magnitude and scope of  threats facing the United States has never been greater, and that's why one of  Homeland Security Investigations highest priorities is to prevent illicit  procurement networks, terrorist groups and hostile nations from illegally  obtaining U.S. military products and sensitive dual-use technologies.\u00a0 Homeland Security Investigations takes pride  in protecting our country, and today\u2019s guilty plea is the latest example of our  effective investigative efforts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis joint investigation has emphasized the  need for American companies to remain vigilant against the theft of valuable  and sensitive technologies,\u201d said FBI Special Agent in Charge Patricia M.  Ferrick.\u00a0 \u201cAs our nation continues to  lead the way in research and development, we are constantly reminded that there  are those who seek to advance their own causes by stealing the hard work of  others, and we owe it to ourselves and to the American public to guard against  it. The FBI vigorously investigates these matters in cooperation with our law enforcement  partners, both domestic and abroad.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis investigation demonstrates the  dedication of the Department of Defense, Office of the Inspector General,  Defense Criminal Investigative Service and our federal and military partners to  ensure that critical technology is not exploited by criminals acting on behalf  of governments hostile to the U.S.,\u201d said Craig W. Rupert, Special Agent in  Charge, Defense Criminal Investigative Service, Northeast Field Office.\u00a0 \u201cForeign governments continue to actively seek  U.S. military technology in an effort to advance their own military  development.\u00a0 Today\u2019s plea represents our  continuing efforts to safeguard sensitive technology and to shield America\u2019s  investment in national defense by thwarting those who try to illegally acquire  our national security assets.\u201d\n\nAccording to court documents and statements made in court, at different  times between 2001 and 2013, KHAZAEE was employed by three separate defense  contractors.\u00a0 From at least 2009 through  and including late 2013, KHAZAEE attempted to use trade secret, proprietary and  export controlled material that he had obtained from his employers to gain  employment in Iran.\n\nIn November and December 2009, KHAZAEE corresponded by email with an  individual in Iran to whom he attempted to send, and in some cases did send,  documents containing trade secret, proprietary and export controlled material  relating to the Joint Strike Fighter Program.\u00a0  In one email KHAZAEE wrote \u201csome of these are very controlled . . . and  I am taking [a] big risk.\u00a0 Again please  after downloading these two Power Point files delete everything  immediately.\u201d\n\nAnalysis of KHAZAEE\u2019s computer media revealed not only additional  documents containing proprietary, trade secret and export controlled material  belonging to the U.S. defense contractors at which he had been employed, but  also cover letters and application documents, dating from in or about 2009  through in or about 2013, in which KHAZAEE sought employment with multiple  state-controlled technical universities in Iran.\u00a0 In multiple letters KHAZAEE described the  knowledge and skills he had obtained while working for the U.S. defense  contractors and wrote:\u00a0 \u201c[a]s lead  engineer in these projects I have learned some of the key technique[s] that  could be transferred to our own industry and universities.\u201d\u00a0 KHAZAEE stated that he was \u201clooking for an  opportunity to work in Iran, and . . . transferring my skill and knowledge to  my nation.\u201d\n\nIn or about November 2013, while residing in Connecticut, KHAZAEE caused  a shipment to be sent by truck from Connecticut to a freight forwarder located  in Long Beach, California, which was intended for shipment to Iran.\u00a0 The shipment included numerous boxes and  digital media containing thousands of documents consisting of sensitive  technical manuals, specification sheets, technical drawings and data, and other  proprietary material relating to military jet engines and the United States Air  Force\u2019s F35 Joint Strike Fighter (\u201cJSF\u201d) program and the F-22 Raptor.\u00a0 Many documents were labeled as  \u201cExport-Controlled,\u201d as well as stamped with \u201cITAR-controlled\u201d warnings.\u00a0 KHAZAEE did not apply for nor did he obtain  any export license or written authorization to export any of the documents, and  the export or attempted export of such material to Iran is illegal.\n\nOn January 9, 2014, KHAZAEE was arrested at the Newark Liberty  International Airport before boarding a flight with a final destination of  Iran.\u00a0 Search warrants executed on  KHAZAEE\u2019s checked and carry-on luggage revealed additional sensitive,  proprietary, trade secret and export controlled documents relating to military  jet engines, in both hard copy and in electronic form on KHAZAEE\u2019s computer  media.\u00a0 KHAZAEE has been detained since  that time.\n\nJudge Bryant scheduled  sentencing proceedings for May 20, 2015, at which time KHAZAEE faces up to 20  years in prison and a $1 million fine.\n\nThis investigation is being led by the United States Department of  Homeland Security\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations in New Haven, in  coordination with the New Haven Division of the Federal Bureau of  Investigation, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service in New Haven and the Department of Commerce\u2019s Boston Office of Export Enforcement.\n\nU.S. Attorney Daly and  Assistant Attorney General Carlin also commended the efforts of the many other  agencies and offices that were involved in this investigation, including U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices for the Central  District of California, the Southern District of Indiana and the District of  New Jersey, Homeland Security Investigations in Los Angeles, the U.S. Customs  and Border Protection Service in Los Angeles, the U.S. Air Force\u2019s Office of  Special Investigations in Los Angeles and Boston,\u00a0 as well as HSI, CBP, and FBI in New Jersey,  and HSI, FBI and DCIS in Indianapolis.\n\nThis case is being prosecuted by  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Stephen Reynolds and Krishna Patel of the National  Security and Major Crimes Unit of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District  of Connecticut, and Trial Attorney Brian Fleming of the Justice Department\u2019s  Counterespionage Section (CES).\n\nPUBLIC AFFAIRS CONTACT:\n\nU.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICETom Carson(203)

            "article_text": "A federal grand jury in Spokane, Washington, returned an indictment earlier this month charging two hackers, both nationals and residents of the People\u2019s Republic of China (China), with hacking into the computer systems of hundreds of victim companies, governments, non-governmental organizations, and individual dissidents, clergy, and democratic and human rights activists in the United States and abroad, including Hong Kong and China. \u00a0The defendants in some instances acted for their own personal financial gain, and in others for the benefit of the MSS or other Chinese government agencies.\u00a0 The hackers stole terabytes of data which comprised a sophisticated and prolific threat to U.S. networks.\n\nThe 11-count indictment alleges LI Xiaoyu (\u674e\u5578\u5b87), 34, and DONG Jiazhi (\u8463\u5bb6\u5fd7), 33, who were trained in computer applications technologies at the same Chinese university, conducted a hacking campaign lasting more than ten years to the present, targeting companies in countries with high technology industries, including the United States, Australia, Belgium, Germany, Japan, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Spain, South Korea, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.\u00a0 Targeted industries included, among others, high tech manufacturing; medical device, civil, and industrial engineering; business, educational, and gaming software; solar energy; pharmaceuticals; defense. \u00a0In at least one instance, the hackers sought to extort cryptocurrency from a victim entity, by threatening to release the victim\u2019s stolen source code on the Internet.\u00a0 More recently, the defendants probed for vulnerabilities in computer networks of companies developing COVID-19 vaccines, testing technology, and treatments.\n\nThe charges were announced by Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers; FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich; U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Washington William D. Hyslop; and Special Agent in Charge of the FBI\u2019s Seattle Field Division\u00a0 Raymond Duda.\n\n\u201cChina has now taken its place, alongside Russia, Iran and North Korea, in that shameful club of nations that provide a safe haven for cyber criminals in exchange\u00a0for those criminals being \u2018on call\u2019 to work for the benefit of the state, here to feed the Chinese Communist party\u2019s insatiable hunger for American and other non-Chinese companies\u2019 hard-earned intellectual property, including COVID-19 research,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s indictment demonstrates the serious consequences the Chinese MSS and its proxies will face if they continue to deploy malicious cyber tactics to either steal what they cannot create or silence what they do not want to hear,\u201d said FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich. \u201cCybercrimes directed by the Chinese government\u2019s intelligence services not only threaten the United States but also every other country that supports fair play, international norms, and the rule of law, and it also seriously undermines China's desire to become a respected leader in world affairs. The FBI and our international partners will not stand idly by to this threat, and we are committed to holding the Chinese government accountable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe cybercrime hacking occurring here was first discovered on computers of the Department of Energy\u2019s Hanford Site in Eastern Washington.\u00a0 As the grand jury charged, the computer systems of many businesses, individuals and agencies throughout the United States and worldwide have been hacked and compromised with a huge array of sensitive and valuable trade secrets, technologies, data, and personal information being stolen.\u00a0 The hackers operated from China both for their own gain and with the assistance and for the benefit of the Chinese government\u2019s Ministry of State Security.\u00a0 This prosecution is occurring as a result of the combined unwavering efforts of the National Security Division of the Department of Justice, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Washington, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\u00a0 We seek justice for these victims and others affected and we intend to prosecute these defendants for their alleged crimes,\u201d said U.S. Attorney William D. Hyslop for the District Eastern District of Washington.\n\n\"The complicated nature of cyber investigations is only exacerbated when the criminal is backed by the resources of a foreign government. The nature and value of the material stolen by these hackers cannot just be measured in dollars and was indicative of being state driven. This case demonstrates the FBI's dedication to pursuing these criminals no matter who is sanctioning their activities,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Raymond Duda of the FBI\u2019s Seattle Division.\n\nAccording to the indictment, to gain initial access to victim networks, the defendants primarily exploited publicly known software vulnerabilities in popular web server software, web application development suites, and software collaboration programs.\u00a0 In some cases, those vulnerabilities were newly announced, meaning that many users would not have installed patches to correct the vulnerability.\u00a0 The defendants also targeted insecure default configurations in common applications.\u00a0 The defendants used their initial unauthorized access to place malicious web shell programs (e.g., the \u201cChina Chopper\u201d web shell) and credential-stealing software on victim networks, which allowed them to remotely execute commands on victim computers.\n\nTo conceal the theft of information from victim networks and otherwise evade detection, the defendants typically packaged victim data in encrypted Roshal Archive Compressed files (RAR files), changed RAR file and victim documents\u2019 names and extensions (e.g., from \u201c.rar\u201d to \u201c.jpg\u201d) and system timestamps, and concealed programs and documents at innocuous-seeming locations on victim networks and in victim networks\u2019 \u201crecycle bins.\u201d\u00a0 The defendants frequently returned to re-victimize companies, government entities, and organizations from which they had previously stolen data, in some cases years after the initial successful data theft.\u00a0 In several instances, however, the defendants were unsuccessful in this regard, due to the efforts of the FBI and network defenders.\n\nThe indictment charges the defendants with conspiring to steal trade secrets from at least eight known victims, which consisted of technology designs, manufacturing processes, test mechanisms and results, source code, and pharmaceutical chemical structures. \u00a0Such information would give competitors with a market edge by providing insight into proprietary business plans and savings on research and development costs in creating competing products.\n\nThe defendants are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets, which carries a maximum sentence of ten years in prison; one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; one count of unauthorized access of a computer, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; and seven counts of aggravated identity theft, which each carries a mandatory sentence of two non-consecutive years in prison. \u00a0The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencings of the defendants will be determined by the assigned judge.\n\nThe investigation was conducted jointly by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Washington, the National Security Division of the Department of Justice, and the FBI\u2019s Spokane Resident Agency and San Antonio and Norfolk Field Offices.\u00a0 The FBI\u2019s Cyber Division assisted in the investigation and, along with \u00a0FBI\u2019s Cyber Assistant Legal Attach\u00e9s and Legal Attach\u00e9s in countries around the world, provided essential support.\u00a0 Numerous victims cooperated and provided valuable assistance in the investigation.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney James Goeke of the Eastern District of Washington and Trial Attorney Scott McCulloch of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting this case.\n\nThe details contained in the charging document are allegations.\u00a0 The defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.",

            "article_text": "HOUSTON \u2013 U.S. Attorney Alamdar S. Hamdani has announced he will resign as chief law enforcement officer for the Southern District of Texas (SDTX) effective midnight Jan. 19.\n\n\u201cServing as the 24th Presidentially Appointed U.S. Attorney for this incredible district has been the honor of a lifetime,\u201d said Hamdani. \u201cOver the past two years, we have made significant strides across multiple fronts, strengthening our community, upholding justice and ensuring safety for all citizens.\"\n\nHamdani was responsible for prosecuting and defending the interests of the United States in one of the largest districts in the country - covering 44,000 square miles and representing over nine million people. He oversaw over 400 employees, including approximately 200 Assistant U.S. Attorneys who cover the seven offices across the district.\n\nIn just over two years as U.S. Attorney, Hamdani led the office in approximately more than 10 thousand criminal cases against over 12 thousand defendants while maintaining an average 95% conviction rate. From fentanyl to the cartels, crimes involving children to human smuggling and white collar crime to cybercrime, Hamdani worked to ensure justice was served every day and the SDTX was a safe place to live.\n\nThe Civil Division filed more than 2,500 cases in fiscal years 2023-2024, which included a historic$85 million settlementagainst a cardiac imaging company. \u201cPatients deserve care based on their medical need and not on a doctor or company\u2019s financial interest or gain,\u201d Hamdani said. The Texas Medical Center also agreed to pay a record$15 millionfor allegations of concurrent billing claims for critical surgeries.\n\nThe office was at the forefront of numerous new and ongoing issues to include violent crime, which was at record levels when he took office. He made several announcements on numerous cases againstfelons illegally in possession of firearmsto those involvingknown gang members. As part of those efforts, the office partnered with the Department of Justice\u2019s Violent Crime and Racketeering Section as part of the Department\u2019s Violent Crime Initiative which contributed to a reduction in violent crime over the past two years.\n\nHe also worked with the three other Texas U.S. Attorneys in acoordinated announcementon a statewide effort targeting machine gun conversion devices.\n\nHamdani placed particular emphasis on cases linked to Mexican cartels, often noting how their violence spreads into the district. This included a matter out of the Galveston Division which saw thearrest of 23in a poly-drug indictment. Noting that \u201cFentanyl-laced pills disguised as something else are killing our kids,\u201d Hamdani and his office targeted those dealing the drug that destroys lives and families andanyonewho provided it to others. As part of the effort, Hamdani also announced charges against aChinese nationalfor his alleged part in a conspiracy involving the importation of what is believed to be the largest amount of fentanyl precursors - chemicals used to make fentanyl - in the SDTX.\n\nHe also targeted cybercrime, often speaking and participating in numerous conferences on the topic. In one matter of note, the office helped disrupt abotnetthat used hundreds of U.S.-based small office/home office routers so that People\u2019s Republic of China state-sponsored hackers could monitor key parts of American infrastructure.\n\nSpending much of his career prosecuting cases involving national security matters, Hamdani continued that focus as U.S. Attorney, from thoseattempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organizationto another whoallegedly exported U.S. technology to Iran.\n\nHamdani\u2019s office also targeted deadly human smuggling organizations, including a Brownsville matter that saw the conviction of six men who werechargedin an alien smuggling ring which resulted in the death of eight people. To further combat the issue, the office also participated in Joint Task Force Alpha, which the Attorney General created to marshal and combat the rise in prolific and dangerous smuggling and trafficking groups operating in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. And just a few weeks ago, as part of that mission, the officeunsealed chargesagainst several defendants for the death of over 50 migrants in an overturned trailer in Chiapas, Mexico.\n\nA similar issue due to the proximity to the border is human trafficking, and the office continued its efforts to combat this troubling crime throughout the district and provide for victims, such as a woman who received30 yearsfor forcing young girls to engage in commercial sex.\n\nA father himself, Hamdani also sought to make sure those committing crimes against children were held accountable. One such criminal was recently sentenced to100 yearsin prison for raping two children. On the other end of the spectrum, he emphasized protecting the elderly from those who take advantage of them, such as those who tricked a WWII veteran out of $300,000 to many that are involved inIndian call centerswho often target the elderly.\n\nThe office increased efforts to hold those committing white collar crime and health care fraud accountable, such as a Houston man who wasconvictedin a $160M Medicare fraud scheme.\u00a0Another significant matter and a focus of the office was a company charged with violating theForeign Corrupt Practices Actwho agreed to pay $160 million. \u201cProsecuting and investigating this type of crime is an important role our office takes seriously in order to ensure fair and equal playing fields for U.S. companies and consumers,\u201d Hamdani noted.\n\nIn October 2023, Attorney General Merrick Garland picked Hamdani to serve on the Attorney General\u2019s Advisory Committee. Hamdani, along with 13 other U.S. Attorneys, advised the Attorney General on behalf of the U.S. Attorney community. While in this role, he also led the Border and Immigration Law Enforcement Subcommittee which included U.S. Attorneys along the Northern and Southern borders working together to secure both those borders from transnational criminal organizations, cartels, gun, drugs and human smuggling.\n\nDuring his tenure, Hamdani made it a priority to get the news of the office\u2019s important work to the people, so as to inform some and deter others from committing crime. He used multiple platforms, including the use of social media clips, to ensure these messages were heard.\n\nHe is\u00a0proud to have run his office under the \u201cmama rule.\u201d Citing his own mother\u2019s history as a poor migrant and her age, his mantra was that you treat and protect others as you would your own \u201cmama.\u201d\n\nHamdani was the first Asian in Texas that was presidentially appointed and senate confirmed as U.S. Attorney. He was born in England to Indian parents who had moved there from India. The family immigrated to Texas when he was 10. He received his J.D. from the University of Houston Law Center in 1999 and his B.B.A. from the University of Texas at Austin in 1993.\n\nHamdani joined the SDTX in 2014, but has been with the Department of Justice since 2008. As an AUSA with the SDTX, he was primarily responsible for the investigation and prosecution of national security and official corruption crimes. From 2010 to 2014, Hamdani served in the Counterterrorism Section of the Department of Justice\u2019s National Security Division, holding the position of deputy chief from 2012 to 2014. Before that, he was an AUSA in the Eastern District of Kentucky.\n\nPrior to his government service, Hamdani was in private practice.\n\nHe is married and is a proud father of two teenagers, a University of Texas Longhorn and Bellaire High School Cardinal.\n\nAs he departs the office, he is reminded of the privilege he enjoyed to lead a group of dedicated public servants who work every day to make Texas safer, noting that \u201cwe love mercy, walk humbly and always, always, seek justice.\u201d",

            "article_text": "Remarks as prepared for delivery\n\nAMES, IOWA\n\n\n\nThank you for that introduction, [U.S. Attorney] Kevin [Techau].\n\nAnd thank you for inviting me to speak today about the national security threats facing our nation. This event comes on the heels of a landmark week for the department\u2019s national security cyber program, and I want to start by saying a few words about our strategy and recent successes in this space.\n\nFor many years, nation states and their affiliates enjoyed what they perceived to be a cloak of anonymity when acting in cyber space. A cloak they hid behind to break our laws through cyber intrusions and to threaten our security and economic well-being. They had this perceived cloak because they thought we couldn\u2019t figure out who did it and, if we did figure it out, we would keep it a secret.\n\nLast week, we proved yet again \u2013 through a number of law enforcement actions \u2013 that we will find and expose those who threaten our national security through cyber attacks or theft.\n\nFirst and foremost, we unsealed an indictment charging seven experienced Iranian computer hackers for their roles in an extensive campaign of distributed denial of service attacks against the U.S. financial sector.\n\nThe damage was real: 46 major financial institutions attacked over 176 days, hit by as much as 140 Gigabits of data per second, costing the victims tens of millions of dollars.\n\nIn addition, one defendant is also charged with obtaining unauthorized access into the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems of the Bowman Dam, located in Rye, New York. The intrusion could have given the hacker control of the dam\u2019s water levels and flow rates if it had not been disconnected from the system for maintenance.\n\nThese attacks threatened public health and safety, and our economy. And this indictment exposes the faces and names behind the keyboards in Iran used to orchestrate these attacks against us \u2013 the attackers were employed by two computer security companies that work on behalf of the Iranian Government, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\nThat same week, we unsealed a complaint against members of the Syrian Electronic Army, for activity that sought to harm the economic and national security of the United States in the name of Syria and sought to extort law-abiding people all over the world to line their own pockets.\n\nAnd, following a successful extradition from Canada, we convicted a Chinese businessman in Los Angeles for hacking into the computer networks of U.S. defense contractors, including Boeing, and stealing sensitive information, including data related to fighter jets.\n\nLast week\u2019s announcements prove, once again, there is no free pass for nation state affiliated computer intrusions.\n\n\n\nThe Role of the National Security Division\n\nDisrupting these national security threats is among the highest priorities of the Department of Justice and the National Security Division. Let me share a bit of background on the National Security Division, and what our experience combatting the threat of terrorism has taught us about combating other national security threats, including threats to our national assets.\n\nThe September 11thterrorist attacks showed us that putting walls up between foreign intelligence and law enforcement makes connecting the dots of a plot very difficult. So a decade ago, Congress created the department\u2019s first new litigating division in almost half a century, the National Security Division.\n\nWe ensure unity of purpose in the department\u2019s number-one mission \u2013 to protect against terrorism and other threats to our national security. And we unite prosecutors and law enforcement officials with intelligence attorneys and the intelligence community, to ensure that we approach national security threats using every tool and resource available to the federal government.\n\nIn the years since National Security Division\u2019s creation, it is increasingly clear that the factors that motivated our creation and guided our efforts to combat terrorism are equally true in our efforts to protect our valuable national assets.\n\nAs with counterterrorism, we realized that prosecution is only one of the many tools the U.S. government brings to bear. So the National Security Division restructured and adapted to support a whole-of-government approach to national security cyber threats. Criminal prosecutions, sanctions, trade pressure and diplomatic options are just some of the responses available to us as we combat online threats to the national security.\n\nUnderlying all of the government\u2019s policy options is the need for attribution \u2013 to attribute online intrusions with confidence, down to the country, government agency, organization or even individuals involved.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies and the Department of Justice are uniquely well suited for these kinds of investigations. And these investigations are the bedrock of our whole-of-government approach because they facilitate the use of so many other tools that promote deterrence.\n\nIn some cases, attribution leads to public charges and a criminal prosecution. In other cases, a prosecution may not be the right option, but attribution opens the door for sanctions, disruption operations and bilateral diplomacy.\n\nOur attorneys live by that whole-of-government approach. \u00a0We work with our government partners to pick the best tool or combination of tools to get the job done under the rule of law.\n\nWe ensure that we have the necessary expertise no matter who is behind the threat, what their motivation is or what tool we need to use.\n\nUnder unified NSD leadership, we have integrated the department\u2019s full range of national security expertise under one roof, bringing varied skills and knowledge to the full range of national security challenges.\n\n\n\nThe Threats to our National Assets\n\nThe threat landscape we face is ever-changing and evolving, and while our top priority remains combating terrorism, we have also sharpened our focus and increased our attention on the emerging threats to our national assets, including the threat of economic espionage.\n\nAnd we have seen that these threats are not confined to banks in New York or defense contractors in California. Our entire nation, including America\u2019s heartland here in Iowa, is under constant attack from foreign adversaries and competitors who try to steal trade secrets and other intellectual property, at the expense of our economy and national security.\n\nWhen certain foreign entities eager for sensitive and valuable information can\u2019t buy it, they may take another approach: they try to steal it. Corporate theft can occur through insiders employed by a company \u2013 or it can occur remotely, through cyber intrusions that exploit a vulnerability present in a company\u2019s networks. Companies must be ready for all of these vectors of vulnerability.\n\nIowa is a fitting place to address these topics. Iowa\u2019s agricultural and food production, renewable energy, biotechnology and advanced manufacturing are an integral part of the country\u2019s economic engine. Between 2002 and 2011, Iowa\u2019s agricultural production grew over 200 percent. This growth is attributable in part to the tremendous innovation that is taking place\n\nin the American agriculture sector. According to one government study, agricultural biotech accounts for $80 billion of a $260 billion biotechnology sector.\n\nYou are revolutionizing the way America grows crops. You invest in biotechnology research to develop higher-yielding, drought-resistant crops. You rely on data from sophisticated soil sensors, satellites and drones to optimize the use of water and pesticides.\n\nBut, while you spend your days innovating, others spend their days on campaigns to steal the fruits of Americans\u2019 labor.\n\nJust this year, here in Iowa, Mo Hailong, a lawful permanent resident and employee of a China-based seed company, was convicted of participating in a long-term conspiracy to steal trade secrets from DuPont Pioneer and Monsanto, for the purpose of covertly transferring the technology to China.\n\nHailong and his co-conspirators brazenly stole inbred corn seeds from production fields not far from here. Although he knew that this technology was the valuable and confidential intellectual property of DuPont Pioneer and Monsanto, he stole it for the benefit of his China-based company.\n\nThe threat of this kind of economic espionage is serious. Some estimate that, every year, the U.S. loses more than $300 billion from theft of our intellectual property. That figure is about equivalent to the current annual level of U.S. exports to Asia. Losses of that magnitude cost the American economy untold numbers of jobs.\n\nThey reduce the profit that American firms make from research and development, which in turn reduces the incentives and resources for innovation. And the activity undermines the trust between countries and companies that is necessary to do business in a globalized economy.\n\nAs companies move to digital storage, economic espionage increasingly occurs not just through insider threats but also through cyber activity. As a result of the proliferation of technology \u2013 and the myriad ways to exploit it \u2013 we face a changing world order in which lone hackers, organized crime syndicates and nation states are all increasingly able to harm our shared networks and our livelihood. Every sector of the economy is a target \u2013 agriculture, energy, financial institutions, infrastructure, entertainment and more.\n\nAnd hackers come in all shapes and sizes. We have seen state and non-state actors using the Internet to steal our intellectual property and export-controlled information at unprecedented levels.\n\nFor example, in May 2014, after a lengthy investigation, the department indicted five Chinese military officers by name for computer hacking, economic espionage and other offenses directed at American companies. The indictment describes numerous and specific instances where uniformed officers of the People's Liberation Army hacked into the computer systems of American nuclear power, metals and solar-products companies to steal trade secrets and sensitive, internal communications that could be used by Chinese companies to give them a commercial leg-up.\n\nThe investigation, and the public charges it led to, have had a lasting impact. At the time, our indictment was met with indignant denials. But a year later, after rumors circulated that additional costs might be imposed, Chinese President Xi Jinping publicly declared, during his state visit in September, that, \u201cChina strongly opposes and combats the theft of commercial secrets and other kinds of hacking attacks.\u201d The United States and China committed that neither country\u2019s government will conduct, or knowingly support, cyber-enabled theft of trade secrets or confidential business information with the intent of providing competitive advantage to companies or commercial sectors.\n\nAnd, at the G20 Summit last fall, leaders of the world\u2019s most powerful nations pledged not to conduct or support cyber economic espionage. What began with denials ended, at least for now, with a shift in international norms and a commitment from China to change its behavior.\n\nOf course, indictments of state-sponsored hackers will not, on their own, prevent all cyber theft. This is the very point of an all-tools, whole-of-government approach. We need to exert pressure on bad actors from every possible angle. Prosecutions are just one tool in the broader Justice Department approach, which is just one angle from which the U.S. can pressure nation-state actors. The ultimate success of this approach will depend on the ability of U.S. agencies and departments to strengthen and support one another\u2019s actions.\n\nWe will not stand idly by as others attempt to steal from us. We will hold them accountable \u2013 no matter who they are, where they are or the means by which they steal.\n\n\n\nPublic-Private Partnership\n\nBut we cannot do it alone. Your companies \u2013 and thus, you, have a critical role to play.\n\nIn the case of Hailong, the investigation was initiated when DuPont Pioneer security staff detected suspicious activity and alerted the FBI. DuPont Pioneer and Monsanto cooperated fully throughout the investigation, and that cooperation was essential to disrupt the theft of American technology and hold the perpetrator accountable.\n\nAs leaders in your industries, you are on the front lines defending your companies\u2019 valuable intellectual property against insider threats, cyber-attacks and other bad actors determined to erode America\u2019s status as a global leader in those fields.\n\nWe know from experience that those seeking to do us harm will look for any available vulnerability to exploit. In many cases, your adversaries have the full backing of their foreign governments and so should you.\n\nAs a nation, we must work together to deter and disrupt these threats, and to change our adversaries\u2019 calculus by increasing their cost. Our strategy must ensure there is no free pass.\n\nBut the government\u2019s response is only one half of the equation. We need your help. Our nation\u2019s crown jewels are overwhelmingly in private sector hands. And so we work with U.S. companies, across all industry sectors, to ensure that our national security interests are protected.\n\nWe have spent time and energy in face-to-face sit downs so that we may better understand the concerns and challenges facing U.S. companies, share guidance and information, and assist with protection, detection, attribution and response. We can warn companies that manufacture or sell targeted U.S. technology when certain bad actors are seeking the particular technology they make.\n\nCorporate outreach sensitizes industry to the threat they face and helps to stem the flow of sensitive technology out of the United States.\n\nThis type of cooperation is especially important with respect to cyber-enabled threats. After all, the Internet runs on private infrastructure and the hardware and software that we all use \u2013 including in the government \u2013 is developed and maintained by the private sector.\n\nAfter an attack, if an organization works with law enforcement, it puts both in the best possible position to find out exactly what happened and to remediate and prevent further damage. The evidence is often fleeting, so early notification and access to the data is extremely important.\n\nIn addition, we may have seen the same indicators of malicious activity in other attacks, so we can conclude who was responsible and identify possible impacts and means of remediation. \u00a0Importantly, it also allows us to share information with other potential victims. \u00a0One organization\u2019s vulnerability is everyone\u2019s vulnerability and it is critical that we work together.\n\nLaw enforcement may be able to use legal authorities and tools that are unavailable to non-governmental entities. Law enforcement can also enlist the assistance of international partners to locate stolen data or identify a perpetrator.\n\nThese tools and relationships can greatly increase the odds of successfully apprehending an intruder or attacker and securing lost data. Finally, this cooperation is vital to successful prosecutions that, as I explained, can prevent criminals from causing further damage to victim companies and others.\n\nA united front is critical because the threat you face includes hackers with the full backing of their governments or that are part of sophisticated, international criminal syndicates. They have backup, but so do you \u2013 because your government is here to help.\n\nLast year, we announced a new position within the National Security Division focused on outreach to the private sector. This position was created in recognition of the importance of relationships and cooperation in cybersecurity. We understand the importance of prevention and of resilience. We want to support our private sector partners, whether they simply want to establish early lines of communication or call while under the strain of a continuing network breach.\n\nThe conversations we have at these events are essential to keep our nation secure, to protect the privacy of our citizens, to enable American businesses to compete fairly in our global economy and to ensure that U.S. businesses and institutions are resilient in the face of cyber threats. While we gather here in Iowa to work together to make this country safer, our adversaries likewise gather to strategize against us. The threats are not letting up and neither will we.\n\n\n\nThanks again for inviting me. I look forward to your questions.",

The defendants in some instances acted for their own personal financial gain, and in others for the benefit of the MSS or other Chinese government agencies. The hackers stole terabytes of data which comprised a sophisticated and prolific threat to U.S. networks.\n\nThe 11-count indictment alleges LI Xiaoyu (\u674e\u5578\u5b87), 34, and DONG Jiazhi (\u8463\u5bb6\u5fd7), 33, who were trained in computer applications technologies at the same Chinese university, conducted a hacking campaign lasting more than ten years to the present, targeting companies in countries with high technology industries, including the United States, Australia, Belgium, Germany, Japan, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Spain, South Korea, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Targeted industries included, among others, high tech manufacturing; medical device, civil, and industrial engineering; business, educational, and gaming software; solar energy; pharmaceuticals; defense. In at least one instance, the hackers sought to extort cryptocurrency from a victim entity, by threatening to release the victim\u2019s stolen source code on the Internet. More recently, the defendants probed for vulnerabilities in computer networks of companies developing COVID-19 vaccines, testing technology, and treatments.\n\nThe charges were announced by Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers; FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich; U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Washington William D. Hyslop; and Special Agent in Charge of the FBI\u2019s Seattle Field Division Raymond Duda.\n\n\u201cChina has now taken its place, alongside Russia, Iran and North Korea, in that shameful club of nations that provide a safe haven for cyber criminals in exchange for those criminals being \u2018on call\u2019 to work for the benefit of the state, here to feed the Chinese Communist party\u2019s insatiable hunger for American and other non-Chinese companies\u2019 hard-earned intellectual property,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s indictment demonstrates the serious consequences the Chinese Communist Party will face if it continues to deploy malicious cyber tactics to either steal what they cannot create or silence what they do not want to hear,\u201d said FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich. \u201cCybercrimes directed by the Chinese government\u2019s intelligence services not only threaten the United States but also every other country that supports fair play, international norms, and the rule of law, and it also seriously undermines China's desire to become a respected leader in world affairs. The FBI and our international partners will not stand idly by to this threat, and we are committed to holding the Chinese Communist Party accountable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe cybercrime hacking occurring here was first discovered on computers of the Department of Energy\u2019s Hanford Site in Eastern Washington. As the grand jury charged, the computer systems of many businesses, individuals and agencies throughout the United States and worldwide have been hacked and compromised with a huge array of sensitive and valuable trade secrets, technologies, data, and personal information being stolen. The hackers operated from China both for their own gain and with the assistance and for the benefit of the Chinese government\u2019s Ministry of State Security. This prosecution is occurring as a result of the combined unwavering efforts of the National Security Division of the Department of Justice, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Washington, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. We seek justice for these victims and others affected and we intend to prosecute these defendants for their alleged crimes,\u201d said U.S. Attorney William D. Hyslop for the District Eastern District of Washington.\n\n\"The complicated nature of cyber investigations is only exacerbated when the criminal is backed by the resources of a foreign government. The nature and value of the material stolen by these hackers cannot just be measured in dollars and was indicative of being state driven. This case demonstrates the FBI's dedication to pursuing these criminals no matter who is sanctioning their activities,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Raymond Duda of the FBI\u2019s Seattle Division.\n\nAccording to the indictment, to gain initial access to victim networks, the defendants primarily exploited publicly known software vulnerabilities in popular web server software, web application development suites, and software collaboration programs. In some cases, those vulnerabilities were newly announced, meaning that many users would not have installed patches to correct the vulnerability. The defendants also targeted insecure default configurations in common applications. The defendants used their initial unauthorized access to place malicious web shell programs (e.g., the \u201cChina Chopper\u201d web shell) and credential-stealing software on victim networks, which allowed them to remotely execute commands on victim computers.\n\nTo conceal the theft of information from victim networks and otherwise evade detection, the defendants typically packaged victim data in encrypted Roshal Archive Compressed files (RAR files), changed RAR file and victim documents\u2019 names and extensions (e.g., from \u201c.rar\u201d to \u201c.jpg\u201d) and system timestamps, and concealed programs and documents at innocuous-seeming locations on victim networks and in victim networks\u2019 \u201crecycle bins.\u201d The defendants frequently returned to re-victimize companies, government entities, and organizations from which they had previously stolen data, in some cases years after the initial successful data theft. In several instances, however, the defendants were unsuccessful in this regard, due to the efforts of the FBI and network defenders.\n\nThe indictment charges the defendants with conspiring to steal trade secrets from at least eight known victims, which consisted of technology designs, manufacturing processes, test mechanisms and results, source code, and pharmaceutical chemical structures. Such information would give competitors with a market edge by providing insight into proprietary business plans and savings on research and development costs in creating competing products.\n\nThe defendants are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets, which carries a maximum sentence of ten years in prison; one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; one count of unauthorized access of a computer, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; and seven counts of aggravated identity theft, which each carries a mandatory sentence of two non-consecutive years in prison. The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencings of the defendants will be determined by the assigned judge.\n\nThe investigation was conducted jointly by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Washington, the National Security Division of the Department of Justice, and the FBI\u2019s Spokane Resident Agency and San Antonio Field Office. The FBI\u2019s Cyber Division assisted in the investigation and, along with FBI\u2019s Cyber Assistant Legal Attach\u00e9s and Legal Attach\u00e9s in countries around the world, provided essential support. Numerous victims cooperated and provided valuable assistance in the investigation.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney James Goeke of the Eastern District of Washington and Trial Attorney Scott McCulloch of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting this case.\n\nThe details contained in the charging document are allegations. The defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.\n\nThe year 2020 marks the 150th anniversary of the Department of Justice.

            "article_text": "Mozaffar Khazaee, 61, formerly of Manchester, Connecticut, was sentenced today to 97 months in prison and ordered to pay a $50,000 fine by U.S. District Judge Vanessa L. Bryant of the District of Connecticut for violating the Arms Export Control Act by attempting to send to Iran highly sensitive, proprietary, trade secret and export controlled material relating to U.S. military jet engines, which he had stolen from multiple U.S. defense contractors where he had previously been employed.\n\nAssistant Attorney General for National Security John P. Carlin, U.S. Attorney Deirdre M. Daly of the District of Connecticut, Special Agent in Charge Matthew Etre of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement-Homeland Security Investigations (ICE-HSI) Boston, Assistant Director Randall C. Coleman of the FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Division, Special Agent in Charge Craig W. Rupert of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) Northeast Field Office, Special Agent in Charge Danielle Angley of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations and Special Agent in Charge John McKenna of the Department of Commerce's Office of Export Enforcement Boston Office made the announcement.\n\n\u201cMozaffar Khazaee exploited his privileged access to national security assets to steal highly sensitive military technology with the intent of providing it to Iran,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Carlin.\u00a0 \u201cViolations of the Arms Export Control Act, particularly those involving attempts to transfer sensitive defense technology to a foreign power, are among the most significant national security threats we face, and we will continue to leverage the criminal justice system to prevent, confront, and disrupt them.\u201d\n\n\u201cMozaffar Khazaee betrayed his defense contractor employers and the national security interests of the United States by stealing and attempting to send to Iran voluminous documents containing highly sensitive U.S. defense technology,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Daly.\u00a0 \u201cU.S. companies are being relentlessly targeted by those who seek to steal our intellectual property, our trade secrets and our advanced defense technology \u2013 whether through a computer hack or cyber intrusion, or through an insider or rogue employee.\u00a0 As this case demonstrates, we will aggressively investigate and hold accountable those who attempt to steal trade secrets and military technology from U.S. industries, whether for their own personal gain or for the benefit of foreign actors.\u201d\n\n\u201cStopping people like Mozaffar Khazaee from providing U.S. military technology to foreign powers is crucial to our national security interests,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Etre.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s abundantly clear from court records that this individual intended to harm U.S. interests both here and abroad.\u00a0 HSI will continue to work with our federal law enforcement partners to ensure that advanced U.S. military technology is not stolen and illegally exported for the benefit of foreign entities.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Khazaee abused a position of trust and responsibility by stealing trade secrets and sensitive information belonging to defense contractors developing some of our most advanced aircraft,\u201d said Assistant Director Coleman.\u00a0 \u201cHis actions could have put our national security at risk.\u00a0 Stopping his plan and holding him accountable for his betrayal was a whole-of-government effort.\u00a0 We will use all available legal means to pursue individuals willing to help our adversaries by stealing our technical know-how.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe evidence developed during this investigation and today\u2019s sentencing of Mr. Khazaee illustrate the potential for harm to the U.S. through illegal exportation of sensitive documents and technology,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Rupert.\u00a0 \u201cDCIS, along with our partner agencies, continues to prioritize and pursue these investigations to curtail any adverse impact to America's warfighters and shield America's investment in national defense.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis case was enabled by the outstanding teamwork amongst the many federal law enforcement agencies and U.S. Attorney\u2019s office,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Angley.\u00a0 \u201cCritical was the ability to leverage subject matter experts from the Air Force\u2019s acquisition community who provided the technical assessments of the high value technology.\u00a0 While the conclusion of this case neutralized the threat of this particular person, it also highlights the need for continued and ever more vigilant protection of our critical technologies.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday's sentencing demonstrates the ongoing cooperation between the U.S. Department of Commerce and other federal law enforcement partners working together in unison to prevent sensitive U.S. origin technology from falling into the wrong hands,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge McKenna.\n\nAccording to court documents and statements made in court, at different times between 2001 and 2013, Khazaee, a dual citizen of Iran and the United States with a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering, was employed by three separate defense contractors.\u00a0 From at least 2009 through late 2013, Khazaee offered to provide trade secret, proprietary and export controlled defense technology that he had stolen from his U.S. employers to gain employment with state-controlled technical universities in Iran.\n\nBeginning in late 2009, Khazaee corresponded by email with an individual in Iran to whom he attempted to send and in some cases did send documents containing trade secret, proprietary and export controlled material relating to the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Program.\u00a0 In one email Khazaee stated that the material he had attached was \u201cvery controlled . . . and I am taking [a] big risk.\u201d \u00a0Khazaee instructed the individual in Iran, \u201cafter downloading,\u201d he should \u201cdelete everything immediately.\u201d\n\nAnalysis of Khazaee\u2019s computer media also revealed cover letters and application documents, dating from 2009 through late 2013, which Khazaee sent to multiple state-controlled technical universities in Iran.\u00a0 In those materials, Khazaee stated that as \u201clead engineer\u201d in various projects with U.S. defense contractors, he had learned \u201ckey technique[s] that could be transferred to our own industry and universities.\u201d\u00a0 Khazaee stated that he wanted to \u201cmove to Iran,\u201d that he was \u201clooking for an opportunity to work in Iran,\u201d and that he was interested in \u201ctransferring my skill and knowledge to my nation.\u201d\n\nIn or about November 2013, while residing in Connecticut, Khazaee attempted to send a large shipping container to Iran.\u00a0 The shipment included, in numerous boxes and on computer media, thousands of highly sensitive technical manuals, specification sheets, test results, technical drawings and data and other proprietary material relating to U.S. military jet engines, including those relating to the U.S. Air Force\u2019s F35 JSF program and the F-22 Raptor.\u00a0 The materials in the interdicted shipment had been stolen from U.S. defense contractors where Khazaee had worked and many documents were prominently labeled with strict export control warnings. \u00a0Khazaee did not apply for nor did he obtain any license to export any of the documents and the export or attempted export of such material to Iran is illegal.\n\nOn Jan. 9, 2014, Khazaee was arrested at the Newark Liberty International Airport before boarding a flight to Iran.\u00a0 Search warrants executed on Khazaee\u2019s checked and carry-on luggage revealed additional hard copy documents and computer media containing sensitive, proprietary, trade secret and export controlled documents relating to U.S. military jet engines.\u00a0 Khazaee was also found in the possession of $59,945.00 in as-yet undeclared cash, which he had split up into increments of approximately $5,000 and secreted in multiple bank envelopes in various places in his carry-on luggage.\n\nThe hard copy and electronic material that Khazaee stole and sought to transfer to Iran totaled some 50,000 pages and was reviewed by experts from both the U.S. Air Force and the victim defense contractors.\u00a0 In addition to the materials relating to the JSF Program and the F-22 Raptor, Khazaee also had documents from numerous other U.S. military engine programs, including the V-22 Osprey, the C130J Hercules and the Global Hawk engine programs.\u00a0 In total, Khazaee sought to export approximately 1,500 documents containing trade secrets and approximately 600 documents containing highly sensitive defense technology.\n\nAccording to analyses by the U.S. Air Force and victim defense contractors, the technical data that Khazaee stole would have helped Iran \u201cleap forward\u201d ten years or more in academic and military turbine engine research and development, reducing their investment in such technology by one to two billion dollars and potentially enhancing the development and effectiveness of their weapon systems.\n\nKhazaee has been detained since his arrest on Jan. 9, 2014.\u00a0 On Feb. 25, 2015, he pleaded guilty to one count of unlawful export and attempted export of defense articles from the U.S. in violation of the Arms Export Control Act.\n\nThis case was investigated by the ICE-HSI\u2019 New England Division, the FBI\u2019s New Haven Division, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service in New Haven, the U.S. Air Force\u2019s Office of Special Investigations in Boston and the Department of Commerce\u2019s Office of Export Enforcement in Boston.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Carlin and U.S. Attorney Daly also commended the efforts of the many other agencies and offices that were involved in this investigation, including the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices of the Central District of California, the Southern District of Indiana and the District of New Jersey; ICE-HSI in Los Angeles; the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Service (CBP) in Los Angeles; the U.S. Air Force\u2019s Office of Special Investigations in Los Angeles; as well as ICE-HSI, CBP and FBI in New Jersey; and HSI, FBI and DCIS in Indianapolis.\n\nThis case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Reynolds of the District of Connecticut and Trial Attorney Brian Fleming of the Justice Department\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.",

            "article_text": "Greenbelt, Maryland - A federal jury has convicted Nader Modanlo, a/k/a Nader Modanlou, a/k/a Nader Modanlu, age 52, of Potomac, Maryland, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Iran, of charges arising from a conspiracy to illegally provide satellite related services to Iran in violation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, money laundering and obstruction of bankruptcy proceedings. As a result of the conspiracy, an Iranian earth observation satellite equipped with a camera was launched into space from Russia on October 27, 2005. The launch was the first-ever Iranian satellite put into orbit.\n\nThe jury verdict was announced by United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein; Special Agent in Charge William Winter of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI); Special Agent in Charge Thomas J. Kelly of the Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigation, Washington, D.C. Field Office; and Special Agent in Charge Robert Craig of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, Mid-Atlantic Field Office.\n\n\u201cNader Modanlo violated the law by helping Iran launch communications satellites,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Rod J. Rosenstein. \u201cThe Iran Trade Embargo prohibits Americans from supplying goods, technology and services to Iran directly or indirectly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis conviction is the result of a complex, decade long HSI investigation that spanned multiple countries and involved close partnership with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Maryland, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service and the Internal Revenue Service,\u201d said HSI Special Agent in Charge in Baltimore William Winter. \u201cThis investigation shows that HSI special agents will tenaciously pursue those who attempt to illegally export sensitive technologies and threaten the security of the United States by willfully violating our customs laws.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS), the criminal investigative arm of the Office of the Inspector General, Department of Defense, is committed to pursuing cases involving the illegal transfer of critical U.S. Defense Department-related technologies throughout the world,\u201d said Robert E. Craig, Jr., Special Agent in Charge of the DCIS Mid-Atlantic Field Office. \u201cAlong with our law enforcement partners and as demonstrated in this case, DCIS is diligently pursuing individuals and companies that willingly break the law and unnecessarily place the safety of America's warfighters and all Americans at risk.\u201d\n\n\u201cIRS Criminal Investigation is committed to following the money trail across the globe and will not be deterred by the use of front companies and sophisticated financial transactions that hide the real ownership of the proceeds of criminal activity,\u201d said Thomas J. Kelly, Special Agent in Charge, IRS Criminal Investigation, Washington DC Field Office. \u201cToday\u2019s verdict is a reminder that IRS Criminal Investigation along with our domestic and international law enforcement partners will continue our vigilant pursuit of criminal conspiracies.\u201d\n\nThe President of the United States issued an Executive Order in 1995 imposing a trade embargo against Iran, after finding that Iran\u2019s policies and actions posed a threat to the national security of the United States. Under the embargo, the Department of the Treasury, through the Office of Foreign Assets Control, issued the Iranian Transactions Regulations, which prohibited the export, re-export, sale or supply, directly or indirectly, by a U.S. citizen, of goods, technology or services to Iran or the Government of Iran, without prior governmental authorization.\n\nAccording to evidence presented at the six week trial, Modanlo was a mechanical engineer who received science and engineering degrees from George Washington University. Modanlo represented that he was an internationally-recognized expert on strategic policy and finances affecting the space-based telecommunications industry, and that he managed space and science programs for the Department of Defense, NASA and the industry.\n\nTrial evidence showed that from January 2000 through November 27, 2007, Modanlo and others concocted a scheme to evade the Iran trade embargo to conceal Iranian involvement in prohibited activities and transactions. Beginning in 1992, Modanlo was the principal owner, chairman and president of Final Analysis, Inc. (FAI) in Maryland. Beginning in 1994, FAI contracted with POLYOT, an aerospace enterprise company owned by the government of the Russian Federation, to launch FAI telecommunications satellites. Between 1995 through 2000, FAI and POLYOT launched a satellite purchased by FAI, and designed, constructed and launched a second satellite, both from Plesetsk, Russia. Modanlo and other FAI personnel met with POLYOT officials as part of that relationship. As required by law, Modanlo obtained U.S. export licenses in order to export and launch the telecommunications satellites and other equipment from Russia.\n\nIn November 2001, Modanlo established New York Satellite Industries, LLC, (NYSI) after creditors filed a petition to place FAI into involuntary bankruptcy. NYSI purchased FAI\u2019s assets and Modanlo served as chairman and managing member of NYSI, using his home address as NYSI\u2019s business address.\n\nBeginning in 2000, Modanlo brokered an agreement between POLYOT and Iran to construct and launch a satellite. Between the summer of 2001 and December 2001, Modanlo engaged in numerous meetings with POLYOT officials to broker Iran\u2019s satellite program. In December 2001, several Iranian officials, including Sirous Naseri, a former Iranian Amabassador to Switzerland, went to Switzerland to express interest in \u201cinvesting\u201d in NYSI by interposing a Swiss company, because \u201cthe U.S. ha[d] sanctions in place against Iran,\u201d and direct investment would therefore be \u201cproblematic.\u201d Naseri, Reza Heidari, Mohammad Modares and Modanlo then went to Switzerland in April 2002 to work out the details of forming Prospect Telecom in order to conceal Iranian participation as an investor/lender in Modanlo\u2019s satellite telecommunications activities. Between April and June 2002, Heidari, Mohammad Modares and Abdol Mehrdad established Prospect Telecom and opened a bank account in Switzerland in the name of Prospect Telecom.\n\nHeidari, Modares, and Mehrdad then caused $10 million to be wired from Prospect Telecom\u2019s bank account overseas to Modanlo\u2019s NYSI account in Bowie, Maryland, in consideration for Modanlo\u2019s assistance to Iran and the Iranians in brokering the satellite agreement with Russia, and for NYSI providing telecommunications services in support of that agreement. Modanlo had agreed that NYSI would assist in obtaining telecommunications service provider licenses for the owners of Prospect Telecom and for the benefit of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\nIn October 2005, as a result of the efforts of Modanlo and his conspirators, POLYOT launched Iran\u2019s first-ever satellite, a remote sensing and telecommunications satellite from Russia.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2007, Modanlo made false statements and concealed information about the creation and ownership of Prospect Telecom during bankruptcy proceedings, including that Modanlo and co-conspirators had arranged for the formation of Prospect telecom to conceal Iranian involvement.\n\nModanlo faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison for the conspiracy; 10 years in prison on each of two counts of violating the Iran Trade Embargo, 20 years on money laundering related to the transfer of the $10 million from Switzerland to the defendant\u2019s NYSI bank account, 10 years for each of five subsequent money-laundering transactions, which disbursed most of the $10 million; and 20 years in prison for obstruction of a bankruptcy proceeding. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on one count of violating the Iran Trade Embargo. U.S. District Judge Peter J. Messitte scheduled sentencing for September 11, 2013. The government also seeks the forfeiture of $10 million, which is the proceeds of the offense.\n\nThe other defendants charged in the indictment, Hamid Malmirian, age 53; Reza Heidari, age 52; Mohammad Modares, age 44; Abdol Reza Mehrdad, age 43; and Sirous Naseri, age 55, all Iranian nationals, remain at large.\n\nUnited States Attorney Rod J. Rosenstein praised the HSI Baltimore, DCIS and IRS - Criminal Investigation for their work in the investigation. Mr. Rosenstein thanked Assistant United States Attorneys David I. Salem and Stuart Berman, who are prosecuting the case.",

Craig, Jr., Special Agent in Charge of the DCIS Mid-Atlantic Field Office.  \u201cDCIS, the criminal investigative arm of the Office of Inspector General, Department of Defense (DoD), is committed to pursuing cases involving the illegal transfer of U.S. Defense Department-related technologies around the world and ensuring the safety of America\u2019s warfighters and all Americans.\u201d\n\nThe President of the United States issued an Executive Order in 1995 imposing a trade embargo against Iran, after finding that Iran's policies and actions posed a threat to the national security of the United States.  Under the embargo, the Department of the Treasury, through the Office of Foreign Assets Control, issued the Iranian Transactions Regulations, which prohibited the export, re-export, sale or supply, directly or indirectly, by a U.S. citizen, of goods, technology or services to Iran or the Government of Iran, without prior governmental authorization.\n\nAccording to evidence presented at the six week trial, Modanlo was a mechanical engineer who received science and engineering degrees from George Washington University. Modanlo represented that he was an internationally-recognized expert on strategic policy and finances affecting the space-based telecommunications industry, and that he managed space and science programs for the Department of Defense, NASA and the industry.\n\nTrial evidence showed that from January 2000 through November 27, 2007, Modanlo and others concocted an elaborate scheme to evade the Iran trade embargo to conceal Iranian involvement in prohibited activities and transactions. Beginning in 1992, Modanlo was the principal owner, chairman and president of Final Analysis, Inc. (FAI) in Maryland. Beginning in 1994, FAI contracted with POLYOT, an aerospace enterprise company owned by the government of the Russian Federation, to launch FAI telecommunications satellites. Between 1995 through 2000, FAI and POLYOT launched a satellite purchased by FAI, and designed, constructed and launched a second satellite, both from Plesetsk, Russia.  Modanlo and other FAI personnel met with POLYOT officials as part of that relationship. As required by law, Modanlo obtained U.S. export licenses in order to export and launch the telecommunications satellites and other equipment from Russia.\n\nIn November 2001, Modanlo established New York Satellite Industries, LLC, (NYSI) after creditors filed a petition to place FAI into involuntary bankruptcy. NYSI purchased FAI's assets and Modanlo served as chairman and managing member of NYSI, using his home address as NYSI's business address.\n\nBeginning in 2000, Modanlo brokered an agreement between POLYOT and Iran to construct and launch a satellite.   Between the summer of 2001 and December 2001, Modanlo engaged in numerous meetings with POLYOT officials to broker Iran=s satellite program.  In December 2001, several Iranian officials, including Sirous Naseri, a former Iranian Amabassador to Switzerland, went to Switzerland to express interest in \"investing\" in NYSI by interposing a Swiss company, because \"the U.S. ha[d] sanctions in place against Iran,\" and direct investment would therefore be \"problematic.\" Naseri, Reza Heidari, Mohammad Modares and Modanlo then went to Switzerland in April 2002 to work out the details of forming Prospect Telecom in order to conceal Iranian participation as an investor/lender in Modanlo's satellite telecommunications activities.  Between April and June 2002, Heidari, Mohammad Modares and Abdol Mehrdad established Prospect Telecom and opened a bank account in Switzerland in the name of Prospect Telecom.\n\nHeidari, Modares, and Mehrdad then caused $10 million to be wired into the Prospect Telecom bank account from numerous foreign accounts, including from China and Dubai, and then almost immediately wired the $10 million to Modanlo's NYSI account in Bowie, Maryland, in consideration for Modanlo\u2019s assistance to Iran and the Iranians in brokering the satellite agreement with Russia, and for NYSI providing telecommunications services in support of that agreement. Modanlo also had agreed that NYSI would assist in obtaining telecommunications service provider licenses for the owners of Prospect Telecom and for the benefit of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\nIn October 2005, as a result of the efforts of Modanlo and his conspirators, POLYOT launched Iran=s first-ever satellite, a remote sensing and telecommunications satellite from Russia.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2007, Modanlo made false statements and concealed information about the creation and ownership of Prospect Telecom during bankruptcy proceedings, including that Modanlo and co-conspirators had arranged for the formation of Prospect telecom to conceal Iranian involvement.\n\nUnited States Attorney Rod J. Rosenstein praised the HSI Baltimore, DCIS and IRS - Criminal Investigation for their work in the investigation.  Mr. Rosenstein thanked Assistant United States Attorneys David I. Salem and Stuart Berman, who prosecuted the case.\n\n",

            "article_text": "NEWARK, N.J. \u2013 An indictment returned by a federal grand jury was unsealed today in Newark, charging Faramarz Shahi Savandi, 34, and Mohammad Mehdi Shah Mansouri, 27, both of Iran, in a 34-month-long international computer hacking and extortion scheme involving the deployment of sophisticated ransomware, U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito for the District of New Jersey, Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, and Executive Assistant Director Amy S. Hess of the FBI announced.\n\nThe six-count indictment alleges that Savandi and Mansouri, acting from inside Iran, authored malware, known as \u201cSamSam Ransomware,\u201d capable of forcibly encrypting data on the computers of victims. According to the indictment, beginning in December 2015, Savandi and Mansouri would then allegedly access the computers of victim entities without authorization through security vulnerabilities, and install and execute the SamSam Ransomware on the computers, resulting in the encryption of data on the victims\u2019 computers. These more than 200 victims included hospitals, municipalities, and public institutions, according to the indictment, including the City of Atlanta, Georgia; the City of Newark, New Jersey; the Port of San Diego, California; the Colorado Department of Transportation; the University of Calgary in Calgary, Alberta, Canada; and six health care-related entities: Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles, California; Kansas Heart Hospital in Wichita, Kansas; Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, more commonly known as LabCorp, headquartered in Burlington, North Carolina; MedStar Health, headquartered in Columbia, Maryland; Nebraska Orthopedic Hospital now known as OrthoNebraska Hospital, in Omaha, Nebraska and Allscripts Healthcare Solutions Inc., headquartered in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Savandi and Mansouri would then extort victim entities by demanding a ransom paid in the virtual currency Bitcoin in exchange for decryption keys for the encrypted data, collecting ransom payments from victim entities that paid the ransom, and exchanging the Bitcoin proceeds into Iranian rial using Iran-based Bitcoin exchangers. The indictment alleges that, as a result of their conduct, Savandi and Mansouri have collected over $6 million USD in ransom payments to date, and caused over $30 million USD in losses to victims.\n\n\u201cThe defendants in this case developed and deployed the SamSam Ransomware in order to hold public and private entities hostage and then extort money from them,\u201d U.S. Attorney Carpenito said. \u201cAs the indictment in this case details, they started with a business in Mercer County and then moved on to major public entities, like the City of Newark, and healthcare providers, like the Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles and the Kansas Heart Hospital in Wichita \u2013 cravenly taking advantage of the fact that these victims depend on their computer networks to serve the public, the sick, and the injured without interruption. The charges announced today show that the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of New Jersey will continue to act to disrupt such criminal acts, and identify those who are responsible for them, no matter where in the world they may seek to hide.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Iranian defendants allegedly used hacking and malware to cause more than $30 million in losses to more than 200 victims,\u201d Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein said. \u201cAccording to the indictment, the hackers infiltrated computer systems in 10 states and Canada and then demanded payment. The criminal activity harmed state agencies, city governments, hospitals, and countless innocent victims.\u201d\u201cThe allegations in the indictment unsealed today\u2014the first of its kind\u2014outline an Iran-based international computer hacking and extortion scheme that engaged in 21st-century digital blackmail,\u201d Assistant Attorney General Benczkowski said. \u201cThese defendants allegedly used ransomware to infect the computer networks of municipalities, hospitals, and other key public institutions, locking out the computer owners, and then demanded millions of dollars in payments from them. As today\u2019s charges demonstrate, the Criminal Division and its law enforcement partners will relentlessly pursue cybercriminals who harm American citizens, businesses, and institutions, regardless of where those criminals may reside.\u201d\u201cThis indictment demonstrates the FBI\u2019s continuous commitment to unmasking malicious actors behind the world\u2019s most egregious cyberattacks,\u201d said Executive Assistant Director Hess. \u201cBy calling out those who threaten American systems, we expose criminals who hide behind their computer and launch attacks that threaten our public safety and national security. The actions highlighted today, which represent a continuing trend of cyber criminal activity emanating from Iran, were particularly threatening, as they targeted public safety institutions, including U.S. hospital systems and governmental entities. The FBI, with the assistance of our private sector and U.S. government partners, are sending a strong message that we will work together to investigate and hold all criminals accountable.\u201d\n\nSavandi and Mansouri are charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit fraud and related activity in connection with computers, two substantive counts of intentional damage to a protected computer and two substantive counts of transmitting a demand in relation to damaging a protected computer.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Savandi and Mansouri created the first version of the SamSam Ransomware in December 2015, and created further refined versions in June and October 2017. In addition to employing Iran-based Bitcoin exchangers, the indictment alleges that the defendants also utilized overseas computer infrastructure to commit their attacks. Savandi and Mansouri would also use sophisticated online reconnaissance techniques (such as scanning for computer network vulnerabilities) and conduct online research in order to select and target potential victims, according to the indictment. According to the indictment, the defendants would also disguise their attacks to appear like legitimate network activity.\n\nTo carry out their scheme, the indictment alleges that the defendants also employed the use of Tor, a computer network designed to facilitate anonymous communication over the internet. According to the indictment, the defendants maximized the damage caused to victims by launching attacks outside regular business hours, when a victim would find it more difficult to mitigate the attack, and by encrypting backups of the victims\u2019 computers. This was intended to\u2014and often did\u2014cripple the regular business operations of the victims, according to the indictment. The most recent ransomware attack against a victim alleged in the indictment took place on Sept. 25, 2018.\n\nThis case was investigated by the FBI\u2019s Newark Field Office. Assistant U.S. Attorney and Chief of the Cybercrimes Unit Justin S. Herring of the District of New Jersey and Senior Counsel William A. Hall Jr. of the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) are prosecuting the case. The Department thanks its law enforcement colleagues at the National Crime Agency (UK), West Yorkshire Police (UK), Calgary Police Service (Canada), and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Significant assistance was provided by the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division and the Criminal Division\u2019s Office of International Affairs.\n\nVictims are encouraged to contact their local FBI field office and file a complaint online with the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). The IC3 staff reviews complaints, looking for patterns or other indicators of significant criminal activity, and refers investigative packages of complaints to the appropriate law enforcement authorities in a particular city or region. The FBI provides a variety of resources relating to ransomware through the IC3, which can be reached atwww.ic3.gov.

Forrester, an Attorney-Adviser in the Office of Legal Counsel.\u00a0 In his role as editor of published Office of Legal Counsel opinions, he is clearing away the publication backlog.\u00a0 In addition, his self-initiated work in compiling, analyzing, and producing a volume of OLC opinions from 1934-1977 is making an important historic contribution.\u00a0\u00a0 Forrester deftly and fairly supervises the other Attorney-Advisers in the Office who look to his example and wisdom for guidance in their own work.\u00a0 Despite a massive workload, his work is always of the highest quality and his love of the Constitution\u00a0 and its history makes him a model of government lawyering.\n\nThe John Marshall Award for Asset Forfeiture is presented to Daniel H. Claman, Assistant Deputy Chief for the Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section of the Criminal Division.\u00a0 Claman is nominated for his exemplary work in implementing the Department\u2019s Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative and using civil forfeiture actions to recover the proceeds of foreign official corruption.\u00a0 He is a leader in the forfeiture of foreign corruption, and in the return of those ill-gotten gains to the victims of these crimes.\n\nThe John Marshall Award for Alternative Dispute Resolution recipient is L. Misha Preheim, Senior Trial Counsel in the Commercial Litigation Branch of the Civil Division, for his work in resolving the disputes of military personnel who were challenging the Department of Defense\u2019s decision to award only one-half separation pay upon their discharge from the military pursuant to the \u201cDon\u2019t Ask Don\u2019t Tell\u201d policy.\u00a0 Preheim spearheaded the drive to resolve this case and brokered a framework that provided for payment to a large number of former service members who, without Preheim\u2019s efforts, were likely to wait a substantial period of time for relief through the courts or military review boards.\n\nThe John Marshall Interagency Cooperation in Support of Litigation Award goes to Luke B. Marsh, Chief Trial Attorney for the Division of Enforcement at the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, for his work in addressing schemes to manipulate LIBOR interest rates.\u00a0 Marsh is nominated for his exceptional assistance to the department in the high-profile investigations and prosecutions of individuals, multi-national banks and other financial institutions engaged in wide-ranging and complex schemes to manipulate LIBOR and other benchmark interest rates affecting trillions of dollars of loans, mortgages and complex financial products worldwide.\u00a0 He has been one of the lead prosecutors on this matter from the inception of the investigations, and was responsible for investigating more than 20 banks and hundreds of individuals involved in the scheme.\n\nAlso awarded the John Marshall Interagency Cooperation in Support of Litigation Award is a team of attorneys from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Puerto Rico for their exemplary partnership in supporting the district\u2019s violent crime reduction initiative.\u00a0 This team is responsible for prosecuting more than 500 individuals as part of an effort to target violent criminals and halt the surging murder rate in Puerto Rico.\u00a0 From November 2011 until December 2012, the team achieved an almost perfect conviction rate, and the targeted areas of San Juan, Bayamon, Caguas, Carolina and Ponce have seen a combined decrease in the number of homicides of 25 percent, amounting to 150 fewer murders when compared to the murder rate in 2011.\u00a0 From the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Puerto Rico, recipients include: Victor O. Acevedo, Max Perez-Bouret, Amanda C. Soto, Maria L. Montanez and Kelly Zen\u00f3n, Special Assistant U.S. Attorneys.",

            "article_text": "Rod J. Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General of the United States, Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, William F. Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d), and John C. Demers, Assistant Attorney General for National Security, announced today the unsealing of an indictment charging GHOLAMREZA RAFATNEJAD, EHSAN MOHAMMADI, ABDOLLAH KARIMA, a/k/a \u201cVahid Karima,\u201d MOSTAFA SADEGHI, SEYED ALI MIRKARIMI, MOHAMMED REZA SABAHI, ROOZBEH SABAHI, ABUZAR GOHARI MOQADAM, and SAJJAD TAHMASEBI.\u00a0 The defendants were each leaders, contractors, associates, hackers-for-hire, and affiliates of the Mabna Institute, an Iran-based company that was responsible for a coordinated campaign of cyber intrusions that began in at least 2013 into computer systems belonging to 144 U.S.-based universities, 176 universities across 21 foreign countries, 47 domestic and foreign private sector companies, the United States Department of Labor, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the State of Hawaii, the State of Indiana, the United Nations, and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund.\u00a0 Through the activities of the defendants, the Mabna Institute conducted these intrusions to steal over 30 terabytes of academic data and intellectual property from universities, and email inboxes from employees of victim private sector companies, government victims, and non-governmental organizations.\u00a0 The defendants conducted many of these intrusions on behalf of the Islamic Republic of Iran\u2019s (\u201cIran\u201d) Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (\u201cIRGC\u201d), one of several entities within the government of Iran responsible for gathering intelligence, as well as other Iranian government clients.\u00a0 In addition to these criminal charges, today the Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated the Mabna Institute and the nine defendants for sanctions for the malicious cyber-enabled activity outlined in the Indictment.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein said:\u00a0 \u201cThese nine Iranian nationals allegedly stole more than 31 terabytes of documents and data from more than 140 American universities, 30 American companies, five American government agencies, and also more than 176 universities in 21 foreign countries.\u00a0 For many of these intrusions, the defendants acted at the behest of the Iranian government and, specifically, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.\u00a0 The Department of Justice will aggressively investigate and prosecute hostile actors who attempt to profit from America\u2019s ideas by infiltrating our computer systems and stealing intellectual property.\u00a0 This case is important because it will disrupt the defendants\u2019 hacking operations and deter similar crimes.\u201d\n\nManhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said:\u00a0 \u201cToday, in one of the largest state-sponsored hacking campaigns ever prosecuted by the Department of Justice, we have unmasked criminals who normally hide behind the ones and zeros of computer code.\u00a0 As alleged, this massive and brazen cyber-assault on the computer systems of hundreds of universities in 22 countries, including the United States, and dozens of private sector companies and governmental organizations was conducted on behalf of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard.\u00a0 The hackers targeted innovations and intellectual property from our country\u2019s greatest minds.\u00a0 These defendants are now fugitives from American justice, no longer free to travel outside Iran without risk of arrest.\u00a0 The only way they will see the outside world is through their computer screens, but stripped of their greatest asset \u2013 anonymity.\u201d\n\nFBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said:\u00a0 \u201cThe numbers alone in this case are staggering, over 300 universities and 47 private sector companies both here in the United States and abroad were targeted to gain unauthorized access to online accounts and steal data.\u00a0 An estimated 30 terabytes was removed from universities\u2019 accounts since this attack began, which is roughly equivalent of 8 billion double-sided pages of text. \u00a0It is hard to quantify the value on the research and information that was taken from victims but it is estimated to be in the billions of dollars. The nine Iranians indicted today now find themselves wanted by the FBI and our partner law enforcement agencies around the globe \u2013 and like other cyber criminals they will soon learn their ability to freely move was just limited to the virtual world only.\u201d\n\nAccording to the allegations contained in the Indictment[1]unsealed today in Manhattan federal court:\n\nBackground on the Mabna Institute\n\nGHOLAMREZA RAFATNEJAD and EHSAN MOHAMMADI, the defendants, founded the Mabna Institute in approximately 2013 to assist Iranian universities and scientific and research organizations in stealing access to non-Iranian scientific resources.\u00a0 In furtherance of its mission, the Mabna Institute employed, contracted, and affiliated itself with hackers-for-hire and other contract personnel to conduct cyber intrusions to steal academic data, intellectual property, email inboxes and other proprietary data, including ABDOLLAH KARIMA, a/k/a \u201cVahid Karima,\u201d MOSTAFA SADEGHI, SEYED ALI MIRKARIMI, MOHAMMED REZA SABAHI, ROOZBEH SABAHI, ABUZAR GOHARI MOQADAM, and SAJJAD TAHMASEBI.\u00a0 The Mabna Institute contracted with both Iranian governmental and private entities to conduct hacking activities on their behalf, and specifically conducted the university spearphishing campaign on behalf of the IRGC.\u00a0 The Mabna Institute is located at Tehran, Sheikh Bahaii Shomali, Koucheh Dawazdeh Metri Sevom, Plak 14, Vahed 2, Code Posti 1995873351.\n\nUniversity Hacking Campaign\n\nThe Mabna Institute, through the activities of the defendants, targeted over 100,000 accounts of professors around the world.\u00a0 They successfully compromised approximately 8,000 professor email accounts across 144 U.S.-based universities, and 176 universities located in foreign countries, including Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.\u00a0 The campaign started in approximately 2013, and has continued through at least December 2017, and broadly targeted all types of academic data and intellectual property from the systems of compromised universities, including, among other things, academic journals, theses, dissertations, and electronic books.\u00a0 Through the course of the conspiracy, U.S.-based universities spent over approximately $3.4 billion to procure and access such data and intellectual property.\n\nThe hacking campaign against universities was conducted across multiple stages.\u00a0 First, the defendants conducted online reconnaissance of university professors, including to determine these professors\u2019 research interests and the academic articles they had published.\u00a0 Second, using the information collected during the reconnaissance phase, the defendants created and sent spearphishing emails to targeted professors, which were personalized and created so as to appear to be sent from a professor at another university.\u00a0 In general, those spearphishing emails indicated that the purported sender had read an article the victim professor had recently published, and expressed an interest in several other articles, with links to those additional articles included in the spearphishing email.\u00a0 If the targeted professor clicked on certain links in the email, the professor would be directed to a malicious Internet domain named to appear confusingly similar to the authentic domain of the recipient professor\u2019s university.\u00a0 The malicious domain contained a webpage designed to appear to be the login webpage for the victim professor\u2019s university.\u00a0 It was the defendants\u2019 intent that the victim professor would be led to believe that he or she had inadvertently been logged out of his or her university\u2019s computer system, prompting the victim professor for his or her login credentials.\u00a0 If a professor then entered his or her login credentials, those credentials were then logged and captured by the hackers.\n\nFinally, the members of the conspiracy used stolen account credentials to obtain unauthorized access to victim professor accounts, through which they then exfiltrated intellectual property, research, and other academic data and documents from the systems of compromised universities, including, among other things, academic journals, theses, dissertations, and electronic books.\u00a0 The defendants targeted data across all fields of research and academic disciplines, including science and technology, engineering, social sciences, medical, and other professional fields.\u00a0 At least approximately 31.5 terabytes of academic data and intellectual property from compromised universities were stolen and exfiltrated to servers under the control of members of the conspiracy located in countries outside the United States.\n\nIn addition to stealing academic data and login credentials for university professors for the benefit of the Government of Iran, the defendants also sold the stolen data through two websites, Megapaper.ir (\u201cMegapaper\u201d) and Gigapaper.ir (\u201cGigapaper\u201d).\u00a0 Megapaper was operated by Falinoos Company (\u201cFalinoos\u201d), a company controlled by ABDOLLAH KARIMA, a/k/a \u201cVahid Karima,\u201d the defendant, and Gigapaper was affiliated with KARIMA.\u00a0 Megapaper sold stolen academic resources to customers within Iran, including Iran-based public universities and institutions, and Gigapaper sold a service to customers within Iran whereby purchasing customers could use compromised university professor accounts to directly access the online library systems of particular United States-based and foreign universities.\n\nPrior to the unsealing of the Indictment, the FBI provided foreign law enforcement partners with detailed information regarding victims within their jurisdictions, so that victims in foreign countries could be notified and so that foreign partners could assist in remediation efforts.\n\nPrivate Sector Hacking Victims\n\nIn addition to targeting and compromising universities, the Mabna Institute defendants targeted and compromised employee email accounts for at least approximately 36 United States-based private companies, and at least approximately 11 private companies based in Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, and exfiltrated entire email mailboxes from compromised employees\u2019 accounts.\u00a0 Among the United States-based private sector victims were three academic publishers, two media and entertainment companies, one law firm, 11 technology companies, five consulting firms, four marketing firms, two banking and/or investment firms, two online car sales companies, one healthcare company, one employee benefits company, one industrial machinery company, one biotechnology company, one food and beverage company, and one stock images company.\n\nIn order to compromise accounts of private sector victims, members of the conspiracy used a technique known as \u201cpassword spraying,\u201d whereby they first collected lists of names and email accounts associated with the intended victim company through open source Internet searches.\u00a0 Then, they attempted to gain access to those accounts with commonly-used passwords, such as frequently used default passwords, in order to attempt to obtain unauthorized access to as many accounts as possible.\u00a0 Once they obtained access to the victim accounts, members of the conspiracy, among other things, exfiltrated entire email mailboxes from the victims.\u00a0 In addition, in many cases, the defendants established automated forwarding rules for compromised accounts that would prospectively forward new outgoing and incoming email messages from the compromised accounts to email accounts controlled by the conspiracy.\n\nU.S. Government and NGO Hacking Victims\n\nIn the same time period as the university and private sector hacking campaigns described above, the Mabna Institute also conducted a computer hacking campaign against various governmental and non-governmental organizations within the United States.\u00a0 During the course of that campaign, employee login credentials were stolen by members of the conspiracy through password spraying.\u00a0 Among the victims were the following, all based in the United States:\u00a0 the United States Department of Labor, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the State of Hawaii, the State of Indiana, the State of Indiana Department of Education, the United Nations, and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund.\u00a0 As with private sector victims, the defendants targeted for theft email inboxes of employees of these organizations.\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\n\nGHOLAMREZA RAFATNEJAD, EHSAN MOHAMMADI, ABDOLLAH KARIMA, a/k/a \u201cVahid Karima,\u201d MOSTAFA SADEGHI, SEYED ALI MIRKARIMI, MOHAMMED REZA SABAHI, ROOZBEH SABAHI, ABUZAR GOHARI MOQADAM, and SAJJAD TAHMASEBI, the defendants, are citizens and residents of Iran. \u00a0Each is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusions, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; two counts of unauthorized access of a computer, each of which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; two counts of wire fraud, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; and one count of aggravated identity theft, which carries a mandatory sentence of two years in prison.\u00a0 The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencings of the defendants will be determined by the assigned judge.\n\nMr. Berman praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI, the assistance of the United Kingdom\u2019s National Crime Agency (NCA), and the support of the OFAC.\u00a0 The case is being handled by the Office\u2019s Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit.\u00a0 Assistant United States Attorneys Timothy T. Howard, Jonathan Cohen, and Richard Cooper are in charge of the prosecution, with assistance provided by Heather Alpino and Jason McCullough of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.\n\nThe charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\n\n[1]As the introductory phrase signifies, the entirety of the text of the Indictment, and the description of the Indictment set forth herein, constitute only allegations, and every fact described should be treated as an allegation.",

            "article_text": "United States Attorney Matthew D. Krueger announced that he will resign from his position as the chief law enforcement officer for the Eastern District of Wisconsin on February 20, 2021.\u00a0 After his departure, Krueger plans to join a private law firm.\u00a0 Richard G. Frohling, who has served as the First Assistant U.S. Attorney during Krueger\u2019s tenure, will become the Acting U.S. Attorney.\n\n\"Serving as United States Attorney has been the greatest privilege of my professional life,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Krueger.\u00a0 \u201cIn the past three years, we faced unprecedented challenges, including the longest government shutdown in history, a global pandemic, and turbulent civil unrest.\u00a0 The dedicated professionals in the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, together with our selfless federal, tribal, state, and law enforcement partners, met each challenge with grit, integrity, and an unwavering commitment to justice.\u00a0 I could not be more grateful or proud to have worked alongside such talented and committed public servants.\u201d\n\nThe Eastern District of Wisconsin comprises 28 counties with a population of approximately 3.3 million people.\u00a0 The United States Attorney\u2019s Office (\u201cthe Office\u201d), with locations in Milwaukee and Green Bay, has over 80 employees, including attorneys and support staff.\u00a0 The Office and is responsible for conducting all criminal and civil litigation in the district involving the United States government.\n\n\u201cU.S. Attorney Krueger has been a true partner in our joint law enforcement mission of keeping the citizens of Wisconsin safe,\u201d said FBI Special Agent in Charge Robert Hughes.\u00a0 \u201cWe wish him the best of luck in all of his future endeavors.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnited States Attorney Krueger has always represented the citizens of the Eastern District of Wisconsin with poise and professionalism,\u201d complimented ATF Special Agent in Charge Kristen de Tineo of the Chicago Field Division. \u00a0\u201cHis dedication to ensuring the safety of the communities he served was always his first priority, and I wish him continued success in his future endeavors.\u201d\n\n\u201cMatt Krueger has honorably served as United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, tirelessly working to protect communities from the effects of drug trafficking and drug-related violence,\u201d said Robert J. Bell, Special Agent in Charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Chicago Division.\u00a0 \u201cHis office effectively prosecuted violent drug trafficking crimes, while ensuring equity in all matters and fairness to all people.\u00a0 Matt\u2019s steadfast leadership and partnership will be missed.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the United States Marshals Service, I would like to express our sincere gratitude to U.S. Attorney Matthew Krueger,\u201d said United States Marshal Anna Ruzinski. \u00a0\u201cMatt placed himself at the forefront of the fight against violent crime in the City of Milwaukee and throughout the Eastern District of Wisconsin.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs soon as Matt Krueger took office, he began tremendous efforts to build and nurture the relationships our Wisconsin law enforcement community now enjoys with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office,\u201d said Brian O\u2019Keefe, Administrator, Wisconsin Department of Justice, Division of Criminal Investigation.\u00a0 \u201cI can honestly say I have never seen a stronger partnership between law enforcement in our state and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices than we have seen in the last three years, in both the Eastern and Western Districts.\u201d\n\nUnder Krueger\u2019s leadership, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office brought numerous impactful prosecutions, recovered over $85 million dollars in criminal and civil cases, and defended the federal government\u2019s interests vigorously in litigation.\u00a0 The Office hired dozens of new staff, increased diversity within the Office, and added prosecutors in Green Bay to better serve the district\u2019s northern counties.\u00a0 In multiple areas, the Office had significant achievements:\n\nNational Security & Cyber Crime.Under U.S. Attorney Krueger\u2019s leadership, the Office pursued DOJ\u2019s top priority of national security.\u00a0 The Office obtained the first international terrorism convictions in the district\u2019s history (U.S. v. Jason Ludkeet al.; U.S. v. Waheba Dais).\u00a0The Office confronted the growing threat of cyber crime, successfully prosecuting individuals such as Marcus Hutchins, who created banking malware that affected victims worldwide.\u00a0 The Office also secured the conviction of Resit Tavin, a Turkish businessman, for smuggling Wisconsin-made marine products to Iran for use in the Iranian navy.\u00a0 Building on DOJ\u2019s China Initiative, Krueger worked with the FBI to initiate outreach to businesses at risk of economic espionage.\n\nPublic Corruption.The Office brought important cases to protect government integrity under U.S. Attorney Krueger\u2019s tenure.\u00a0 These included convictions of a corporation and six individuals\u2014including an accountant whose trial Krueger handled personally-- for a wide-ranging scheme to illegally obtain over $260 million in federal contracts that were set aside for minority-owned and disabled veteran-owned small businesses (U.S. v. Ganos).\u00a0 The Office also successfully prosecuted Nicole Doxator, a Milwaukee County employee, for diverting public funds; Willie Wade, a former Milwaukee alderman, for a fraud scheme in which he purported to sell access to a current alderman; and John LaFave, the Milwaukee County Register of Deeds for a scheme to subvert the County\u2019s procurement rules.\n\nHealthcare Fraud.Given the $1.2 trillion in annual federal healthcare spending, U.S. Attorney Krueger prioritized healthcare fraud enforcement.\u00a0 He created a dedicated team of prosecutors to pursue healthcare fraud using civil and criminal enforcement tools.\u00a0 The Office also improved its use of data analytics to identify indicia of fraud.\u00a0 As a result, the Office increased its healthcare fraud cases, including a settlement with Aurora Health Care, Inc. for improper payments to physicians, a settlement with Walgreens Co. for improper prescription drug claims, and multiple cases of illegal kickback schemes (U.S. v. Center for Pain Management, S.C.; U.S. v. Advanced Pain Management; U.S. v. David Guerrero).\n\nFinancial Fraud.The Office also successfully prosecuted a range of fraud that victimized the private sector, including a $9 million \u201cgreen energy\u201d investment scheme (U.S. v. Ronald Van Den Heuvel), and a $30 million scheme involving financing of luxury vehicles (U.S. v. Albert Golant).\u00a0 The Office placed particular emphasis crimes that targeted vulnerable victims such the elderly (U.S. v. Edward Matthes; U.S. v. Chris Kubiak; U.S. v.

            "article_text": "Three Florida residents have been charged in federal district court in Miami with crimes related to their alleged violations of U.S. sanctions on Iran, and money laundering.\n\nDefendants Mohammad Faghihi, 52, his wife Farzeneh Modarresi, 53, and his sister Faezeh Faghihi, 50, operated Florida company Express Gene. According to the criminal complaint affidavit, between October 2016 and November 2020, Express Gene received numerous wire transfers from accounts in Malaysia, the People\u2019s Republic of China, Singapore, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates, totaling almost $3.5 million. It is alleged that some of the money received was used by Express Gene and its principals to purchase genetic sequencing equipment from U.S. manufacturers and ship them to Iran without a license from the Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to export the machines, despite sanctions on Iran. The incoming money also was used by F. Faghihi and Modarresi to fund the 2019 purchase of the Express Gene property, says the affidavit.\n\nOn Feb. 20, Faghihi arrived at Miami International Airport from Iran, where he was inspected by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers. According to the charging documents, during his inspection by CBP officers, Faghihi made false statements, including that he did not practice his profession in Iran or conduct any type of research in Iran. In fact, according to the affidavit, Faghihi was the director of a laboratory within Shiraz University of Medical Science in Iran bearing his name: \u201cDr. Faghihi\u2019s Medical Genetic Center,\u201d. In addition, his luggage contained 17 vials of unknown biological substances covered with ice packs and concealed beneath bread and other food items, according to the affidavit. All the vials were subject to regulations.\n\nFrom approximately 2013 to approximately 2020, Faghihi was an Assistant Professor at the Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences at the University of Miami (UM), Miller School of Medicine. During this period, he was the principal investigator on several National Institute of Health (NIH) grants awarded in February 2013, December 2016 and June 2017. It is alleged that Express Gene and Faghihi received large deposits from international wires during this period, but they were not disclosed as required to either UM or NIH\u2019s financial conflict of interest reporting system.\n\nDefendants made their initial federal court appearances today. Their pretrial detention hearings will take place tomorrow, Sept. 15, at 10:00 a.m. in federal magistrate court in Miami.\n\nAll defendants are charged with conspiring to commit an offense against the United States and conspiring to commit money laundering. Faghihi and Modarresi are also charged with the unlawful exports of goods to Iran, and smuggling goods out of the United States. Faghihi and F. Faghihi were charged with smuggling goods into the United States and making false statements. Faghihi is further charged with wire fraud.\n\nActing Assistant Attorney General Mark J. Lesko for the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division; Acting U.S. Attorney Juan Antonio Gonzalez for the Southern District of Florida; Special Agent in Charge George Piro of the FBI\u2019s Miami Field Office; and Director Vernon Foret of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Miami Field Office made the announcement.\n\nFBI Miami and CBP Miami are investigating the case. The University of Miami provided invaluable assistance.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Michael Thakur and Senior Litigation Counsel Randy Hummel of the Southern District of Florida and Trial Attorney Menno Goedman of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting the case.\n\nA criminal complaint is merely an allegation, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.",

            "article_text": "It is my pleasure to welcome you to the 5th annual Massachusetts Counter-Proliferation Working Group Conference.  Thank you for taking the time to be here with us today.\n\nIn December 2007, almost six years ago, a multi-agency initiative was launched in this district to combat the growing national security threat posed by illegal exports of restricted U.S. military and dual-use technology to foreign nationals and terrorist organizations.  Since 2007,  our Counter-Proliferation Working Group, consisting of representatives of law enforcement and intelligence agencies, have been working together to coordinate investigations and share information regarding current threats and suspicious activities regarding the transfer of sensitive U.S. technology and information through illegal means.\n\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is one of the greatest threats our country faces today.  The WMD threat is not isolated to a single country.  For instance, while Iran is aggressively seeking U.S. origin goods to further its nuclear capabilities, terrorist groups are actively seeking to develop chemical weapons and obtain components for improvised explosive devices.  Preventing our adversaries from obtaining U.S. export restricted technology is therefore one of our highest priorities.  It is clear, however, that the government cannot guard our nation from this immense threat alone; we need the help of our business and academic partners to safeguard sensitive U.S. technology.\n\nIn addition, America faces a growing number of espionage threats, ranging from the activities of foreign intelligence services and terrorist groups, to emerging cyber-threats, to increasingly sophisticated operations to obtain trade secrets and technical data concerning U.S. military and dual-use technologies.  Foreign states and terrorist organizations routinely seek arms, technology, and other materials from the United States to advance their technology capacity, weapons systems, and in some cases, weapons of mass destruction programs.\n\nForeign governments are aggressive in their efforts to illegally acquire U.S. technology and technical data.  With each passing year, our adversaries become more creative and advanced in their methods to steal our technology.  For instance, they have been observed directly targeting U.S. firms; employing commercial firms in the U.S. and third countries to acquire U.S. technology; and recruiting students, professors, and scientists to engage in technology collection.\n\nThree months ago, President Obama called the cyber threat Aone of the most serious economic and national security challenges we face as a nation.@  Private companies are invaluable to handling these threats and often act as our first line of defense.   Cyber intrusions are occurring more and more frequently.  While prevention is the ultimate goal, we must also focus on disruption.  This requires your help and assistance.\n\nThe speakers today will be addressing a number of extremely important topics, including the importance of protecting US technology and technical data, how to comply with U.S. export laws, how to protect your technology, and the ongoing threat posed by cyberattacks.\n\nWe ask for your help and partnership in protecting our nation\u2019s national and economic security.  Please report any suspicious contacts, inquiries and cyber intrusions.  Even one suspicious email or call might expose an illegal procurement network or scheme to acquire critical U.S. technology.  We ask for your help in keeping our country and our military troops safe.\n\nOnce again, I thank you for your participation and continued cooperation.  I hope you all find today\u2019s conference both beneficial and interesting.\n\n",
