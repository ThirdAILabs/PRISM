City of Santa Ana</em>, a private lawsuit alleging that the City violated RLUIPA by enacting and enforcing zoning provisions that treat religious uses less favorably than secular places of assembly. The lawsuit alleges that the city\u2019s professional district allows, as of right, nonreligious assembly uses like museums and art galleries, but only allows religious assembly uses with the city\u2019s discretionary approval of a conditional use permit (CUP).&nbsp;</p><p>\u201cZoning practices that unfairly limit assemblies by faith-based groups violate federal law,\u201d said Acting United States Attorney Joseph McNally. \u201cMunicipalities cannot create zoning districts that treat houses of worship worse than comparable secular assemblies. The Justice Department will vigorously protect the right of religious institutions to receive equal treatment under the law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRLUIPA prohibits local governments from treating religious assembly uses like the Anchor Stone Church worse than comparable nonreligious assemblies,\u201d said Deputy Assistant Attorney General Mac Warner of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. \u201cZoning codes violate RLUIPA when they make it more difficult for people to gather for religious worship than for secular purposes. The Civil Rights Division will continue to vigilantly enforce RLUIPA\u2019s protections and ensure that religious groups have equal access to places to worship as a community.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>The lawsuit alleges that Anchor Stone is a small Christian church of first-generation Chinese and Taiwanese Americans. It obtained space within the city\u2019s professional district and applied for a CUP to operate a Church but was denied by the city. The Church filed a motion for preliminary injunction, seeking an order allowing it to worship at its property. The Department\u2019s statement of interest supports the Church\u2019s argument that the zoning code, on its face, treats religious uses less favorably than nonreligious assembly uses, in violation of RLUIPA\u2019s equal terms provision, and that the city has failed to justify this unequal treatment.</p><p>RLUIPA is a federal law that protects persons and religious institutions from unduly burdensome, unequal, or discriminatory land use regulations.
